<span class="medium">CONTINUATION OF THE BLACK’S VISITS TO HIS
PRISONERS.</span></h2>

<p>Having quitted the dungeon in which Josh Pedler
was confined, the Blackamoor proceeded to the next
cell; but, instead of opening the door, he merely
drew back a small sliding-lid that covered a grated
trap, and the faint rays of a light streamed from the
inside.</p>

<p>“Tidmarsh,” said the Blackamoor, in a feigned
tone, “has your mind grown easier?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;oh! yes,” replied the prisoner from
the interior of his dungeon. “Since you allowed
me a light and good books, I have been comparatively
a happy man. I know that I deserve punishment&mdash;and
it seems to do me good to feel that I am
atoning for my offences in this manner. I am not
afraid of being alone now; and when I put out my
light, I am not afraid of being in the dark.”</p>

<p>“You pray with more composure?” said the
Black, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;I can settle my mind to prayer now,”
was the answer; “and I am sure that my prayers
are heard. But pray believe, sir, that I never was
so wicked&mdash;so very wicked as that bad man who
kept me for years in his employ. I know that I
was too willing an instrument in his hands; and I
am sorry for it now. The thing that lays heaviest
on my mind, is the share I had in sending poor Tom
Rain to the scaffold.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>“You are sorry for that deed?” enquired the
Black, in a low and slightly tremulous tone.</p>

<p>“Oh! God, forgive me!” exclaimed Tidmarsh,
his voice expressing sincere contrition. “I do indeed
deeply&mdash;deeply deplore my share in that awful
business; and the ghost of poor Tom Rain used to
haunt me when I was first here. In fact, Tom Rain
was ever uppermost in my thoughts; and&mdash;strange
though it may seem&mdash;it is not the less true, sir, that
your voice appeared to penetrate to my very soul,
as if it was Tom Rain himself that was speaking to
me. But I have got over all those ideas now&mdash;since
I learnt to pray; and when I grow dull, I read the
good books you have lent me. Sometimes I study
the Bible; and I find that if I pore over it too much,
it makes me melancholy. Then I turn to the Travels
and Voyages; and I become tranquil again.”</p>

<p>“Should you not rejoice at any opportunity of retrieving
your character&mdash;even in your old age&mdash;and
earning an honest livelihood for yourself?” asked
the Black.</p>

<p>“Oh! if such a thing could be!” cried the man,
in a tone of exultation. “But, no&mdash;it is
impossible!” he added, after a pause, and speaking
in an altered voice. “I have sinned too deeply in
respect to poor Tom Rain, to be able to hope
for such happiness. God is punishing me in this
world, you being his instrument;&mdash;and yet I can
scarcely call it punishment, since you treat me with
such kindness. There are times when I even wish
that I was more severely punished <em>here</em>, so that I
might expiate all my sins and feel certain about my
fate in another world.”</p>

<p>“God is full of forgiveness, Tidmarsh,” said the
Black: “I feel that He is,” he added in a somewhat
enthusiastic manner. “The prospect I distantly
hinted at in respect to yourself, may possibly become
practicable. You are old&mdash;but you may still
have many years to live; and it would be wrong&mdash;it
would be detestable not to give you a full opportunity,
sooner or later, of enabling you to testify
your contrition. But I cannot speak farther on this
subject at present. I have brought you some more
books: one is a tale&mdash;‘<em>The Vicar of Wakefield</em>’&mdash;the
perusal of which will do you no harm. It will
show you how virtue, though suffering for a time,
was rewarded at last. In a few days I shall myself
visit you again.”</p>

<p>The Black closed the trap, and stood away from
the door, which Wilton now opened; and the basket
furnished the prisoner with his provisions and also
with some volumes of good and beneficial reading.</p>

<p>The visiting-party next proceeded to the cell in
which Toby Bunce and his wife were confined together;
and here, as in the immediately preceding
instance, the Black spoke to them through a sliding
trap, from which a light also gleamed.</p>

<p>“For three days have you now been together, after
dwelling some time apart,” said the Blackamoor,
continuing to speak in a feigned tone; “and I now
conjure you to tell me truly whether you would
rather be thus in each other’s company, or separated
as before?”</p>

<p>“Oh! leave us together, sir&mdash;leave us together,
I implore you!” cried Mrs. Bunce, in a voice of
earnest appeal. “We are now the best friends in
the world; and I have promised my husband never
to say a cross word unnecessarily to him again.”</p>

<p>“She seems quite an altered woman, sir,” observed
Toby. “But then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But then what?” demanded the Black, seeing
that the man hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well, sir&mdash;I will speak my mind free,” continued
Bunce; “because I’m no longer afraid to do so. I
was going to say that p’rhaps it is this loneliness in
which we are placed that makes Betsy talk as she
does; and that if we was to be again together out
of doors&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You would not find me change, Toby,” interrupted
the woman, but not in a querulous manner.
“I like to hear you read to me from the Bible, and
from the other good books that the gentleman has
given us. I wish we had passed more of our time in
this way before we got into all this trouble. But,
pray, sir,” she added, turning towards the door,
“do tell me whether you mean to keep us here all
our lives!”</p>

<p>“You must ask me no questions, remember,”
said the Black, in a mild but firm tone. “I have
told you this before. Learn to subdue all impatience,
and to become resigned and enduring. You
have made others suffer in the world;&mdash;you have
been the agents and tools of a wicked man;&mdash;and
you now see that heaven is punishing you through
the means of one who has power thus to treat you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how I wish that I had never known that
detestable Bones?” exclaimed the woman, covering
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>“And how I wish that I had stuck to my trade
in an honest manner!” cried Toby Bunce, in a voice
of unfeigned contrition.</p>

<p>“Think of all that&mdash;repeat those sentences to each
other&mdash;as often as you can,” said the Blackamoor.
“In the course of a few days I shall visit you again.”</p>

<p>With these words, he stood back from the door,
which Wilton opened; and the two inmates of the
dungeon received supplies of wholesome food and
moral or instructive books.</p>

<p>The party then proceeded farther along the subterranean
passage from which the various cells
opened.</p>

<p>“Do you mean, sir, to fulfil your intention of this
night visiting <em>him</em>?” enquired C&aelig;sar, addressing his
master in a low, faint, and tremulous tone, as if he
were a prey to some vague terror.</p>

<p>The Blackamoor did not immediately answer the
question; but, placing his hand upon his brow, appeared
to reflect profoundly for almost the space of
a minute.</p>

<p>Wilton&mdash;who seemed acquainted, as well as C&aelig;sar,
with all his master’s secrets&mdash;likewise surveyed the
Black with mingled curiosity and apprehension.</p>

<p>“Yes!” at length exclaimed the mysterious personage;
“I will now, for the first time since he has
been my prisoner here, hold personal communication
with Benjamin Bones!”</p>

<p>The party proceeded in silence to a cell near the
extremity of the long subterranean passage; and on
reaching it, the Black handed the lamp to C&aelig;sar, at
the same time making a sign to that youth and the
other dependants to stand back so that no gleam of
the light should penetrate into the dungeon when
the door was opened. They obeyed in profound
silence; and their master immediately entered the
cell, closing the door behind him with that rapidity
which is exercised by a brute-tamer when introducing
himself into the cage of a wild beast.</p>

<p>The interior of the dungeon was as dark as pitch,&mdash;so
dark, that there was not even that greyish
appearance which obscurity frequently wears to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
eyes accustomed to it. It was a darkness that
might be felt,&mdash;a darkness which seemed to touch
and hang upon the visual organs like a dense black
mist.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” demanded the sepulchral voice of
Old Death, his tone marked with a subdued ferocity
and a sort of savage growling which seemed to
denote a rancorous hate and pent-up longings for
bitter vengeance against the author or authors of
his solitary imprisonment.</p>

<p>“I am the person who keeps you here,” answered
the Black, studying to adopt a voice even more
feigned and unlike his natural tones than when he
was ere now addressing Tidmarsh and the Bunces.</p>

<p>Still that voice had in it some peculiarity which
appeared to touch a chord that vibrated to the very
core of Old Death’s heart; for he evidently made a
starting movement, as he said hoarsely and thickly,
“But who are you&mdash;a spectre or a living being?
Tell me who you are!”</p>

<p>“I am a living being like yourself,” was the reply,
delivered in a voice disguised in deeper modulations
than before. “Are you afraid of being visited
by spectres?”</p>

<p>There was a long pause, during which the deep
silence was interrupted only by the heavy breathing
of Old Death, as if the utter darkness of the place
sate oppressively upon him.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of spectres, I ask?” demanded
the Black, who was leaning with folded arms against
the door, and with his eyes in the direction where
he presumed Old Death to be seated; though not
even the faintest outline of his form could he trace
amidst that black obscurity.</p>

<p>“Bring me a light, or let me out&mdash;and I will answer
all your questions,” cried Benjamin Bones, his
anxiety to obtain his freedom giving a cadence of
earnest appeal to his voice in spite of the tremendous
rage which his bosom cherished against the individual
who had proclaimed himself to be his
gaoler.</p>

<p>“Do you deserve mercy?&mdash;do you merit the indulgence
of man?” asked the Black, in a tone profoundly
solemn.</p>

<p>“What do you know of me?&mdash;who are you?&mdash;why
did you have me brought here?&mdash;and by what
right do you keep me in this infernal place?” demanded
Old Death, rapidly and savagely.</p>

<p>“Is it not a just retribution which makes you a
prisoner in a subterranean where you have often
imprisoned others?” said the Black.</p>

<p>“Then ’tis that miscreant Ellingham who has put
me here!” exclaimed Bones, in a tone which showed
that he was quivering with rage. “Demon!&mdash;fiend!&mdash;yes&mdash;you
are Lord Ellingham&mdash;I thought I knew
your voice, although you tried to disguise it. At the
first moment I fancied&mdash;but that was stupid,&mdash;still
it struck me that it was the voice of Tom Rain
which spoke. Ha! ha!” the old wretch chuckled
with horrible ferocity and savage glee&mdash;“I did for
him&mdash;I did for him! I sent him to the scaffold&mdash;I
got him hanged&mdash;and now he is food for worms!
Ellingham&mdash;for I know you <em>are</em> Lord Ellingham&mdash;I
can have the laugh at you, you devil, although you
keep me here!”</p>

<p>“Miserable old man,” said the Black, in a tone of
deep pity, though still disguised in modulation,&mdash;“are
you insensible to the whisperings of conscience?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;now that you are here!” cried Benjamin
Bones, his clothes rustling as if with the trembling
nervousness of enraged excitement. “You made
me sell you these houses&mdash;you took them away
from me by force, as it were; and now you
keep me a prisoner here. It is all through vengeance
that you do it&mdash;<em>you</em> who pretended to be
above all thoughts or intentions of revenge!”</p>

<p>“As God is my judge, I harbour no such sentiment
towards you!” said the Blackamoor, emphatically.
“But will you converse tranquilly and calmly
with me?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I will try,” returned Old Death. “What
do you want to say to me?”</p>

<p>“To remind you that you are an old&mdash;very old
man, and that you cannot hope to live much
longer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fiend! would you kill me in cold blood!” interrupted
Bones, in a sort of shrieking, yelling tone
that indicated mingled alarm and rage.</p>

<p>“Had I intended to slay you, I might have done
it when you were first brought here as my prisoner,”
answered the Black. “Rest satisfied on that
head&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you do not mean to kill me?” exclaimed
Old Death, with all the hysterical joy of a coward
soul, in spite of his natural and still untamed ferocity.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” ejaculated the Blackamoor.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;now ’tis the voice of Tom Rain once
again!” cried Old Death, evidently shuddering as he
spoke. “But, no&mdash;I am a fool&mdash;you are the Earl!
Yes&mdash;tell me&mdash;are you not the Earl of Ellingham?”</p>

<p>“No matter who I am,” was the solemn reply.
“If you ask me questions, I will immediately leave
you.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;don’t go for a few minutes!” exclaimed
Old Death, imploringly. “I have been here a month,&mdash;yes&mdash;for
I have counted the visits of your men,
who come, as they tell me, every night to bring me
food,&mdash;and I know that I have been here a month.
In all that time I have only exchanged a dozen
words with human beings&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;this solitude
is horrible!”</p>

<p>“You have leisure to ponder on all your crimes,”
said the Black.</p>

<p>“Who made you my judge?” demanded Old
Death, with a return of his ferocity of tone and
manner. “If you want me to confess all my sins,
and will then set me free, I will do it,” he added in
a somewhat ironical way.</p>

<p>“Confession is useless, without true repentance,”
observed the Blackamoor. “Besides, all your misdeeds
are known to me,&mdash;your behaviour to your
half-sister, Octavia Manners, years ago&mdash;your treatment
of poor Jacob Smith&mdash;your machinations to
destroy Thomas Rainford&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then, by all this, am I convinced that you <em>are</em>
the Earl of Ellingham!” cried Old Death. “Ah!
my lord,” he immediately added, in a voice which
suddenly changed to a tone of earnest appeal, “do
not keep me here any longer! Let me go&mdash;and I
will leave London for ever! Reflect, my lord&mdash;I
am an old man&mdash;a very old man,&mdash;you yourself said
so just now,&mdash;and you are killing me by keeping me
here. Send me out of the country&mdash;any where you
choose, however distant&mdash;and I will thank you: but
again I say, do not keep me here.”</p>

<p>“When the savage animal goes about preying
upon the weak and unwary, he should be placed
under restraint,” said the Blackamoor. “You are
not repentant, Benjamin Bones! A month have you
been here&mdash;a month have you been allowed to ponder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
upon your enormities,&mdash;and still your soul is
obdurate. Not many minutes have elapsed since
you gloried in one of the most infamous deeds of
your long and wicked life.”</p>

<p>“I spoke of Tom Rain to annoy you&mdash;because I
was enraged with you for keeping me here,” returned
Old Death, hastily. “There have been moments,”
he added, after a short pause, “when I
have felt sorry for what I did in that respect. I
would not do so over again&mdash;no, my lord, I assure
you I would not! I wish your poor half-brother
was alive now&mdash;I would not seek to injure him, even
if I had the power.”</p>

<p>“You speak thus because you have been alone
and in the dark,” observed the Blackamoor, in a
mournful voice: “but were you restored to freedom&mdash;to
the enjoyment of the light of God’s own sun&mdash;and
to the possession of the power of following your
career of iniquity, you would again glory in that
dreadful deed.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Old Death: “I am sorry for it.
I know that my nature is savage and ferocious: but
will you tame me by cruelty? And your keeping me
here is downright cruelty&mdash;and nothing more or
less. It makes me vindictive&mdash;it makes me feel at
times as if I hated you.”</p>

<p>“I shall keep you here, nevertheless, for some
time longer&mdash;aye, and in the dark,” returned the
Blackamoor; “because you seek not to subdue
your revengeful feelings. It is terrible to think that
so old a man should be so inveterately wicked. Do
you know that your gang is broken up&mdash;rendered
powerless? In the cells of this subterranean are
Timothy Splint&mdash;Joshua Pedler&mdash;Mrs. Bunce and
her husband&mdash;and your agent, Tidmarsh.”</p>

<p>“Then I have no hope <em>from without</em>!” growled
Old Death, his garments again rustling with a movement
of savage impatience; and for an instant it
struck the Blackamoor that he could see two ferocious
eyes gleaming in the dark&mdash;but this was
doubtless the mere fancy of the moment.</p>

<p>“Yes,&mdash;you are beyond the reach of human aid,
unless by <em>my</em> will and consent,” said the Blackamoor.
“Your late companions or tools in iniquity
are all housed safely here;&mdash;and, what is more,
they are penitent. Listen for a moment, Benjamin
Bones; and may the information I am about to give
you, prove an instructive lesson. Timothy Splint is
at this instant reading the Bible, therein to search for
hope and consolation, which God does not deny to
the worst sinners when they are truly penitent.
Joshua Pedler is occupying himself in writing a letter
of advice to a young girl who became his mistress,
whom he drove to prostitution, but who is now
earning her livelihood in a respectable manner.
Tidmarsh deplores the folly which made him your
instrument; and he is reading good books. Bunce
and his wife are together in the same dungeon; and
the woman is rapidly yielding up to her husband
that empire which she had usurped. They too regret
that they ever knew you; and the Bible is their
solace. Of six persons whom I imprisoned in this
place which was once your own property, five are
already repentant: you, who are the sixth, alone
remain obdurate and hardened.”</p>

<p>“And my old friends curse me!” moaned the
ancient miscreant, his voice seeming more hollow
and sepulchral than ever, as if he were covering his
face with his hands. “What&mdash;the people who owe
so much to me&mdash;the Bunces&mdash;Tidmarsh&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Would not speak to you, unless it were to convert
you,” added the Black. “Thus, you perceive,
you&mdash;who, in the common course of nature, are of
all the six the nearest to the threshold of the tomb,&mdash;you,
who have so many years upon your head, and
such deep and manifold crimes to expiate,&mdash;<em>you</em>,
Benjamin Bones,” continued the warning voice,
“are the last to show the slightest&mdash;the faintest
sign of penitence. Is not this deplorable? And
even now you appear to regret that your late companions
in crime should be in their hearts thus
alienated from you. Doubtless you trusted to the
chapter of accidents&mdash;to the hazard of chances to
enable them to discover your place of imprisonment
and effect your rescue?”</p>

<p>Old Death groaned heavily, in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Yes:&mdash;such was your hope&mdash;such was your
idea,” resumed the Black; “and now you are unmanned
by disappointment. Even your friend Jeffreys
turned against you&mdash;he led you into the snare
which I set for you&mdash;he will not raise an arm to
save you from my power. He does not even know
where you are.”</p>

<p>“Then I am abandoned by all the world!”
shrieked forth the wretched miscreant, unable to
subdue the agonising emotions which this conviction
excited within him.</p>

<p>“He who finds himself abandoned by all the world,
should throw himself upon his Maker,” said the
Blackamoor.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;there&mdash;’tis the voice of Rainford again!”
cried Old Death, evidently seized with ineffable
terror. “But, no&mdash;no&mdash;you are the Earl of Ellingham&mdash;you
must be the Earl! Yet why do you
every now and then imitate the tone of Tom Rain?
Is it to frighten me, my lord? Tell me&mdash;is it to
frighten me?”</p>

<p>“You seem inaccessible to fear of any kind,”
answered the Black,&mdash;“I mean a fear which may be
permanent and salutary. You have occasional
qualms of conscience, which you cannot altogether
resist, but which almost immediately pass away.
Have you no wish to make your peace with heaven?
Would you pray with a clergyman, were one to
visit you?”</p>

<p>“No:&mdash;I am unfit for prayer&mdash;I should not have
the patience to stand the questioning of a clergyman,”
answered Old Death hastily: then, almost
immediately afterwards, he said, “But I was wrong
to give such a reply! Yes&mdash;send me a clergyman&mdash;let
him bring a light&mdash;do any thing to relieve me
from this solitude and this darkness. My lord&mdash;for
I know that you are the Earl of Ellingham&mdash;pray
take compassion upon me! I am an old&mdash;a
very old man, my lord; and I cannot endure this
confinement. I told you just now that I was sorry
for what I did to your brother-in-law; and you know
that I cannot recall him to life. Neither will you
do so by killing me. Have mercy upon me, then,
my lord: let me leave this horrible place&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To enter the great world again, and renew your
course of crime?” interrupted the Black. “No&mdash;Benjamin
Bones, that may not be! Let me first
become assured that you sincerely and truly repent
of your misdeeds&mdash;let me be impressed with the conviction
that you are sorry for the crimes which have
marked your long life,&mdash;and then&mdash;<em>then</em>, we will
speak of ameliorating your condition. For the
present, do not consider me as your enemy&mdash;do not
look upon me as a man acting towards you from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
vindictive motives only. No:&mdash;for were I inclined
to vent on you a miserable spite or a fiendish malignity,
the means are not deficient. I might keep you
without food for days together&mdash;but each day your
provender is renewed: or I might even kill you outright&mdash;and
yet I would not violently injure a hair of
your head! To-morrow evening I will visit you
again: in the meantime endeavour to subdue your
feelings so that you may then speak to me without
irritation.”</p>

<p>With these words the Black abruptly thrust the
door open, and quitted the dungeon; but at that
instant C&aelig;sar, who had been pacing up and down
with Wilton in the immediate vicinity of that particular
cell, was so close to the entrance that the
light of the lamp which he carried in his hand
streamed full upon the countenance of his master as
the latter sprang forth from the deep darkness of
Old Death’s prison-house.</p>

<p>The glare for a moment showed the interior of
the dungeon; and the Black, mechanically turning
his eyes towards the place where he presumed Benjamin
Bones to be, caught a rapid glimpse of the
hideous old man, seated&mdash;or rather crouched on his
bed, his hands clasped round his knees, and his form
so arched that his knees and chin almost appeared
to meet.</p>

<p>In another instant the dungeon-door was closed
violently by the Blackamoor, who, as he locked and
barred it, said in a low and somewhat reproachful
tone to C&aelig;sar, “You should not have been so incautious
as to throw the light upon me just as I
was leaving the cell. Old Death had time, even in
that single moment during which the glare flashed
upon my countenance, to observe me distinctly.”</p>

<p>“I am truly sorry, sir, that I should have been go
imprudent,” answered C&aelig;sar, in a tone of vexation
at his fault. “But it is impossible that he could
recognise you.”</p>

<p>“I believe so,” observed the Black: “and therefore
we will say no more upon the subject. The
old man remains obdurate and hardened,” he continued,
still speaking in a low whisper; “and yet I
have hopes of him as well as of the others.”</p>

<p>Wilton supplied Benjamin Bones with provisions
through the trap in his dungeon-door; and the party
then quitted the subterranean by the mode of egress
communicating with the house in Red Lion Street,
Clerkenwell&mdash;for the reader now perceives, as indeed
he may long ago have conjectured, that the Black’s
dwelling was established in the quarters lately
tenanted by Old Death.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXI">CHAPTER CXI.<br />

<span class="medium">A CONVERSATION.</span></h2>

<p>Pass we over another month&mdash;eight weeks having
now elapsed since the six prisoners were first consigned
to their dungeons, and four weeks from the
date of those visits the description of which has
occupied the two proceeding chapters.</p>

<p>It was between nine and ten o’clock in the evening;
and the Blackamoor was seated in his apartment,
looking over some letters, when C&aelig;sar ushered
in Dr. Lascelles.</p>

<p>“Good evening, my dear sir,” said the Blackamoor,
shaking the worthy physician cordially by
the hand. “Be seated&mdash;and C&aelig;sar will bring us a
bottle of that claret which you so much admire. I
am delighted that you have at length found time to
give me an hour or two, in order that I may enter
into full and complete explanations of certain
matters&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand&mdash;I understand,” interrupted the
doctor, good humouredly. “Your theory has proved
to me more practical than I expected: but I shall
not say any more about it until you have given me
all the details of its progress. And before you begin,
I must observe that the case which took me out of
town six weeks ago, and has kept me at Brighton
all the time, has ended most satisfactorily. I have
effected a complete cure.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear tidings so glorious from
you, doctor,” said the Black. “A case which had
baffled all the physicians who had previously been
concerned in it, is now conducted to a successful
issue by yourself. It will wondrously and deservedly
increase your reputation, great as that fame already
was.”</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” replied the physician, “without
for a moment seeking to recall any thing unpleasant
connected with the past, I must inform you that
galvanism was the secret of the grand cure which
I have effected. But let us pass on to another
subject,” exclaimed the doctor hastily, as if considerately
turning the discourse from a disagreeable
topic. “I have been absent for six weeks&mdash;quite
a strange thing for me, who am so wedded to
London; and you are one of the very first of my
friends on whom I call. All day long I have been
paying hurried visits to my patients; and now I
come to sit a couple of hours with you. I suppose
you have plenty of news for me?”</p>

<p>“None of any consequence beyond the sphere of
my own affairs in this place,” answered the Black.
“You are of course aware that the Earl has made
Esther an offer of his hand&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To be sure, my dear friend,” interrupted Lascelles:
“that engagement was contracted, you remember,
two or three weeks before I left London,
when summoned to Brighton. But I presume that
the Earl is still ignorant of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All my proceedings?” exclaimed the Black,
finishing the sentence for the physician. “Yes&mdash;he
remains completely in the dark respecting every
thing. The time may, however, soon come when he
shall be made acquainted with all; and then I do not
think he will blame me.”</p>

<p>“Far from it!” cried Lascelles, emphatically:
“he doubtless owes you his happiness, if not his life&mdash;for
there is no telling what that miscreant, Old
Death, might not have done to gratify his frightful
cravings for vengeance. The monster!” exclaimed
the physician, indignantly: “he would even have
inflicted the most terrible outrages and wrongs upon
the amiable Esther and the generous-souled Lady
Hatfield, in order to wound the heart of the Earl.”</p>

<p>“And yet I do not despair of reforming that man,
bad as he is,” observed the Black.</p>

<p>“Reform the Devil!” cried the doctor. “But I
will not anticipate by any hasty opinion of mine the
explanations which you are going to give me. By
the bye, have you had any intelligence relative to
that Mr. Torrens?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Black. “Esther received a
letter from his daughter Rosamond a few days ago.
The poor girl and her father were on their way to
Switzerland, where they intended to settle in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
secluded spot. The old gentleman is worn down and
spirit-broken; and Rosamond states that she is afraid
he is oppressed with some secret care beyond those
with which she is acquainted.”</p>

<p>“And your man Jeffreys?” said Lascelles, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“The next time you visit Hackney, doctor,&mdash;should
your professional avocations take you to that
suburb,” replied the Blackamoor, “forget not to
look out for the most decent grocer’s shop in Mare
Street; and over the door you will see the name of
<span class="smcap">John Jeffreys</span>. He entered the establishment
only a few days ago; and I believe he is a reformed
man. I tried his fidelity as well as his steadiness
in many ways, during the last two months; and I
have every reason to entertain the best hopes relative
to him. At all events, he has every chance of
earning an honest and good living; for he has purchased
an old-established business, which Wilton
previously ascertained to be a profitable concern.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard or seen anything lately of our
friend Sir Christopher Blunt?” enquired the physician,
laughing as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I have not seen him since that memorable night
when he fulfilled the duties of a magistrate in this
room,” answered the Black, smiling: “but I have
occasionally heard of him. He is so puffed up with
pride in consequence of the importance which he
derived from his adventure here, that he looks upon
himself as a perfect demigod. By the bye, I saw an
advertisement in this day’s papers, announcing the
speedy publication of the ‘<em>The Life and Times of
Sir Christopher Blunt. By Jeremiah Lykspittal, Esq.
With numerous Portraits; and containing a mass
of interesting correspondence between the Subject of
the Biography and the most Eminent Deceased Men
of the present Century.</em>’ So ran the advertisement.”</p>

<p>“At which you of course laughed heartily,” exclaimed
the doctor. “But here is C&aelig;sar with the
wine&mdash;and long enough he has been in fetching it
up, too.”</p>

<p>The lad made some excuse, placed the decanters
and glasses on the table, and then withdrew.</p>

<p>“Now for the promised explanations, my friend,”
cried the physician, as he helped himself to the
purple juice of Bordeaux.</p>

<p>“First,” began the Blackamoor, “I shall speak
to you of the six prisoners generally&mdash;or rather of
my system, as applied to them. My belief originally
was that bad men should become to a certain extent
the reformers of themselves through the medium
of their own thoughts. It is not sufficient, I
reasoned within myself, that criminals should be
merely placed each night in a situation to think and
reflect, and then enjoy the light of the glorious day
again. A night’s meditations may be poignant and
provocative of a remorse of a salutary kind: but
when the day dawns, the mind becomes hardened
again, and all disagreeable redactions fly away. The
most guilty wretches fear not spectres in the day-time:
’tis in the darkness and silence of the night
that phantoms haunt them. In a word, then, the
natural night is not long enough to make an impression
so deep that the ensuing day can not easily
obliterate it.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the physician: “I follow
you attentively.”</p>

<p>“These considerations,” resumed the Black, “led
me to the conclusion that a wicked man’s thoughts
could only be rendered available as a means to induce
sincere repentance and excite a permanent remorse,
by extending their train to a long, long
period. If a night of a few short hours’ duration
would produce a very partial and limited effect upon
the mind of a criminal, I reasoned&mdash;why not make
<em>a night</em> of many weeks, and hope for a proportionately
grand and striking result? Accordingly, I
resolved to subject those six prisoners to the test;
and I will now give you a detailed account of the
consequences.”</p>

<p>“Proceed,” said the physician: “I am becoming
deeply interested.”</p>

<p>“The six prisoners were each placed in a separate
cell, and not allowed any light in the first instance,”
continued the Blackamoor. “Each dungeon was
plainly but comfortably furnished; and every evening
they were supplied with a sufficiency of food for
four-and-twenty hours. They were ordered to perform
their ablutions regularly under pain of having
their meat stopped; and you may be sure that they
did not fail to obey the command. Twice a week
the men were shaved by one of my people; and
twice a week also they were supplied with clean
linen. The woman was of course provided with
additional changes; and as her health was more
likely to suffer than that of the men, I allowed her
to walk up and down the long subterranean for two
hours each day, watched by Wilton so that she
might not communicate with either of the prisoners.
But I am now about to enter on details connected
with each individual.”</p>

<p>The physician drew his chair a little closer to the
Black.</p>

<p>“Tidmarsh was the first who showed any signs
of contrition,” resumed the latter. “He could not
endure that one, long, endless <em>night</em> into which I
had plunged him,&mdash;a night interrupted only by the
short and regular visits of myself or my people. He
was ever alone with his own thoughts, which no
intervals of a long day broke in upon: the impression
created by his thoughts was ever in his mind&mdash;the
<em>continuous night</em> kept that impression <em>there</em>! By
degrees he began to see the error of his ways&mdash;and,
when his thoughts were on one occasion intolerable,
and his imagination was filled with frightful images,
he had recourse to prayer. The next time I visited
him he assured me that his prayers had relieved
him, but that he could not sufficiently settle his
mind to pray so often as he desired. That was the
moment to give this man a light; and I did so. At
the same time I offered him his choice between the
Bible and a Tale-book; and he chose the former
with unaffected readiness. Had he selected the
latter, I should have seen that he craved for amusement
only&mdash;and he would have had neither lamp
nor books until he had gone through a farther ordeal
of his lonely thoughts in utter darkness. Well&mdash;this
Tidmarsh, by the aid of the light, was enabled
to study the Bible and settle his soul to prayer. But
a continual and unvaried perusal of the Bible is
calculated to render the mind morbid, and convert
a sinner into a grossly superstitious fanatic. Accordingly,
when I saw that Tidmarsh began to grow
gloomy&mdash;which was in a very few days&mdash;I gave him
books of Travels and Voyages; and his soul was refreshed
by the change. The improvement in that
man was far more rapid than I could have possibly
anticipated. During my visits to him, I tested his
sincerity in a variety of ways,&mdash;by means of questions
so artfully contrived as to admit of two kinds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
of answers: namely, one kind hypocritical, and the
other sincere&mdash;and at the same time implying a sort
of promise of release if the hypocritical reply were
given. But I found him straight-forward and truly
conscientious in his answers. In due time I allowed
him such novels as ‘<em>The Vicar of Wakefield</em>,’ ‘<em>Paul
and Virginia</em>,’ ‘<em>Elizabeth, or the Exiles of Siberia</em>,’
to read: but I found that he preferred the Travels,
Voyages, and Biographies of good or great men.
Indeed, scarcely six weeks had elapsed from the
date of that man’s incarceration in the dungeon,
when I felt convinced that he was so far a reformed
character as to be anxious to earn an honest livelihood
if he were only afforded the chance. Then I
removed him from his dungeon, and lodged him in
a room up stairs. He was still in reality a prisoner,
because any attempt to escape on his part would have
been immediately detected&mdash;so narrowly yet secretly
was he watched. To him, however, it must have
seemed that he was free: but he never evinced the
least inclination to avail himself of the apparent
liberty which he enjoyed. Every circumstance spoke
in that man’s favour; and the night before last he
was sent off, in company with one of my dependants,
to Portsmouth, whence they embarked together
for the little island of Alderney, where Tidmarsh
is to settle in a small way of business, to
establish which the means will be found him. My
retainer will remain for a few weeks&mdash;or perhaps
months&mdash;so as thoroughly to watch his conduct;
and if during that period, and in a place where there
are no evil temptations, he manifests an uniform
steadiness of conduct, I think we may safely calculate
that there is no fear of a relapse.”</p>

<p>“And all this has been effected in two short
months!” exclaimed the physician, with a tone and
manner indicative of mingled surprise and admiration.
“I could scarcely have believed it possible.”</p>

<p>“Listen to my next case, doctor,” said the Black;
“and you will see that my system is most salutary.
I shall speak of the two Bunces collectively. The
man Bunce I always looked upon rather as a soft-pated,
hen-pecked fool than a radically wicked
fellow; and accordingly, the moment he began to
exhibit very serious alarm and horror at being alone
and in the dark, I gave him a lamp and the Bible.
The <em>length of night</em> which I made him endure was
not more than two-thirds of a week. In respect to
his wife, the first demonstration of repentance
which she showed, was in a desire to speak to her
husband if only for a few minutes and through the
trap-door of his cell. Of course I issued orders that
the request should be complied with; and it was
evident that the woman derived comfort from this
indulgence. Next day she was permitted to converse
with him at the trap-door for nearly half an
hour; and then she was overheard begging his pardon
for the ill-treatment which he had so often endured
at her hands. For many, many successive
days this short intercourse was allowed them; and
on one occasion, Toby Bunce read her a few verses
from the Bible, he being in his cell with the lamp,
and she standing outside his door in the dark subterranean
passage. The manner in which she received
the passage thus read to her, induced me
to order that she also should be provided with a
light and a Testament: for the <em>night</em> which she endured,
and which could scarcely be said to have
been even interrupted by the daily walk in the dark
passage, was just <em>three weeks</em>. It gave me pain,
doctor&mdash;oh! it gave me pain, I can assure you, to
punish that woman so severely: but her mind was
very obdurate&mdash;her heart very hardened;&mdash;and darkness
was long before it produced on her the effect
which I desired. At length, a few days after she
had been allowed a lamp,&mdash;and a little more than
one month ago&mdash;I yielded to her earnest entreaties
that she might be lodged with her husband. Then
what a change had taken place in her! She was
tamed&mdash;completely tamed,&mdash;no longer a vixenish
shrew, but questioning her husband mildly and in a
conciliating tone relative to the passages of the
Bible, or the Travels and other instructive books,
which he had read to her. Good feelings appeared
to establish themselves rapidly between this couple.
I had them put to several tests. On one occasion
Wilton persuaded Toby Bunce that he was not
looking very well, and some little luxury was added
to the evening’s supply of food, it being intimated
that the extra dish was expressly for himself. Wilton
remained near the cell, and listened to what
passed within. Bunce insisted upon sharing the
delicacy with his wife; and she would not hear of
such a proposal. He urged his offer&mdash;she was positive;
and in this point she once again showed a
resolution of her own, but not in a manner to give
her husband offence. The very next day&mdash;this
was a week ago&mdash;I had the pair removed to a
chamber over-head, giving them the same apparent
chance of escape as in the case of Tidmarsh. They
did not however seek to avail themselves of it; and
yesterday evening they were separated again&mdash;but
only for a short time. In fact, Bunce was last night
sent off to Southampton, in company with one of
my people; and thence they doubtless embarked for
the island of Sark this morning. Mrs. Bunce will
leave presently, guarded by my faithful dependant
Harding and his wife, who will not only take her
to rejoin her husband in the little islet opposite
Guernsey, but will also stay with them there for a
period of six months. Bunce will follow his trade
as a tailor, Harding finding a market for the clothes
which he makes in St. Peter’s Port, which is the
capital of Guernsey, as you are well aware.”</p>

<p>“So far, so good,” exclaimed the physician, highly
delighted with these explanations. “Should your
system produce results permanently beneficial, you
may become a great benefactor to the human race;
for it is assuredly far better to reform the wicked
by a course of a few weeks’ training by playing
upon their feelings in this manner, than to subject
them to the contamination of a felons’ gaol and inflict
years of exile under circumstances which are
utterly repugnant to all hopes of reformation. But
pray answer me one question. Should either of
these Bunces, or Tidmarsh choose to resist the control
and authority of your dependants who have
charge of them at present&mdash;and should any one of
those quasi-prisoners demand their unconditional
freedom&mdash;how can your men exercise a power or
sway over them?”</p>

<p>“These quasi-prisoners, as you term them,”
answered the Black, “have not, as a matter of
course, the least idea who I really am. Their minds,
somewhat attenuated by their incarceration and all
the mysterious circumstances of their captivity, are
to a certain extent over-awed. They know that
they have been, and still believe themselves to be,
in the power of one who wields an authority which
they cannot comprehend; and fear alone, if no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
better motive, therefore renders them tractable. This
ensures their obedience and their silence at least for
the present. Eventually, when they again become
accustomed to freedom, they will find themselves
placed in a position to earn an honest and very comfortable
livelihood&mdash;care being taken to keep alive
in their minds the conviction that the business
which produces them their bread and enables them
to live respectably, only remains their own so long
as they prove worthy of enjoying its advantages.
Now, my calculations and beliefs are these:&mdash;People
who have entered upon a course of crime, continue
in it because it is very difficult, and often impossible,
to leave it for honest pursuits. But when once
they have experienced the dreadful effects of crime,
and are placed in a way to act and labour honestly,
very few indeed would <em>by choice</em> relapse into evil
courses. Therefore, I conclude and hope that the
Bunces on the one hand, and Tidmarsh on the other,
will, if from mere motives of policy and convenience
alone, steadily continue in that honest path in
which they are now placed, and the advantages of
which they will soon experience.”</p>

<p>“Good again,” said that doctor. “If your calculations
only applied to six criminals out of ten, you
would be effecting an immense good by means of
your system. But I hope and indeed am inclined to
believe that the proportion in your favour is even
larger.”</p>

<p>“I am certain that it is,” answered the Blackamoor.
“Well, I now come to Timothy Splint&mdash;the
man, who, as you may remember, was the actual
assassin of Sir Henry Courtenay.”</p>

<p>“If you succeed in redeeming that fellow,” exclaimed
the physician, “I shall say that your system
can have no exceptions. Stay, though!” he cried,
a thought striking him;&mdash;“I had forgotten Old
Death. Ah! my dear friend, you may as well endeavour
to tame the boa-constrictor, as to reform
that dreadful man.”</p>

<p>“You shall hear of him in his turn,” said the
Black, his tone assuming a slight degree of mournfulness,
as if he were less satisfied in respect to the
application of his system to Old Death, than in either
of the other cases. “For the present,” he observed,
“you must have patience enough to listen to certain
details relative to Timothy Splint.”</p>

<p>“Go on, my dear friend,” cried Dr. Lascelles. “I
am all attention&mdash;and patience too, for that matter.
Your narrative is too interesting to be tedious.”</p>

<p>“Timothy Splint,” continued the Blackamoor,
“appeared to suffer more horribly from the darkness
than all the others. The spectre of the murdered
baronet was constantly by his side, and even
prevented him from committing self-destruction.
For a whole month did his <em>night</em> continue; and
during that period he must have endured the most
frightful mental tortures. This was all the better:
such a state of mind naturally drove the man to pray;&mdash;and
prayer relieved him. I remember how touchingly,
although in his rude style, he assured me one
evening that when he prayed the spectre grew less
and less. Now, notwithstanding I was well pleased
to find him in this frame of mind, I did not choose
to encourage superstitious notions: and therefore I
explained to him that the only apparitions which
existed were those that were conjured up by a guilty
conscience. At the expiration of, I think, exactly
thirty-one days, I allowed this man a light and a
Bible. Then I pursued the same treatment with
him as in respect to Tidmarsh and the Bunces: I
mean, I gave him books of Travels and Voyages and
moral Tales. He seemed very grateful&mdash;not only
seemed, but really was; and his hard heart was
melted by my kind treatment. A few days ago, he
gave me the outlines of his early life; and I found
that circumstances had driven him into the ways of
crime. His reformation was, therefore, all the easier;
because he had a youth of innocence to look back
upon and regret. He moreover assured me that
even with his late companion in crime, Josh Pedler,
he had frequently spoken, in mournful mood, of the
unhappiness which often marks the hours of men
of lawless character; and, all these circumstances
tended to give strength and consistency to his declarations
that he longed&mdash;deeply longed to have an
opportunity of earning an honest livelihood for the
future. What to do with him I scarcely knew.
Whenever I reflected on this subject, I remembered
that he was a murderer&mdash;stained with the blood of
a fellow-creature; and his case was therefore widely
different from that of the Bunces and Tidmarsh.
At length it struck me that emigration to a far-distant
land was the only fitting course to adopt;
and I proposed it to him. He was rejoiced at the
idea; for he instantly saw how, by changing his
name, and commencing the world anew in another
sphere, he should be removed from old haunts where
either unpleasant reminiscences would be awakened,
or temptations present themselves. Moreover, he
beheld the necessity of repairing to some part of the
earth where he stood no chance of being recognised
by either friend or foe. His consent to my proposed
arrangement being thus obtained, and all his best
hopes and feelings being warmly enlisted in the
plan, I had then to ascertain whether any one of my
dependants would consent to accompany such a man
on a long voyage and to a far-off clime. Fortunately
my enquiries amongst my retainers were followed
by success; and at a very early hour this morning
Timothy Splint and his guardian, or rather companion,
set off for Liverpool, thence to embark for
the United States. There, in the backwoods of the
Far West, let us hope that this man&mdash;this murderer,
whom the savage law would have <em>hanged</em>,”&mdash;and
the Blackamoor shuddered, as he pronounced the
word,&mdash;“let us hope, I say, that Timothy Splint
will some day rise into a substantial farmer, and
that he may yet live to bless the period when he
went through the ordeal of the subterranean dungeon.”</p>

<p>The Black paused, and drank a glass of the cooling
claret; for his mouth had grown parched by the
simple fact of giving utterance to <em>that one word</em> on
which he had shudderingly laid so great an emphasis.
The physician, who appeared to guess full
well what was passing in his mind, made no remark;
and in a few moments the other continued his explanations
in the ensuing manner:&mdash;</p>

<div id="i_009" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I now come to Joshua Pedler. His disposition
is naturally savage and brutal; and <em>a long night of
darkness</em> produced on him effects which varied at
different periods. His thoughts were dreadful to
him; and sometimes, when I visited him, he would
at first speak ferociously. But a kind word on
my part immediately reduced him to meekness. He
had not been many days in the dungeon when,
doubtless encouraged by my manner towards him,
he told me that he was not only unhappy on his
own account, but also on that of a young woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
whom he had married according to the rights of the
vile class with which he had so long herded. I immediately
undertook to provide for the girl; and
Pedler really demonstrated a sincere gratitude. You
need scarcely be told that I kept my promise.
Wilton sought her out; and she was found in a
state of starvation and despair. A comfortable
lodging was taken for her; and when she was somewhat
restored to health, needle-work was supplied
her. But all this was done without allowing her to
believe that any other circumstance beyond a mere
accidental discovery of her wretched condition had
thus rendered her the object of Wilton’s charity.
The assurance which I gave Pedler that Matilda
was provided for, had a most salutary effect upon
his mind; although he frequently afterwards showed
signs of savage impatience. The tenour of his
thoughts was chiefly a regret that he had been so
foolish as to pursue an evil career. He reproached
himself for the folly of his wickedness, rather than
for the wickedness itself, he disliked solitude and
darkness, but was not so much influenced by fears
as his late companion, Splint. During the first
month he remained in darkness, and never once
spoke to me of prayer. Two or three times he alluded
to the Bible, but did not express a wish to
read it. At last he admitted to me his conviction
that the thoughts which oppressed him were beneficial
to him, though most unpleasant. I fancied
this to be a favourable opportunity to test his
worthiness to receive some indulgence. I accordingly
asked him if he would like to be able to write
to Matilda. My calculation was just: I had touched
him in a vulnerable point;&mdash;and he was that night
allowed a lamp and writing-materials. Moreover,
on that very occasion, he shed tears; and I no longer
despaired of taming the last remnants of ferocity
which lingered in his nature. A few days afterwards
he gave me a letter to send to Matilda. Of
course I opened and read it; for it was to obtain a
precise insight into the real state of his mind that
I had suggested the correspondence with his mistress.
The contents of that document confirmed
the hopes I already entertained of him; and I saw
that his affection for that young woman might be
made a most humanizing means in respect to him.
I accordingly had her brought into this house, and
lodged in one of the attics. Then I broke to her as
gently as possible the fact that Joshua Pedler was
my prisoner. I shall not pause to describe her joy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
at receiving intelligence concerning him; suffice it
to say that she read his letter with tearful eyes, and
gladly consented to reply to it. In the evening I
took her answer to the prisoner; and he wept over
it like a child. I then knew that his reformation
was a certainty. Two or three days afterwards, he
begged me to allow him a Bible; and his request
was of course complied with. The correspondence
that passed between him and Matilda was
frequent and lengthy; and, that he might feel
himself under no restraint, I assured him that I
neither saw his letters nor his replies. ’Twas a
falsehood on my part&mdash;but a necessary, and therefore
an innocent one. For I <em>did</em> peruse all this
correspondence; and Matilda was aware of the fact
by which I was enabled to watch the gradual but
sudden change that was taking place in the mind of
that man. At length I perceived that I might in
safety think of providing for him elsewhere; and I
was as much embarrassed how to accomplish this
aim, as I was in the case of Timothy Splint. But
in the midst of my bewilderment I happened to notice
an advertisement in a daily newspaper, stating
that by a particular day two men, or a man and his
wife, were required to undertake the care of Eddystone
Light-house. You may start with surprise,
doctor&mdash;you may even smile: but I assure you that
this advertisement appeared most providentially to
concur with the object I had in view. Without a
moment’s delay I spoke to Matilda respecting the
matter; and she expressed her readiness to follow
my advice in all things, so long as there was a prospect
of her being reunited to Josh Pedler. Her
consent being procured, it was no difficult task to
obtain that of the man. On the contrary, he accepted
the proposal with joy and thankfulness.
Wilton soon made the necessary enquiries and arrangements;
and at this moment Joshua Pedler
and the young woman are the sole inmates of the
Eddystone Light-house!”</p>

<p>“Thus, my dear friend,” said the physician, counting
the names of the persons upon his fingers, “you
have disposed of Tidmarsh in Alderney&mdash;the Bunces
are to go to Sark&mdash;Splint is bound as an emigrant
to the Far West&mdash;and Joshua Pedler is on the
Eddystone rock.”</p>

<p>“And Pedler is the only one who is unaccompanied
by an agent of mine,” observed the Black;
“because Matilda is a good young woman; and I
can rely upon her. Moreover I should tell you that
I procured a license for them; and Wilton saw them
legally married at Plymouth, before they embarked
for the Light-house.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you upon the success of your
projects thus far,” said the physician. “It is truly
wonderful how admirably you have managed thus
to redeem and satisfactorily dispose of some of
the greatest villains that ever lurked in the low
dens of this metropolis. But now, my friend, I
wish to hear something of that arch-miscreant, Old
Death.”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened; and one of the
Black’s dependants entered the room.</p>

<p>“The woman Bunce, sir,” he said, “is most
anxious to communicate something to you before
she quits London. She declares that she has a secret
preying upon her mind&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A secret?” exclaimed the Black.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;a secret which she says she must reveal
to you, as it is too heavy for her heart to bear.
She cried a great deal, and implored me to come to
you.”</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said the Blackamoor, after a few moments’
profound reflection, “you know wherefore
I do not wish that woman to behold my features&mdash;even
though they be thus disguised. During her
incarceration I never spoke to her save through the
trap of her dungeon door; and since she has been an
inmate of the house I have not visited her. It will
be as well to continue this precaution: do you, then,
hasten to her and receive the confession, whatever
it be, which she has to make.”</p>

<p>“Willingly,” replied Lascelles; and he followed
the servant from the room.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXII">CHAPTER CXII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE CONVERSATION CONCLUDED.</span></h2>

<p>Upwards of a quarter of an hour had elapsed,
when Dr. Lascelles returned to the apartment in
which he had left the Blackamoor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed the physician, throwing himself
into the chair which he had recently occupied;
“that woman is indeed penitent&mdash;truly penitent!”</p>

<p>“What proof have you acquired of this fact,
doctor?” demanded the Black.</p>

<p>“The confession which she has just made to me&mdash;or
rather the motive which induced her to make
it,” answered Lascelles. “But not to keep you in
suspense, my dear friend, she has revealed something
which only confirms a suspicion that you
yourself had long ago entertained, if I remember
right.”</p>

<p>“And that suspicion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is relative to Jacob Smith,” added Lascelles.</p>

<p>“Ah! the woman has confessed it?” exclaimed
the Blackamoor.</p>

<p>“She has confessed that Jacob Smith is her own
son, and that Benjamin Bones is his father,” replied
the physician, in a solemn tone.</p>

<p>“My God! what a parent that man has been!”
cried the Black, his brows contracting, and his voice
indicating the emotions of horror that were suddenly
excited within him. “When I recall to mind every
detail of the history of poor Jacob,&mdash;his neglected
infancy&mdash;his corrupted youth,&mdash;when I reflect
that his own father was the individual who
coolly and deliberately initiated him in the ways of
crime&mdash;&mdash;Just heavens! I begin to think with
you that the reformation of such a monster is an
impossibility!”</p>

<p>“Subdue your excitement, my dear friend,” said
the doctor; “and let us converse calmly and reasonably
upon these matters.”</p>

<p>“First, then, explain to me the nature of your
interview with Mrs. Bunce,” observed the Black. “I
shall listen with earnest attention.”</p>

<p>“I went up stairs to the room in which she is
located,” said Lascelles; “and she rose from a chair
the moment I entered; but she started back in
evident disappointment mingled with surprise when
she saw me. ‘<em>It was not you, sir</em>,’ she almost immediately
observed, ‘<em>that I wanted to see. I know
that the master of this house is of dark complexion;
for I have caught a glimpse of him when he has visited
my dungeon below.</em>’&mdash;I explained to her that I was a
friend of yours, and that you had deputed me to
receive any confession which she had to make. She
appeared to hesitate for a moment, and then burst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
into tears. ‘<em>I have been wicked&mdash;very wicked, sir</em>,’
she said, in a voice broken by deep sobs; ‘<em>and it is
only very lately that I have had my eyes opened to my
sinful life. The dark gentleman, who I suppose is the
master here, has done this good thing for me: and
now he is going to provide for me and my husband.
But I shall not go away happy, unless I tell him every
thing that weighs on my soul.</em>’&mdash;I spoke a few words
of comfort to her; and in a few minutes she confessed
that the lad who bore the name of Jacob
Smith is her own son, born while she was the mistress
of Old Death, and before her marriage with
Bunce. I informed her that Jacob was well provided
for and happy; and she seemed deeply grateful for
this assurance. Then I recommended her not to
reveal this secret to her husband when they should
be united again; inasmuch as, having entered on a
new phase of existence together, it would be useless
and wrong to acquaint him with a fact calculated
only to disturb that harmony. She promised to
follow my advice, and appeared much eased in mind
by having unbosomed her secret to me.”</p>

<p>“You gave her most excellent counsel, doctor,”
said the Black: then, after a few moments’ reflection,
he added, “Jacob ought not to be informed of
this secret of his hideous parentage&mdash;&mdash;at least not
for the present.”</p>

<p>“By no means!” exclaimed the physician. “His
mind is tranquil&mdash;he feels a certain confidence in
himself&mdash;and your friendship is his greatest delight.
Let not that salutary equanimity be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it would be wrong and useless,” said the
Black, musing. “I remember that in the course of
the long narrative which he gave me of his life, he
mentioned the occasional scintillations of kindness
which marked the conduct of Mrs. Bunce towards
him. I also recollect that he observed to me how
there were moments when he thought a great deal
of any gentle words which she ever uttered to him,
or any kind treatment she ever showed him.”</p>

<p>“Nature, my dear friend&mdash;Nature!” exclaimed
the good physician. “Even in a woman so bad as
she was at the time of which he spoke, there were
certain natural yearnings which she could not altogether
subdue; while, on his part, there existed
filial inclinations and tendencies which he could not
understand. How much that villain Benjamin
Bones has to answer for!”</p>

<p>“Alas&mdash;alas! I fear that he is beyond redemption!”
cried the Black, bitterly. “But&mdash;no,” he
added immediately afterwards, in a changed and
more decided tone: “we must not despair!”</p>

<p>“I am now anxiously waiting to hear your report
concerning him,” observed Lascelles.</p>

<p>“He is still in darkness&mdash;<em>his night</em> still continues,”
was the answer. “A month has elapsed since I
visited him for the first time in his dungeon; and
during the other four weeks that have subsequently
passed, I have had several interviews with him in
the same manner. These interviews have taken
place in the utter obscurity of his cell; and I have
been constrained, though with pain and difficulty, to
assume a feigned tone on each of those occasions.
At my first visit he declared, in terror and amazement,
that he recognised in my voice something
which reminded him of that of Thomas Rainford;
and then he seemed to be impressed with the conviction
that I was the Earl of Ellingham. His rage
against the Earl was deep and terrible; and I saw
too plainly that if he relapsed into a milder tone, it
was but to deceive me as to the real state of his
mind, and induce me to grant him some indulgences&mdash;if
not his freedom. I visited him again on the following
night; and he spoke less savagely, and more
meekly: but I mistrusted him&mdash;yes, I mistrusted
him, and I fear with good grounds. I cannot give
you a very satisfactory description of our subsequent
meetings. At one moment he has appeared touched
by my language, and has even expressed penitence
and contrition for the past: at the next moment, he
has exhibited all the natural ferocity of his disposition.
Sometimes he has assumed a coaxing manner,
and has endeavoured to move me to grant him a
light;&mdash;but I have hitherto refused. One thing I
must not forget to mention&mdash;which is that never
since the first visit I paid him has he once alluded
to the impression made upon him by the sounds of
my voice; and never has he again addressed me as
Lord Ellingham. In moments of excitement or
rage, he has demanded in a wild and almost frantic
tone who I am: but seldom waiting for the reply,
he has relapsed either into a humour of stubborn
taciturnity, or of a meekness which I knew to be
assumed. Indeed, there are many points in his character
and conduct, since he has been an inmate of
the dungeon, which I cannot comprehend. It is
however certain that darkness has not produced on
him the same rapid and important effects as upon
the other five: something more severe in the shape
of punishment, or something better calculated to
touch his heart and appeal to his feelings, is requisite.
At the same time, I believe him to be already
moved and shaken in his obduracy to a certain degree:
but reformation in respect to him must be a
work of time.”</p>

<p>“On the whole, you have hopes?” said the physician,
interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;when I call to memory all the particulars
of his conduct and language from the first occasion
of my visits until the last, which took place yesterday,
I can recognise a change,” answered the Black.
“Indeed, I am almost convinced that if it were possible
for me to speak to him at very great length&mdash;to
argue with him on the folly and wickedness of
his past life&mdash;to reason with him unrestrainedly, I
should be able to move him deeply. But the necessity
of maintaining an assumed tone, and the impossibility
of taking a light with me so as to watch
the chantings and workings of his countenance and
follow up those appeals or those arguments which
appear to have most effect with him,&mdash;in a word,
the disguise I am compelled to sustain and the precautions
I am forced to adopt, militate considerably
against my system in respect to <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>“It would be imprudent for <em>me</em> to visit him on
your behalf,” observed the physician. “On that
memorable night when Lord Ellingham had him,
Tidmarsh, and Mrs. Bunce in his power in an adjacent
room, and wrested from them all the secrets of their
damnable plots and schemes,&mdash;on that occasion, you
know, I was present; and Old Death would therefore
cherish only rancorous feelings with regard to
me.”</p>

<p>“True,” said the Black, musing: then, suddenly
starting from a deep reverie of a few minutes, he
exclaimed, “Doctor, I have thought of a plan which
I hope and trust, for the honour of human nature,
may prove efficacious in respect to that obdurate
sinner: but I hesitate&mdash;yes, I hesitate to put it
into execution!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>“Explain yourself, my dear friend,” replied Lascelles;
“and I will give you my advice candidly and
frankly.”</p>

<p>“In a word, then, doctor,” continued the Blackamoor,
“I have such faith in the soft persuasion of
woman, that I am half inclined to conjure Esther
de Medina to assist me in this good work. Would
she but consent to visit this great sinner&mdash;or rather
to address him through the sliding-panel of his
dungeon door, I am certain that her eloquence,
aided by the musical tones of her voice and the
deep feeling which would characterise her language,&mdash;I
am certain, I say, that she would succeed in
touching a chord in his heart, which no words&mdash;no
appeal of mine can reach.”</p>

<p>The physician heard with attention, and began to
reflect profoundly.</p>

<p>“For my part,” continued the Blackamoor, “I
believe that the eloquence of woman, when rightly
used and properly directed, is endowed with an influence
and a power almost irresistible. Woman’s
mission is to tame and humanize the ferocity of
man’s disposition; and the more antagonistic are
the characters of two beings of opposite sexes thus to
be brought in contact with each other, the better for
the purpose. Now, decidedly no two living creatures
can be more dissimilar in all respects than Benjamin
Bones and Esther de Medina,&mdash;the former so savage
and unrelenting; the latter so mild and forgiving,&mdash;the
one possessing a soul blackened by every possible
crime; the other endowed with every virtue
that approximates the nature of woman to that of
the angel!”</p>

<p>“I like your project&mdash;I see not the least objection
to it, my dear friend,” said Dr. Lascelles, after
a long pause, during which he pondered deeply on
the plan suggested. “Do you think that Miss de Medina
would consent to aid you in this matter?”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it,” returned the Black.
“You perceive that the dilemma is somewhat
serious, and not slightly embarrassing. I cannot
allow Benjamin Bones to go forth again into the
world, to recommence his vile intrigues: besides,
to give him his liberty thus, would be to defeat the
primary object which I had in view in breaking up
his gang. To release him at present is therefore
impossible; and I scarcely feel myself justified in
keeping him locked up much longer in a dark dungeon.
It would be unsafe to remove him into one
of the apartments of either this house or that in
Turnmill Street; for such a crafty fox can alone be
kept secure by massive stone walls and iron bolts.
What, then, am I to do with him?&mdash;how am I to
dispose of him? Esther will assist me in this difficulty;
and God send that through her agency, some
salutary impression may be made upon Old Death’s
mind!”</p>

<p>“Bear in memory,” exclaimed the physician, an
idea suddenly striking him, “that one of this man’s
horrible schemes was to avenge himself on Lord
Ellingham by torturing Esther de Medina.”</p>

<p>“And when he hears her sweet voice revealing to
him her knowledge of his atrocious designs, and
sincerely promising him her pardon,&mdash;when he
discovers how much virtue and goodness there is in
woman,” continued the Black, in an impassioned
tone, “he will be moved&mdash;he will be led to contemplate
the blackness of his own heart&mdash;he will
find himself placed in such frightful contrast with
that forgiving angel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes!” cried the physician, emphatically:
“it must be done! You have devised the only
means to produce a real and effectual impression
on that bad man’s heart; and if he prove inaccessible
to the persuasiveness of Esther’s tongue, his
case may be looked upon as hopeless.”</p>

<p>The deep-toned bell of Clerkenwell church now
struck the hour of eleven; and scarcely had the
sound died away in the silence of night, when a
post-chaise drove up to the door of the house.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bunce is now about to take her departure,”
said the Black. “Everything is prepared in
that respect&mdash;Harding and his wife have already
received full instructions and the necessary funds&mdash;and
the sooner that the woman is safe out of this
mighty city of temptation, the better.”</p>

<p>The sounds of several footsteps were now heard
descending the stairs; and a minute afterwards,
the post-chaise drove rapidly away from the house.</p>

<p>“Of all my prisoners, Old Death alone remains to
be disposed of,” observed the Black, as soon as the
din of the wheels was no longer audible.</p>

<p>“And it is to be hoped that <em>he</em> will not be a
source of difficulty or embarrassment to you for
many weeks more,” said the physician, rising to take
his departure.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXIII">CHAPTER CXIII.<br />

<span class="medium">ESTHER DE MEDINA AND OLD DEATH.</span></h2>

<p>It was on the third day after the explanations given
to Dr. Lascelles, and between five and six o’clock in
the evening, that Esther de Medina was conducted
by the Blackamoor into the subterranean passage,
the latter holding a lamp in his hand.</p>

<p>“Shall I remain near you, Esther?” he enquired,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it is not necessary,” she answered. “I am
not afraid of being in this place, gloomy as it appears;
and since I am merely to address the miserable
man through the trap-door of his dungeon, no
harm can reach me.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she turned and received the light
from her companion,&mdash;her manner being calm and
even resolute, though her countenance was very
pale.</p>

<p>“God bless you, Esther!” said the Black, emphatically:
“your willingness to aid me in this important
matter is not the least admirable trait in
your character!”</p>

<p>“It is a duty&mdash;though a painful one,” responded
the beautiful Jewess. “And now leave me&mdash;I
would rather proceed alone to the prisoner’s cell.”</p>

<p>“Remember,” said the Blackamoor, “it is the last
on the right hand side of this long subterranean
passage.”</p>

<p>He then retraced his way up the stone-staircase
communicating with the house in Red Lion Street,
while Esther advanced along the gloomy cavern,
in which the lamp shone but with feeble lustre.</p>

<p>In less than a minute she reached the door of
Old Death’s dungeon: and there she paused for
nearly another minute, a sensation of loathing and
horror preventing her from immediately announcing
her presence to the terrible inmate of that cell.
For the Black, in order to prepare her as fully and
completely as possible for her philanthropic mission,
had been compelled to reveal to her all the details
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
of those dreadful designs which Benjamin Bones
had cherished against herself and Lady Hatfield,
and which had been made known through the medium
of John Jeffreys. It was therefore natural
that Esther de Medina should shrink from the bare
idea of holding the slightest communication with a
miscreant of so ferocious a character: but a short&mdash;a
very short interval of reflection was soon sufficient
to arm her with the courage necessary to
support the ordeal.</p>

<p>Drawing back the sliding-panel which covered
the small aperture in the upper part of the massive
door, she said in her soft, musical voice, “Prisoner,
will you grant me your attention for a few minutes?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Old Death, starting
as if from a lethargic state&mdash;a movement that was
indicated by the sudden rustling of his garments
and the creaking of the bed whereon he was placed.</p>

<p>“I am Esther de Medina,” was the answer; and
the beautiful Jewess allowed the lamp to cast its
light upon her countenance, which was so close to
the aperture that Old Death caught a momentary
but perfect view of her features.</p>

<p>She then placed the lamp upon the ground, thus
again leaving the interior of the cell in complete
darkness.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it is Miss Esther de Medina!” exclaimed
Benjamin Bones, in a voice which he endeavoured to
render as mild and conciliatory as possible. “Dear
young lady, open the door, and let me out of this
horrible place. I am sure you possess a good
heart&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A heart good enough to forgive you for the
dreadful atrocity which you contemplated against
me upwards of two months ago,” interrupted
Esther, scarcely able to subdue a shuddering sensation
which came over her. “Yes&mdash;I know every
thing,” she continued: “you would have entrapped
me into your power&mdash;you would have deprived me
of the blessing of sight,&mdash;and yet I never, never injured
you.”</p>

<p>“But you say that you forgive me!” cried Old
Death, impatiently. “Open the door, then, my
sweet young lady&mdash;and I will find means to reward
you well. Listen,” he exclaimed, approaching the
trap, and speaking in a confidential kind of hollow,
murmuring whisper,&mdash;“don’t be offended at what
I am going to say&mdash;but I know that you are fond of
jewellery&mdash;and it is natural for such a beautiful
creature as you are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence, sir!” interrupted Esther, indignantly.
“I am well aware to what you allude; and it is
time to undeceive you on that head,” she added, in
a proud tone: “indeed, there is no longer any necessity
for concealment in that respect! In my turn I desire
you to listen&mdash;and listen attentively. You entertain
a belief so prejudicial to my character, that I cannot
allow even such an one as <em>you</em> to cherish it another
minute. Know, then, that I have a sister so like
myself in outward appearance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By Satan! it must be so,” ejaculated Old Death,
a light breaking in upon his mind as in a single
moment he took a rapid survey of all the circumstances
which had originally led him to suppose
that Esther was the thief of Mr. Gordon’s diamonds
and the mistress of Tom Rain. “Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I understand
it all now!” he added, in a tone that appeared
to imply vexation at his former blindness in
respect to these matters.</p>

<p>“With pain and sorrow am I thus compelled to
allude to a sister who is so dear&mdash;so very dear to
me,” resumed Esther: “but this explanation was
necessary&mdash;not only for my own sake, but likewise
to convince you of the folly and wickedness of
endeavouring to induce <em>me</em>, by the promise of reward
or bribe, to draw back the bolts of your prison-door.
No&mdash;my visit to you is inspired by the earnest
desire to move your soul to the contemplation of all
the dreadful deeds which have marked your life&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you will not set me free?” exclaimed Old
Death, in a tone of subdued rage and latent ferocity.</p>

<p>“Not now&mdash;not now,” repeated Esther. “But
listen to me attentively!”</p>

<p>“Go on,” growled the inmate of the dungeon, as
he retreated from the door, and threw himself upon
his bed again.</p>

<p>“If you entertain the slightest hope that you will
ever be allowed an opportunity to re-enter on a
course of wickedness and crime, you are sadly mistaken,”
continued Esther, speaking in a conciliatory
and yet energetic tone. “Even were you liberated
this moment, measures would be adopted to render
you completely powerless for the future in respect
to the perpetration of fresh enormities. Reflect,
then, whether it will not be better for you to devote
the remainder of your days&mdash;and in the ordinary
course of nature they must necessarily be few&mdash;to
the important duty of making your peace with
heaven! Do not despair of pardon&mdash;oh! no&mdash;do
not despair! You see that I, who am a mortal
being, can forgive you for the wrongs you meditated
against me,&mdash;and surely the mercy of heaven is
greater than that of human creatures! Yes&mdash;repent
ere it be too late; and God will not cast you off
eternally. <em>His</em> mercy is infinite: <em>His</em> pardon is never
asked in vain by the penitent sinner.”</p>

<p>“Continue to speak to me thus,” cried Old Death,
in a tone strangely subdued and wondrously meek,
considering the ferocious excitement which so lately
animated him.</p>

<p>“Oh! I sincerely hope that you will recognise the
error of your ways, ere it be indeed too late!” exclaimed
Esther, in a tone of enthusiasm deeply felt
by her generous soul. “Consider your advanced
age&mdash;and think how soon the hand of Death may be
laid upon you! Then how wretched&mdash;how awful
would your feelings be,&mdash;and how would you shudder
at the idea of being about to stand in the presence
of that Almighty Power whose laws and mandates
you have so often violated! For, after all, what
have you gained by your long, long career of wickedness?
All your treasures were annihilated in one
hour&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” interrupted Old Death, in a voice
half suffocated with emotions which the Jewess
fondly believed to be those of remorse.</p>

<p>“The hoardings of many years and the produce
of innumerable misdeeds were thus swept away,”
she continued, impressively; “and Providence at
length decreed that you should become a prisoner
in the very place where you had so long ruled as a
master. Does not heaven, then, afford you solemn
and significant warnings that your career of crime
is no more to be pursued with success?&mdash;and do not
those warnings move your heart to repentance and
remorse? Neglect not such warnings as these, I
conjure you!”</p>

<p>“Your words do me good, young lady!” exclaimed
Old Death. “I am glad that you have come
thus to speak to me.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>“And shall you ponder upon what I have said?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes. But you will not leave me yet?&mdash;and you
will come again?” he said, in a voice indicative of
suspense and anxiety relative to the answer that
was to be given.</p>

<p>“I will return to-morrow,” observed Esther.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” exclaimed Old Death, his tone
now denoting a profound emotion.</p>

<p>But Esther did not immediately leave the vicinity of
the cell on the present occasion. Believing that she
had succeeded in making some salutary impression
upon him, she was desirous of following up the promising
commencement of her mission; and she accordingly
continued to reason with him for nearly half-an-hour
longer. In the course of the observations and
arguments which she addressed to the ancient sinner,
she displayed a sound judgment and a deep but
enlightened religious feeling: there was nothing
bigoted&mdash;nothing fanatical in her language. She
indulged in no quotations from the Old Testament&mdash;the
book that formed the basis of her own nation’s
creed: but she expatiated on the goodness of the
Creator&mdash;the hope that exists for penitent sinners&mdash;the
terrors of a death-bed without previous repentance&mdash;and
the folly, as well as the wickedness, of
the course already pursued by the prisoner. Old
Death interrupted her but seldom; and when he
did interject an observation, it was in a tone and of
a nature calculated to inspire the charming Jewess
with the hope that her mission had not been undertaken
in vain.</p>

<p>At length she quitted the vicinity of the cell,
having reiterated her promise to return on the following
day.</p>

<p>And this pledge was faithfully kept;&mdash;and again
do we find the Hebrew maiden persevering in her
humane&mdash;her noble task of awakening proper feelings
in the breast of a terrible sinner. To her question
whether he had meditated upon his spiritual
condition, Old Death replied earnestly and eagerly
in the affirmative; and throughout this second visit,
he not only sought to retain the young lady near
him&mdash;or rather at his door&mdash;as long as possible, but
likewise seemed sincere in his endeavours to inspire
her with the belief that her reasoning and her
representations had not been thrown away upon
him.</p>

<p>On the third day, Esther fancied that there was
even a still more striking change in his language
when he responded to her questions or her remarks;
and not once, during the hour that she remained
standing outside his dungeon, addressing him in a
style of fervid eloquence which came from her very
heart,&mdash;not once, we say, did he give the least sign
of that ferocity and savage impatience which characterised
his behaviour on the first occasion of her
visit.</p>

<p>For a fortnight did the Hebrew maiden continue
her visits regularly, without however venturing to
enter the dungeon. On the fifteenth day she found
the prisoner anxiously expecting her arrival as
usual; and almost immediately after she had drawn
aside the panel and announced her presence, he
said, “Oh! dear young lady, I am so glad you are
come! I have been thinking so much&mdash;so very
much over all you have lately told me; and I have
felt comforted by repeating to myself the arguments
you advance urging me to repentance. Ah! Miss,
I have been a dreadful sinner&mdash;a dreadful sinner;
and I see that I am righteously punished. But
though I am penitent, you have no confidence in me
yet&mdash;and that gives me pain. Yon are afraid to
trust yourself with me! Do you think that I would
harm you?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” replied Esther; “and you shall not
much longer have to accuse me of want of confidence
in you. I am pleased to observe that you at
length <em>feel</em> how shocking it is to become an object of
mistrust and suspicion.”</p>

<p>“You are an angel, young lady!” exclaimed Benjamin
Bones, approaching the door on the outer side
of which stood the Hebrew maiden. “No one on
earth save yourself could have made such an impression
upon my mind, and in so short a time. But
will you promise me one thing?”</p>

<p>“Name your request,” said Esther.</p>

<p>“That you will not send any man to converse
with me,” answered Old Death. “You are of the
gentle sex&mdash;and that is why your sweet voice has
had such power and influence with me. Had that
gentleman&mdash;whoever he is&mdash;continued to visit me,
he would have done no good. I suspect my own
sex:&mdash;I do not think that men can be so sincere&mdash;so
conscientious&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The gentleman to whom you allude will not visit
you again without your consent,” interrupted Esther.
“I have undertaken this mission, and will
fulfil it to the utmost of my ability. I have now
something important to communicate,&mdash;important
indeed, I should imagine, to one who has been so
long in darkness. In a word, I intend to give you
a lamp&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! excellent young lady!” cried Benjamin
Bones, in a voice expressive of the most unfeigned
joy. “Make haste and open the door&mdash;give me the
light&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;I must not manifest too much confidence,
in you all at once. See what it is to have been so long
the votary of crime and wickedness&mdash;you inspire a
mistrust which cannot be dissipated in a moment.”</p>

<p>“What can I do to convince you of my penitence&mdash;my
gratitude?” demanded Old Death, in an earnest&mdash;anxious
tone.</p>

<p>“Leave me to judge for myself relative to your
state of mind,” said Esther. “You perceive that I
already begin to entertain hopes concerning you:
the proof is that I now give you a lamp&mdash;and a book
also, if you have a sincere inclination to examine its
pages.”</p>

<p>As she uttered these words, Esther unfastened
the grating which covered the aperture, and passed
the lamp through to Old Death&mdash;then the volume
to which she had alluded.</p>

<p>The light flashed upon his countenance as he received
the lamp; and it struck Esther that there
was something hideous even in the expression of
joy which now animated those repulsive features:&mdash;but
she knew that looks which had grown sinister
and become stamped with ferocious menace during
the lapse of many, many years, could not be changed
nor improved in a moment, however great were the
moral reformation that had taken place within.</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear young lady&mdash;a thousand thanks!”
exclaimed Old Death, as he placed the lamp upon
the table: then, after a few minutes’ pause, during
which he looked into the book, he said in a tone of
surprise, “But you have brought me a Bible containing
the New as well as the Old Testament&mdash;and
yet yourself only believe in the latter?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>“I respect the religion of the Christian, although
I have been taught to put no faith in it,” answered
Esther de Medina, in a modest and subdued tone.
“But I must now depart: and to-morrow I shall
visit you again.”</p>

<p>Esther withdrew, in the firm belief that a most
salutary impression had been made upon the mind
of one of the greatest criminals of modern times.
Her report was received with the most heart-felt
joy by the Blackamoor; and he was enthusiastic in
his expressions of gratitude towards the beautiful
maiden for her exertions in what may unaffectedly
be denominated “a good cause.”</p>

<p>“Do you return to Finchley Manor with me this
evening?” she asked, cutting short his compliments
with a good-humoured smile.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I have particular business to attend to,
Esther,” he replied. “But you may tell a certain
young lady,” he added, now smiling in his turn,
“that I shall be sure to see her to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” repeated Esther. “You forget&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! I did indeed forget,” interrupted the Black.
“To-morrow is the day on which Arthur returns to
town; and I must not risk a visit to the Manor.
The fortnight of his absence has soon expired, methinks:
but doubtless in that time he has made all
the necessary preparation to render his country seat
in Kent fitting and comfortable to receive his bride,”
observed the Black, smiling again. “Nay&mdash;do not
blush, Esther: he is a noble fellow, and well deserving
of all your love! And, by the bye, this absence
on his part has proved most serviceable in one
sense,” he continued, again assuming a serious tone:
“for had he remained in town, you never would
have been able to devote the time you have given
each day to the reformation of that wretched man
below.”</p>

<p>“To speak candidly,” observed Esther, “I foresee
a considerable difficulty relative to my future
visits to the unhappy prisoner: but I feared to mention
my embarrassment in this respect&mdash;I fancied
that you might suppose me to be wearied of the
task I had undertaken&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know you too well to entertain such an injurious
suspicion,” interrupted the Black, hastily
and emphatically. “But it is natural, now that
Arthur and yourself are so shortly to be united,
that he should seek your society as often and for as
long a period each day as circumstances will permit&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” observed Esther, with a modest blush:
“and though his welfare is so deeply interested in
our present enterprise&mdash;though, in a word, so many
grave and important interests depend upon the
success of our endeavours to humanize and reform
that wretched prisoner, and disarm him for the
future&mdash;still I could not stoop to any falsehood or
subterfuge to account to the Earl of Ellingham for
my daily absence from home for several hours. It
is true that my father is in the secret of our proceedings&mdash;that
he even approved of the course which
you suggested, and which I have adopted&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stay! an idea strikes me!” suddenly ejaculated
the Black. “You told me ere now that Benjamin
Bones implored you to continue your visits to him,
and not allow me to take your place; and from this
circumstance we have both drawn favourable auguries
relative to his ultimate and complete repentance.
He already looks upon you as his guardian angel&mdash;the
means of his salvation; and it would be perhaps
productive of evil results&mdash;it might even lead to a
moral reaction on his part&mdash;were he to believe that
you had deserted him. You have so well prepared
the way in the grand work of reformation with regard
to this man, that <em>another</em> might now undertake
<em>your</em> duties&mdash;and Benjamin Bones would still
continue to believe that it is the same Esther de
Medina who visits him.”</p>

<p>“I understand you,” said the Hebrew maiden,
evidently rejoiced at a suggestion which relieved her
mind from the fear of a serious difficulty. “But
would <em>you</em> be satisfied with such an arrangement?”</p>

<p>“I see no alternative,” replied the Black. “Arthur
will call daily at Finchley Manor&mdash;and your frequent
absence would, to say the least of it, appear
strange.”</p>

<p>“Oh! wherefore not allow Arthur at once to be
made acquainted with the whole truth?” demanded
Esther, in an earnest and appealing manner.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;that may not be!” exclaimed the
Blackamoor. “My projects must first be carried
out to the very end: for it would be my pride and
my triumph, when all danger shall have passed
away, to say to him, ‘<em>Arthur, you were surrounded
by perils which you did not suspect: demons were
plotting every kind of atrocity against your peace;&mdash;and
I have annihilated all their schemes, and tamed
the schemers themselves!</em>’ Urge me not therefore,
my dear Esther, to deviate from the course which I
have chalked out for myself, and which I consider
to be to some extent an atonement for the misdeeds
of my own life. Yes&mdash;for he who accomplishes a
great good, assuredly expiates a great amount of
evil.”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, recur not to the past!” murmured
the beautiful Jewess, turning pale and shuddering
at the crowd of unpleasant&mdash;nay awful reminiscences
which her companion’s language recalled
to her mind.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;let us deliberate only for the present,”
exclaimed the Black; “and the more I think of the
plan which I have suggested, the more suitable
does it appear. Yes,” he continued, “this is the
only alternative. Let <em>your</em> visits to Benjamin Bones
cease, Esther&mdash;and yet let him still continue to
believe that he is not neglected nor deserted by
Miss de Medina. I need say no more: the rest lies
with you.”</p>

<p>“I understand you,” returned the Hebrew maiden;
“and it shall be as you desire.”</p>

<p>She then took her departure.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXIV">CHAPTER CXIV.<br />

<span class="medium">OLD DEATH IN THE DUNGEON.</span></h2>

<p>It was five o’clock in the evening of the following
day; and Old Death was crouched up, like a wild
beast, upon his bed in the dungeon, which was now
lighted by the lamp that Esther de Medina had
given him.</p>

<p>His natural emaciation had so frightfully increased,
that he seemed but a skeleton in the clothes which
hung upon him as if they had never been made for
one so thin as he. The skirts of his old grey coat
were wrapped around his wasted shanks&mdash;for, though
it was now the month of May, yet it was cold in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
dungeon. His countenance was wan and ghastly;&mdash;but
its expression was little calculated to excite
pity&mdash;for any thing more diabolically ferocious than
the old miscreant’s aspect, cannot be well conceived.
His face was the horrible reflex of a mind filled
with passions and longings of so savage and inhuman
a nature, that the mere thought makes one
shudder.</p>

<p>“She will come presently,” he muttered to himself,
with a kind of subdued growling which indicated
the fury of his pent-up rage: “she will come
presently,” he repeated, his eyes glaring like those
of a hyena beneath his shaggy, over-hanging brows;
“and perhaps it will be for to-day! Who knows?
she may think me penitent enough to be no longer
dangerous: and then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused, and ground his jaws savagely together
as if they were filled with teeth; and his hands were
clenched with such spasmodic violence that the long
nails ran into the palms.</p>

<p>“For two months and a half,” he continued at
length, and still musing to himself, “has the fiend&mdash;the
infernal wretch&mdash;my mortal enemy, kept me
here! For two months and a half have I been his
prisoner! Perdition seize upon him! That man
was sent into the world to be my ruin&mdash;to thwart
me&mdash;to persecute me! From the first moment I
ever met him six or seven months ago, all has gone
wrong with me. But the day of vengeance must
and shall come,&mdash;yes&mdash;vengeance&mdash;vengeance&mdash;though
it costs me my life. Ah! he fancies that I
am ignorant of his secret: and yet I understand it
all now&mdash;yes&mdash;all, all! Rapid as was the gleam of
the lamp which showed me his features the first time
he ever visited me here, so quick did a light flash to
my mind&mdash;so quick did the truth break upon me!
Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I understand it all <em>now</em>;”&mdash;and he
chuckled in a scarcely audible manner, yet the more
horribly menacing because it was so subdued and
low. “But how can it be?&mdash;how could he have
been saved?” he asked himself, in his sombre musings:
then, after a brief pause, during which he
rocked to and fro on the bed, he continued, “Never
mind the <em>how</em>! That such is the fact I am confident&mdash;and
that is enough for me! Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;that is
enough for me! Fool that I was ever for a moment
to suspect him to be Lord Ellingham! And yet I
should have clung to this belief, had not the lamp
glared upon his face as he darted out of the cell!
Ah! ah! he little thinks that I know him now&mdash;that
I have known him ever since the moment when
the light showed me his features, blackened as they
were! Ah! ah!” again chuckled Old Death: “I
fancy that I have lulled them into an idea of my
penitence! They imagine that the work of reformation
has begun with me! Ah! ha! I played my
cards well there! I did not whine and weep too
soon&mdash;I appeared to be precious tough, and precious
obstinate; and my slow conversion seemed all the
more natural. They will fall all the easier into the
snare: they&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this moment a slight noise at the door of the
cell made the ancient miscreant start; and he instantaneously
composed his features into as mournful
and sanctimonious an expression as such a horribly
hang-dog countenance could possibly assume.</p>

<p>The trap-door opened; and a sweet, musical voice
said, “I am here again, according to my promise:
you see that I do not desert you.”</p>

<p>“Ah my dear young lady,” cried Old Death, affecting
a tremulous tone, “you are too good to such a
dreadful sinner as I have been! My God! when I
think of all the atrocity that I once planned against
you, I feel inclined to implore you to depart from
even the vicinity of such a wretch as me!”</p>

<p>“Have you not been already assured that you are
fully and completely forgiven in reference to the wickedness
to which you allude?” demanded the young
lady, whose beautiful countenance was now plainly
visible to Old Death through the grating over the
aperture in the door.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss de Medina,” returned the wretch, assuming
a still more penitent tone; “but I cannot
forgive myself. You are an angel, dear young lady&mdash;and
I am a demon. I know I am! All last night
I endeavoured to read the Bible that you gave me
yesterday: but I cannot settle my mind to the task.
I want some one to read it to me&mdash;if only for half
an hour every day. But this cannot be&mdash;I am aware
it cannot! You&mdash;the only person living that could
have made such an impression upon me&mdash;are afraid
to enter my cell. You told me so yesterday. But
am I not a human being?&mdash;am I a wild beast? Ah!
dear young lady&mdash;I could not injure you!”&mdash;and the
old miscreant appeared to weep.</p>

<p>“Do you think it would console you if I were to
place confidence in you&mdash;enter your cell&mdash;and read
you a portion of the Word of God?”</p>

<p>“Why do you tantalize an old, old man who is
miserable enough as it is?” asked Old Death, in return
to this question. “Do you suppose that I am
not weighed down to the very dust by an awful
load of crime? If you are afraid to come into the
cell, send me a clergyman. But, no&mdash;no,” he added,
as if yielding to the sudden influence of a second
thought: “I will pray with no one but yourself!
You have been my good angel&mdash;you first touched
my heart. I must wait till you have sufficient confidence
in me to follow up the blessed work you
have already begun so well. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;even if I
must remain here for a whole year, I will not
receive consolation from any one but you!”</p>

<p>“If I only thought that you were so far advanced
in the path of penitence&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Can you doubt it?” hastily demanded the prisoner.
“Have you such little confidence in your
own powers of persuasion? Oh! my dear young
lady,” continued the wretch, falling upon his knees
on the floor of the cell, and joining his hands
together, “have pity upon me&mdash;have pity upon me!
Your mistrust of me pierces like a dagger to my
heart. I crave&mdash;I long to be able to show you my
gratitude;&mdash;and that can only be by proving my
contrition. Dear young lady, have mercy on an old,
old man, who would embrace the very ground on
which you tread!”</p>

<p>“It would be wicked&mdash;it would be a crime to refuse
your demand,” said the sweet, musical voice,
now tremulous with emotion, of her whom the
demon-hearted hypocrite called his good angel.
“Stay&mdash;I will fetch the key&mdash;and on my return I
will read the Bible to you.”</p>

<p>And the Hebrew lady hurried away from the
vicinity of the dungeon; and, having ascended the
spiral stone staircase with rapid steps, entered the
apartment usually inhabited by the Blackamoor.
But he was not there: and she paused&mdash;uncertain
how to act; for she now remembered that he had
gone out for a short time immediately after giving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
her certain instructions relative to the conduct she
was to maintain towards Old Death.</p>

<div id="i_017" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I should not like to do this without his consent,”
she murmured to herself: “and yet the
prisoner is so penitent&mdash;so contrite, that it would
be a sin&mdash;nay, a crime, not to confirm the salutary
impression which is now so strong upon him. Yes&mdash;yes,”
she continued: “I will take this step upon
my own responsibility! Surely <em>he</em> will not blame
me for thus exceeding his instructions, when the
cause is so good and the need seems so urgent!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she took down a large key from a
nail inside a cupboard, and retraced her way to the
subterranean.</p>

<p>In the meantime&mdash;during the ten minutes which
her absence lasted&mdash;Old Death was agitated by a
thousand conflicting thoughts. At one moment an
infernal joy filled his heart, and he rubbed his hands
together in horrible and fiend-like glee: at the next
instant his countenance became convulsed with the
hideous workings of his fears lest something should
occur to prevent the Jewess from entering his cell.
He seemed to live an age in that ten minutes; and
he felt that if the terrific excitement which he thus
endured, were to last for an hour, it would crush
and overwhelm him. All the worst passions of his
diabolical nature were set in motion like the waves
of the sea: and in that short space of time were
awakened feelings which, for intensity of awful
spite and inveterate malignity, were probably never
before nor since paralleled in the breast of man!</p>

<p>At length there was a slight rustling of a silk dress
and the sound of a gentle though hasty tread in the
passage without; and in a few moments the beautiful
countenance of the Jewess appeared at the grated
aperture.</p>

<p>“Blessed young lady!” exclaimed Old Death, suddenly
exercising an immense mastery over his ferocious
passions, and assuming a tone of mingled
gratitude and hope.</p>

<p>“Heaven grant that the step which I am now
taking may have a permanently beneficial effect!”
said the Jewess, in a voice profoundly sincere, as she
placed the key in the lock.</p>

<p>Then, with her gentle hands, she drew back the
massive bolts; and in another moment she entered
the dungeon in which the greatest miscreant that
ever disgraced human nature was crouched upon
the bed, like a tiger ready to spring from its lair.</p>

<p>For upwards of a minute this dreadful man could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
scarcely believe his eyes&mdash;could scarcely credit his own
senses. Was it possible that she was there&mdash;there, in
his presence&mdash;there, in his power? It appeared to be
a dream; and a momentary dizziness seized upon him.</p>

<p>“Give me the Bible,” said the Jewess, taking the
chair; “and do you draw near me.”</p>

<p>“Here is the book,” observed Old Death, in a deep
tone which might well be mistaken for the sign of
solemn feelings, and was indeed so interpreted.</p>

<p>The lady placed the sacred volume upon the table
before her, and began to turn over its leaves in order
to find the passage which she deemed most appropriate
and suitable for the circumstances of the occasion.
Having discovered the chapter which she sought,
she raised her eyes towards Old Death’s countenance
in order to assure herself that he was in readiness for
her to begin; but a sudden sensation of horror and
apprehension seized upon her, as she caught a glimpse
of the diabolical expression of those features on which
the pale light of the flickering lamp fell with sinister
effect.</p>

<p>Then, with a howl of ferocious rage, that old man,
whom the deep craving after a bloody vengeance now
rendered as strong as a giant,&mdash;that old man precipitated
himself upon the terrified Jewess with all the
fury of a ravenous monster, the chair broke down
beneath the shock; and with dreadful shrieks and
appalling screams the Hebrew lady fell upon the
dungeon-floor, held tight in the grasp of the miscreant,
who was uppermost.</p>

<p>In another instant those shrieks and screams yielded
to subdued moans; for his fingers had fixed themselves
round her throat like an iron vice. Desperate&mdash;desperate
were her struggles,&mdash;the struggles of the agony of
death: but Benjamin Bones seemed to gather energy
and force from the mere act of this strong resistance;&mdash;and
as his grasp tightened round his victim’s neck,
low but savage growls escaped his lips.</p>

<p>By degrees the struggling grew less violent&mdash;and a
gurgling sound succeeded the moans of the Jewish
lady. Tighter&mdash;and more tightly still were pressed
the demon’s fingers, until his long nails entered her
soft and palpitating flesh. Oh! it was horrible&mdash;horrible,&mdash;this
scene of ruthless murder in that subterranean
dungeon!</p>

<p>At length the movements of the victim became
mere convulsive spasms: but her large dark eyes,
now unnaturally brilliant, glared up at Old Death,
fixedly and appallingly. Nevertheless, he was not
terrified&mdash;he was not stricken with remorse! No&mdash;still,
still he clung to his victim, his own eyes looking
down ferociously into hers, and the workings of his
countenance displaying a fiend-like triumph&mdash;a
savage glory in the awful deed which he was perpetrating.</p>

<p>Nearly five minutes had elapsed from the instant
when the murderer first sprang upon the unfortunate
Jewess: and now, suddenly starting to his feet, he
seized the lamp and dashed it upon her head. A low
moan escaped her&mdash;and all was silent.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;all was silent, and all was darkness too; for
the light had been extinguished:&mdash;and Old Death
precipitated himself from the dungeon.</p>

<p>He hurried along the subterranean, which he knew
so well,&mdash;hurried along towards the spiral stair-case,
wondering whether he should be enabled to effect his
escape, yet almost reckless and desperate as to what
might become of him, now that his savage vengeance
was accomplished.</p>

<p>He ascended the stone steps&mdash;he entered the room
which had for years and years served him as a bed-chamber,
before he had been compelled to dispose of
the house to Lord Ellingham. He passed into the laboratory:
and as yet he had proceeded without interruption.
Joy! joy! he should escape yet&mdash;the adjoining
room, now fitted up as a handsome parlour, was
likewise untenanted at the moment:&mdash;joy! joy! he is
descending the stair-case leading to the hall!</p>

<p>Is it possible that he will escape? Fortune seems
to favour the diabolical murderer; and his hand is now
upon the latch of the front-door&mdash;he stands as it were
once more upon the threshold of that great world
which is so wide and has so many channels for the
machinations of the wicked! The house seems deserted&mdash;not
a questioning voice falls upon his ear,&mdash;not
the step of a human foot, save his own, interrupts
the silence of the place! Yes&mdash;it appears as if escape
be now a certainty,&mdash;escape for him who dared not
hope for it, and did not even think of it, when intent
on the all-absorbing scheme of his vengeance!</p>

<p>And now the front-door opens to his touch: but&mdash;ah!
he has blood upon his hands&mdash;the blood that had
flowed from the neck of the murdered Jewess. He
starts back&mdash;he hesitates for a moment,&mdash;but only for
a moment: Old Death is not the man to remain long
uncertain how to proceed in such a strait!</p>

<p>Thrusting his hands&mdash;his gore-stained hands&mdash;into
his pockets, the demon-hearted monster issues as coolly
and calmly from the house as if it were his own and he
had nothing to fear. The fresh air of heaven&mdash;untasted
by him for ten long weeks&mdash;comes gushing upon
his face: he is free&mdash;he is free!</p>

<p>“Ah!” is the hasty ejaculation which now falls on
his ear: he looks around&mdash;a man is bounding, flying
towards him&mdash;and in another instant he is in the
grasp of the Blackamoor.</p>

<p>A short and desperate struggle takes place; and a
crowd immediately gathers near&mdash;for the Sessions are
being held at Hicks’s Hall, on Clerkenwell Green, so
that the neighbourhood presents the bustling appearance
usual on such occasions.</p>

<p>“Seize him&mdash;hold him!” yells forth Old Death, as
his powerful opponent hurls him towards the house-door,
which the miscreant had not closed behind him.</p>

<p>“He is a mad-man&mdash;escaped from a lunatic asylum!”
exclaimed the Blackamoor, horrible apprehensions
filling his soul relative to the Jewess&mdash;for his eyes had
caught sight of the blood upon Old Death’s hands.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;I am not a mad-man!” shrieked out the
latter. “Seize him&mdash;hold him, I say:&mdash;<em>he has escaped
the scaffold&mdash;he is</em> <span class="smcap">Tom Rain</span>, <em>the highwayman</em>!”</p>

<p>At that dreadful announcement the Blackamoor was
struck speechless and motionless, as if a thunderbolt
had fallen at his feet; and in the next instant he was
in the grasp of Dykes and Bingham, who, having business
at the Sessions House, happened to be amongst
the crowd gathered at the entrance of Red Lion
Street.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;seize him&mdash;hold him tight!” yelled Benjamin
Bones: “he is Tom Rain, I tell you&mdash;his face
is coloured purposely&mdash;but I knew that he is Tom
Rain!”</p>

<p>“And hold that miscreant also!” ejaculated Rainford&mdash;for
he indeed the Blackamoor was: “seize him&mdash;let
him not escape!” he cried, recovering the power
of speech, as his eyes again caught a glimpse of the
blood-stained hands of Old Death. “There has been
murder committed in this house&mdash;&mdash;My God! my
God!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>The crowd had now not only increased to such an
extent as to render the way perfectly impassable; but
a tremendous sensation suddenly seized upon the assemblage,&mdash;the
news that Tom Rain, the celebrated
highwayman, had escaped death by some miraculous
means, and was once more in custody, circulating like
wild-fire. Dykes and Bingham, knowing that in such
a case the sympathies of the mob were most likely to
turn in favour of the prisoner, hurried him and Old
Death into the house, whither they were followed by
three or four other constables; and the door was immediately
closed in the face of the crowd, and secured
within.</p>

<p>On reaching the sitting-room the first-floor, the
party halted; and Old Death, now completely overcome
by the excitement of the incidents which had so
rapidly succeeded each other in a short half-hour,
threw himself exhausted into a chair.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Rainford,” said Dykes, with something
like a malicious grin, “I am sorry for this business&mdash;but
how, in the name of all that’s wonderful, did you
escape after being so deuced well hung as I seed you
was with, my own eyes?”</p>

<p>“Silence!” ejaculated Rainford, in an imperious
tone: “and come with me at once down below. For,
as sure as you are there, murder&mdash;a horrible murder
has been committed by that wretch,” pointing to Old
Death, who now quivered beneath his furious looks;
“and, if you doubt it, behold the blood upon his
hands!” added Tom Rain, with a cold shudder.</p>

<p>“Bring him along with us, Bingham,” said Dykes,
addressing his brother officer.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;I won’t go down there again!” yelled
forth the murderer, his countenance becoming convulsed
with horror; for he was now afraid of his crime,
in the revulsion of his feelings.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;let him stay here in custody,” observed
Dykes; “and me and a couple of the runners will go
with Mr. Rainford.”</p>

<p>The officer and the two myrmidons whom he had
selected, accordingly proceeded with Tom Rain into
the room where the trap-door of the spiral stair-case
had been left open by Old Death; and the constables
surveyed each other with, mingled apprehension and
astonishment.</p>

<p>“You are not afraid?” exclaimed Rainford, in a
contemptuous tone, as he lighted a lamp: then, with
impatient excitement, he cried, “Do your duty, and
come with me. Life may still be left in her&mdash;come&mdash;come!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: we shall go along with you, sure
enough,” growled Dykes, as he led the way, followed
by Rainford&mdash;the two runners closing the rear.</p>

<p>In three minutes more the little party entered the
dungeon which had so lately been the prison-house of
Old Death: and there what a dreadful spectacle met
their eyes! The murdered lady was stretched upon
the floor&mdash;her countenance horribly discoloured and
swollen&mdash;the forehead completely smashed by the blow
inflicted by the lamp which had been dashed at her&mdash;and
her eyes staring with a stony glare, as if about to
start out of their sockets.</p>

<p>“O Tamar! Tamar! my dearest&mdash;best beloved
Tamar!” cried Tom Rain, in a tone of bitter&mdash;bitter
anguish, as he threw himself upon his knees by the
side of the corpse.</p>

<p>The officers, rude in heart, and rendered obdurate as
they were by the very nature of their profession, stood
back in respectful silence at this outburst of sorrow
from the lips of the resuscitated highwayman.</p>

<p>“My God!” murmured the unhappy man, clasping
his hands together; “who shall break these fearful
tidings to your father and your sister? And will they
not reproach me?&mdash;will they not attribute this frightful
calamity to that project of reformation which I
had devised in behalf of Benjamin Bones? O Tamar&mdash;my
dearest Tamar&mdash;who could have foreseen that
such a terrible destiny was in store for thee!”</p>

<p>And, bowing down his head, he wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Suddenly loud voices were heard from the top of
the spiral stair-case, summoning Dykes thither.</p>

<p>“Come along, sir&mdash;it is useless to remain here!”
cried the officer, speaking hastily but respectfully to
Tom Rain, who suffered himself to be led away&mdash;or
rather, he did not offer any resistance to those who
conducted him thence.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what now!” demanded Dykes, hurrying up
the steps, at the head of which his friend Bingham
was continuing to shout after him.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;don’t you know,” was the reply, “that
Government has offered a reward for the diskivery of
the chap wot carried off Sir Christopher Blunt and
Dr. Lascelles&mdash;about that there Torrens’s affair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what then?” cried Dykes, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Blowed if it ain’t Tom Rain,” responded Bingham:
“he did it&mdash;and we’ve knabbed him. So that’s a cool
two hundred and fifty a piece!”</p>

<p>“By goles!” ejaculated Dykes, his countenance expanding
into the most glorious humour possible, as if
all remembrance of the horrible scene he had just
witnessed were banished from his mind: “this is good
news, though,” he added, as he emerged from the
stair-case into the little back room with which it communicated.
“But how do you know that the chap
as kidnapped the knight and the doctor is Mr. Rainford?”</p>

<p>“Because I’ve been talking with old Ben Bones,”
answered Bingham; “and he told me as how he’d
been kidnapped too, and kept a prisoner down there
for a matter of ten weeks;&mdash;and how there was a lot
on ’em&mdash;and Josh Pedler and Tim Splint among the
rest. So, when he mentioned them names, I pricks
up my ears&mdash;and I asks him a question or two; and I
find that they was all kidnapped just at the time that
the Torrens affair was a-making sich a noise: so it’s a
clear case.”</p>

<p>“Clear enough, to be sure!” exclaimed Dykes.</p>

<p>“Ben Bones doesn’t seem to know any thing about
that affair,” continued Dykes: “cos why, he was
lugged off and took down in that there place afore the
business was made public by Sir Christopher and the
doctor. But, I say&mdash;what has happened below?”</p>

<p>“A young o’oman killed&mdash;that’s all,” answered
Dykes. “So here’s a pretty day’s business for us,
Bingham: a man that had been hung, took up fust&mdash;then
a murder diskivered, and the murderer in our
power&mdash;and now this here affair about the Government
reward. Well&mdash;we’ve been rather slack lately&mdash;and
a little okkipation’s quite a blessin’.”</p>

<p>Thus conversing together, Mr. Dykes and Mr.
Bingham returned to the apartment where Old Death
was still sitting in a chair, watched by a couple of
constables: but the moment Rainford, who had only
a confused idea, of what was passing around him, was
led into that room, he started back in horror&mdash;exclaiming,
“No&mdash;no: I cannot bear to be in the company
of this dreadful man!”</p>

<p>Old Death, to whom he pointed, grinned in savage
triumph: but Rainford had already rushed back into
the laboratory, attended by Dykes and two runners.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Almost at the same instant, the lad C&aelig;sar who had
heard from the crowd outside enough to convince him
that Rainford had been discovered, and also that a
person answering the description of Old Death had
first denounced the resuscitated highwayman, and had
then himself been arrested on a charge of murder,&mdash;C&aelig;sar,
we say, now made his appearance, and threw
himself at his master’s feet, exclaiming wildly, “Oh!
no&mdash;my generous friend&mdash;my more than father&mdash;they
shall not take you from us!”</p>

<p>“Jacob,” said Tom Rain, raising the distracted
youth, who was no other than the reader’s former acquaintance,
Jacob Smith,&mdash;“do not yield to grief.
We have need of all our courage on this occasion. I
have received a frightful blow&mdash;wounded I am in the
tenderest point&mdash;oh! I can scarcely restrain my anguish,
while conjuring you to be calm! And yet it
is necessary to meet my afflictions face to face! Hasten,
then, to Finchley&mdash;and break the sad intelligence
to Mr. de Medina and Esther: tell them, Jacob&mdash;as
gently as you can&mdash;tell them that Benjamin Bones
has crowned all his enormities by&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My God! it is then too true!” ejaculated the
youth; covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;Tamar is no more!” added Rainford, tears
gushing from his eyes. “My poor wife has been
brutally&mdash;foully murdered by that miscreant!”</p>

<p>Jacob Smith hurried away, his own heart feeling as
if it were about to break.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Tom Rain, suddenly turning towards
Dykes, “I appeal to you as men to allow me to
superintend the removal of the remains of that lady,
who was my wife, to a chamber in this house; and
then, that duty being performed, I shall be ready to
accompany you whithersoever you may choose to conduct
me.”</p>

<p>“We are not particular for an hour or so, Mr.
Rainford,” returned Dykes. “Indeed, it would be
better to let the crowd disperse a little; and if so be
you don’t mind staying here a bit, we’ll wait till dark.
The evenings is long now, you see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I should have wished to remain here until the relatives
of the deceased lady had time to arrive and
take charge of the body,” interrupted Tom Rain:
“but I dared not ask such a favour at your hands.
As it is, however, I thank you.”</p>

<p>“But you must likewise let old Ben Bones stay
here, until after dusk at least,” urged Dykes: “for if
it was knowed to the people outside that it was the
ancient fence who had killed a woman, they’d be after
tearing him to pieces. So we must smuggle him out
presently.”</p>

<p>Rainford gave his consent to the proposition: he
was too sick at heart&mdash;too profoundly overwhelmed
by misfortune, to attempt to argue any question that
might arise from the lamentable incidents of that
evening.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXV">CHAPTER CXV.<br />

<span class="medium">THOMAS RAINFORD.</span></h2>

<p>The arrest of Tom Rain and Old Death took
place at about twenty minutes to six on the evening
in question; and by ten o’clock that night the news
were circulated throughout every quarter of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The incidents involved in the double arrestation
were well adapted to produce as much excitement as
the extraordinary adventures of Sir Christopher
Blunt and Dr. Lascelles ten weeks previously.</p>

<p>In the first place, a man who had been publicly executed
at Horsemonger Lane, was now discovered to
be alive, having been doubtless resuscitated in some
extraordinary way; although the more credulous and
wonder-loving portion of the community were firmly
convinced that Tom Rain had never been hanged at
all, but that the body of some prisoner recently deceased
at the time was ushered through the dreadful
ordeal instead of the formidable highwayman.</p>

<p>In the second place, this said Thomas Rainford
was said to be the mysterious personage who, usurping
the attributes of justice, had kidnapped Dr. Lascelles
and Sir Christopher Blunt, and had somehow
or another disposed of the real murderers of Sir
Henry Courtenay, after having devised the necessary
means to prove and make public the innocence of Mr.
Torrens.</p>

<p>In the third place, a notorious fence, named Benjamin
Bones, who had defied the police and the laws
for many, many years, had at last fatally entangled
himself with justice, by committing a diabolical murder
upon the person of Thomas Rainford’s wife.</p>

<p>And, in the fourth place, it had been discovered
that there were situate two houses in the very heart
of London having a subterraneous passage connecting
them, and this subterranean communicating with several
dark and gloomy dungeons, decently furnished, and
in which half-a-dozen prisoners had recently been confined.
One of these prisoners was now known to be
Benjamin Bones; but what had become of the other
five?</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances which took the whole
town by storm, and produced a tremendous sensation
from one end of London to the other&mdash;the intelligence
reaching even Lady Hatfield, retired and secluded as
was her mode of living.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten o’clock on that eventful evening,
a private carriage drove up to the house in Red Lion
Street; and Mr. de Medina, Esther, and Lord Ellingham
alighted. Jacob Smith leapt down from the box;
and in a few moments the entire party entered the
dwelling, thus disappearing from the gaze of the assembled
crowd.</p>

<p>The Jew, his daughter, and the young nobleman
were immediately conducted by one of Rainford’s dependants
into the apartment where the unhappy husband
of the murdered Tamar was pacing up and
down, Dykes sitting in a corner watching his movements.
The prisoner was no longer disguised: during
the interval which had elapsed since his arrest, he had,
by the officer’s express desire, washed off the black
dye from his face and hands; and he now wore his
natural aspect in one sense&mdash;though, in another, his
expressive countenance was altered by the despair
that filled his soul.</p>

<p>“Oh! Thomas&mdash;what terrible afflictions have occurred!”
exclaimed Lord Ellingham, as he flew into
his half-brother’s arms.</p>

<p>“You will not reproach me, Arthur&mdash;&mdash;-Oh! do not
augment my grief!” cried Rainford: and he wept
bitter tears.</p>

<p>“No one will reproach you, excellent young man,”
said Mr. de Medina, taking the hand of his bereaved
son-in-law. “But&mdash;&mdash;Oh! my daughter&mdash;my daughter,
Tamar! Great God! thou hast chosen to afflict me
deeply&mdash;deeply!”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Esther de Medina had thrown
herself into a chair, giving way to the wildest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
paroxysms of grief&mdash;the Earl of Ellingham having
vainly accosted her with the hope of importing some
slight consolation. But, alas! he himself was a prey
to the most poignant anguish: and, even had he been
more calm, how was it possible to comfort Esther de
Medina for the loss&mdash;the cruel assassination&mdash;of that
sister whom she loved so tenderly and so well?</p>

<p>“Thomas,” at length said the Earl, approaching his
half-brother, “has Jacob Smith told us the dreadful
tale correctly?&mdash;and is it&mdash;he&mdash;Benjamin Bones&mdash;who
has done this? My God! I have scarcely been able
to comprehend all the terrible particulars!”</p>

<p>“It is true&mdash;it is too true&mdash;I know that it is!” exclaimed
Mr. de Medina, shaking his head in despair.
“Yes&mdash;Tamar is no more; but&mdash;at least&mdash;let me behold
her remains!”</p>

<p>Rainford turned an appealing glance towards Dykes,
as much as to say, “You surely will allow me to proceed
unwatched and unguarded along with these
mourners to the chamber where the corpse lies?”</p>

<p>But Dykes, who understood the meaning of that
glance, said in a respectful though firm tone, “I dare
not trust you out of my sight!”</p>

<p>“I will be answerable for him, officer!” cried the
Earl of Ellingham. “Do you know me? I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know who you are, my lord,” answered Dykes;
“but I cannot oblige you.”</p>

<p>“Is not grief such as that which you now contemplate,”
said the nobleman, indicating the weeping
father and sister of the deceased lady,&mdash;“is not such
grief as this too solemn for the intrusion of a stranger?”</p>

<p>“Since your lordship forces me to speak plain,” returned
Dykes, “Mr. Rainford is my prisoner on two
charges&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“On two charges!” ejaculated the Earl: then, remembering
all that his brother had passed through,
he said mournfully, “But, just heavens! <em>one</em> is
enough!”</p>

<p>“As your lordship observes,” began Dykes, “one
is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that moment another private carriage rattled up
to the door of the house, and a lady, alighting with
feverish impatience, was instantaneously admitted into
the dwelling. In less than a minute she was ushered
by Jacob Smith into the room where the mourning
party were assembled.</p>

<p>“Lady Hatfield!” cried Tom Rain, the moment she
raised her veil: and, as if her presence were another
blow on such an occasion, he staggered and would
have, fallen had not the Earl of Ellingham caught him
in his arms.</p>

<p>“Pardon this intrusion,” said Georgiana, advancing
into the middle of the apartment; “and believe me
when I assure you that nothing save the hope of being
in some degree able to lighten the afflictions which
pour upon you all&mdash;nothing,” she added emphatically,
“but such a hope as this would have induced me to
break upon your privacy. The dreadful rumours current
in the metropolis reached me ere now&mdash;and I flew
hither, only&mdash;alas! to hear them confirmed. But&mdash;Mr.
Rainford&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped short&mdash;trembled&mdash;and seemed for an
instant overcome by feelings of an unutterable nature.
The bitterness&mdash;the intensity of grief which oppressed
the others, was in some degree absorbed for the moment
by the profound interest which the presence of Lady
Hatfield excited, her words having given promise of
hopes the nature whereof defied all conjecture.</p>

<p>But suspense on the part of her listeners was not
destined to last long.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rainford,” she resumed, exercising a powerful
control over her emotions, “you have sustained an
affliction so great that it is almost impossible to impart
consolation to you. Yet&mdash;even in the midst of such
woe as this which has overtaken you&mdash;it may at least
be a satisfaction to learn that the judgment of a criminal
tribunal no longer hangs over you&mdash;that the past is
indeed the past, and cannot be revived&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Georgiana!” cried the Earl of Ellingham, surveying
her in profound astonishment; “what mean you?”</p>

<p>“I mean that Thomas Rainford is pardoned!” exclaimed
Lady Hatfield: “I mean,” she continued, the
wildest astonishment having sealed the lips of all who
heard her,&mdash;“I mean that the sentence passed upon
him months ago is dissolved&mdash;annihilated;&mdash;and here
is the royal decree&mdash;bearing the Sovereign’s seal&mdash;and
countersigned by the Secretary of the Home Department!
’Tis a full pardon for Thomas Rainford!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she handed Lord Ellingham a paper:
but it fell from his hands&mdash;for his half-brother had
sunk senseless upon the floor.</p>

<p>Water was speedily procured and all the usual means
adopted to restore him. It was, however, some time
ere he gave signs of life; and then, beckoning
Georgiana towards him, he said in a faint tone, “May
the great God above us bless you&mdash;for you are an
angel!”</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly an immense alleviation of the
general sorrow to learn that Rainford had received a
full pardon for all those offences which had drawn
down on his head the sentence of death pronounced at
the Old Bailey; and the Earl of Ellingham, having
now hastily glanced over the paper which decreed this
act of royal mercy, submitted it to the examination of
Mr. Dykes.</p>

<p>“Well, my lord,” said that officer, “I see and hear
plain enough that one of the charges on which I held
Mr. Rainford prisoner, is knocked on the head; and
I’m glad of it&mdash;’specially as ’tis the most serious of the
two. But I must still keep him in custody, he being
the man who kidnapped Sir Christopher Blunt and Dr.
Lascelles&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait&mdash;one moment!” exclaimed Rainford, a sudden
thought flashing to his mind and restoring him to
the wonted energies of his character.</p>

<p>While all present watched his movements with
breathless interest, he hastened to a writing desk
standing on a table in a recess; and thence he took a
pocket-book, which he opened, and the contents of
which he scanned rapidly as he turned over the various
papers one after the other.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” he cried triumphantly at last; and,
drawing forth a slip of paper, he handed it to Lord
Ellingham, who mechanically read it aloud:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We acknowledge a sense of deep obligation to the bearer
of this memorandum, the said bearer having rendered us
special service; and we hold ourselves bound to grant him
any boon which he may demand at our hands, so that it be
not inconsistent with our royal honour, nor prejudicial to
the interests of the State.</p>

<p>“Given this 3rd of March, in the year 1827.</p>

<p class="author">“GEORGE REX.” (L.S.)</p></blockquote>

<p>“You are saved, Thomas&mdash;you are saved, in all
respects!” exclaimed Mr. de Medina, pressing with
affectionate warmth the hand of his son-in-law, while
tears trickled down the old man’s venerable countenance.</p>

<p>“All this is so truly astonishing,” cried the Earl of
Ellingham, “that I am bewildered. How you, my
excellent friend&mdash;my sister,” he added, turning towards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Lady Hatfield, “obtained the royal pardon for
Thomas Rainford, I well know&mdash;indeed, I have all
along known.”</p>

<p>“You!” ejaculated Georgiana, in profound astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I overheard your interview with the King in
the Blue Velvet Closet at Carlton House,” continued
the Earl; “and now I comprehend all the greatness
and generosity of your conduct! Oh! and you must
pardon me too, for having become a listener on that
occasion, and for having ever since entertained suspicions
most injurious to your honour.”</p>

<p>“The remainder of the tale can then be told by myself,”
said Tom Rain, hastily: “for it was I&mdash;I, the
Blackamoor&mdash;the negro&mdash;who saved your ladyship
from insult and outrage, also at Carlton House.
But&mdash;” he continued, glancing in a significant manner
towards Dykes,&mdash;“all these explanations shall be for
another and more convenient opportunity. In the
meantime, Arthur,” he added, “it is for you to repair
at once to the Home Secretary, and obtain from him
all we require to ensure my complete freedom, by virtue
of that acknowledgment bearing the sign-manual of
the King.”</p>

<p>The Earl of Ellingham instantaneously undertook
this commission, although at so late an hour; but he
fortunately happened to be aware that the Secretary
for the Home Department had a reception that evening,
and was therefore certain to be at home.</p>

<p>Dykes, who had been led on from one source of
astonishment to another, and who perceived that
Thomas Rainford not only possessed powerful friends,
but likewise the patronage and favour of the King
himself,&mdash;the worthy Mr. Dykes, we say, now volunteered
to withdraw into another room, merely requesting
his prisoner to pledge his honour not to leave the
house until the order of the Secretary of State should
fully and completely release him from custody. The
promise was given forthwith; and Dykes repaired to
the apartment where Old Death was still remaining
in the custody of Bingham and the other constables.</p>

<p>Immediately after the officer had retired, Georgiana
rose to take her departure. This was the first time
that she had ever seen the Medinas; but she accosted
them with the affability of a well-bred lady, and proffered
them her deepest and sincerest sympathy on account
of the dreadful loss which they had sustained.
They received these proofs of friendship in a manner
which denoted the gratitude of their hearts; and
Georgiana, on taking leave, shook them cordially by
the hand.</p>

<p>Then, extending her hand likewise to him whose
mere name had hitherto been sufficient to send a cold
shudder through her entire form,&mdash;yes, extending her
hand to him also, in the true spirit of Christian forgiveness,&mdash;but
without raising her eyes to his countenance,
she said, “Mr. Rainford, may you yet know
many years of happiness!”</p>

<p>He pressed her hand with grateful fervour&mdash;and a
tear dropped upon it: but he could not utter a word.
His heart was too full to allow him to express his
thanks&mdash;his admiration of the noble conduct of that
woman whom, in a moment of delirium, as it were, he
had outraged and ruined! Ah! bitter&mdash;bitter were
thy reminiscences as thus thou didst stand before thy
generous benefactress, Tom Rain!</p>

<p>Mr. de Medina&mdash;perceiving that his son-in-law was
overcome by emotions which were not altogether intelligible
to him&mdash;offered his arm to escort Lady Hatfield
to her carriage; and Georgiana drove home with
a heart rejoicing at the good she had done&mdash;for Lord
Ellingham’s sake!</p>

<p>The Jew returned to the apartment where he had
left Esther and Rainford; and there they all three
mingled their grief together, for the loss of the lovely
and much-loved Tamar.</p>

<p>But over this scene we shall draw a veil: sorrow
such as they experienced cannot be adequately described.
Neither shall we do more than allude to the
violence of the grief and the poignancy of the anguish
which were felt when they repaired to the chamber
to which the remains of the murdered Tamar had been
conveyed. The reader does not require to be informed
that this was a ceremony of the most painful description.</p>

<p>While, therefore, Mr. de Medina, Esther, and Rainford,
are mingling their tears and lamentations,&mdash;while,
too, the Earl of Ellingham is absent on his
mission to the Home Secretary, armed with the document
which bore the autograph and seal of George
the Fourth,&mdash;we shall request our reader to accompany
us to the apartment where Old Death remains in the
custody of Bingham and the subordinate officials.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXVI">CHAPTER CXVI.<br />

<span class="medium">OLD DEATH.</span></h2>

<p>When Dykes made his appearance in the room just
alluded to, he found Benjamin Bones rocking himself
to and fro on the chair in which he was seated, while
Bingham and the runners were partaking of refreshments
at the table.</p>

<p>The old miscreant was horribly pale; end there was
a wild glaring of the eyes which enhanced the ghastly
expression of his countenance. The man was in fact
hideous to behold.</p>

<p>Now that he had leisure for reflection, and that the
excitement attending the perpetration of his bloody
vengeance had passed away, he had become fearfully
alive to the awful predicament in which be stood;
nevertheless his entire aspect denoted dogged obduracy;
and could he have recalled the past, it is more
than probable that he would have played precisely the
same part over again.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Dykes,” said Bingham, as the worthy
thus addressed entered the room, “will you jine us
here in a bit of grub? You see, we’re pitching into
the cold jint like bricks; and the beer is fust-rate.”</p>

<p>“So is the pickles,” growled one of the runners, who
was naturally of a surly disposition, and could not help
speaking in a grunting tone even when best pleased.</p>

<p>“Come, sit down with us,” urged Mr. Bingham.
“But, I say though, what have you done with Tom
Rain?”</p>

<p>“Done with, him, indeed!” exclaimed Mr. Dykes,
swelling with the importance of a man who had
astounding news to communicate: “what hasn’t he
done for his-self, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Has he cut his throat&mdash;or taken poison?” demanded
Old Death, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not he!” cried Dykes. “Why&mdash;you cursed old
fence, you’ve always got wicked notions in your head&mdash;you
have. Mr. Rainford is a genelman, every
inch of him&mdash;and I always knowed it. He’s got a
power of slap-up friends as won’t leave him long in the
lurch, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>And the officer bestowed a significant wink upon his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
listeners, whose curiosity he had now worked up to the
highest pitch.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what has he done?” gasped Old Death,
terribly excited with suspense. “Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;that
is&mdash;has he&mdash;&mdash;<em>escaped</em>?” he demanded,
scarcely able to give utterance to the word; so fearful
was he lest Tom Rain, against whom he cherished a
fiend-like hatred, should not again figure upon the
scaffold.</p>

<p>“Patience&mdash;patience,” said Mr. Dykes, taking a chair.
“In the fust place, you must know, that in comes a
lady&mdash;and who should she be but that very same Lady
Hatfield as I’m sure Tom Rain robbed some months
ago near Hounslow, although I couldn’t bring the
thing home to him at the time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well,” muttered Old Death, the agony of
whose suspense was perfectly excruciating.</p>

<p>“But fust I should tell you,” resumed Mr. Dykes,
“that Miss de Medina comes in with her father and
Lord Ellingham&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Old Death gave vent to a savage growl.</p>

<p>“And now I understand all about that diamond
affair, Bingham, you know,” continued the officer;
“<em>for, although one of the sisters is a corpse and her
face is disfigured</em>, I never in my life see such a likeness
as there is between them.”</p>

<p>We should observe that Old Death had already
learnt, from the communications which had been made
in his presence by the runners who were first in charge
of Tom Rain on this eventful evening, that it was not
Esther de Medina whom he had slain, but Tamar&mdash;the
wife of the man whom he considered to be his most
mortal enemy.</p>

<p>“But as I was a-saying,” continued Dykes, “in
comes Lady Hatfield; and, behold ye! she makes a
regular set speech to prepare us all for what’s about to
take place; and then she tells us plump that Tom Rain
has received his Majesty’s free pardon!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!” yelled forth Old Death: “it’s a lie&mdash;it’s
a lie!”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, you cursed fence!” exclaimed
Mr. Dykes, deeply indignant at having his word thus
unceremoniously called in question. “Lady Hatfield
had the paper with her, all reglar according to the
stattit in that case made and purwided.”</p>

<p>“It’s a forgery&mdash;a rank forgery!” shrieked Benjamin
Bones, his countenance becoming truly appalling
with its hideous workings. “And you have let him
go, upon that pretence&mdash;&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;you have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And he fell back in his chair, gasping for breath.</p>

<p>“Wot an inweterate old scoundrel it is,” observed
Bingham. “Here&mdash;give him a glass of beer, Bill;
for, by goles, he’ll suffocate&mdash;and the scaffold will be
cheated of its dues after all.”</p>

<p>The runner, to whom the command was addressed,
approached Old Death and offered him a tumbler of
porter: but the savage monster repulsed it brutally,
ferocious growls escaping from his breast.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;leave him alone, then,” said Bingham.</p>

<p>The runner accordingly resumed his seat and his
attack upon the cold viands at the same time.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, Mr. Ben Bones,” exclaimed
Dykes: “I have seen a many free pardons&mdash;’specially
where genelmen that got into trouble was concerned,
for it’s seldom that a poor devil has interest enough to
get such a thing&mdash;and I know precious well that the
one I see just now, was as reglar as possible. It had
the King’s own name&mdash;his sign-mangle, they call it&mdash;and
his precious big seal&mdash;and the Home Secretary’s
signatur underneath.”</p>

<p>“He will escape&mdash;he will escape yet!” yelled forth
Old Death, clasping his hands together, as if in mortal
agony. “The wretch&mdash;he will escape the gibbet&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And again he gasped in so frightful a manner that
his eyes seemed to be starting from his head, and
his attenuated frame literally writhed in convulsive
spasms.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed, after a long pause, during
which his shocking appearance had produced a dead
silence of horror and amazement: “I have thought of
something”&mdash;and he grinned malignantly. “Did you
not say that men had been spirited away&mdash;in that
Torrens’ affair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To be sure I did,” answered Bingham, to whom
the question was addressed: “and Tom Rain did it.
Well, what about that, Mr. Dykes?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;that seems to be knocked on the head also,”
was the reply: “though I have no doubt we shall get
the reward, because we did our dooty in arresting him;
and if so be that the Home Secretary chooses to grant
him a pardon in that respect also&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He won’t&mdash;he won’t!” ejaculated Old Death, with
feverish&mdash;nay, with hysterical excitement. “He does
not dare do it! No&mdash;no&mdash;Tom Rain must swing for
that, at all events! ’Tis as good as being accessory to
the murder&mdash;’tis shielding the murderers! Ha! ah!
he will swing for that&mdash;he will swing for that!”</p>

<p>“I’m blessed if he will, though,” said Dykes, bluntly;
“for it seems that he’s got a paper signed by the King
which will put him all to rights&mdash;and though I don’t
exactly understand that part of the business, I’m pretty
sure Tom Rain is in no danger. Lord Ellingham has
got the matter in hand; and he has gone up to the
Home Office. That’s why I left Mr. Rainford at liberty&mdash;just
taking his word of honour that he wouldn’t
bolt.”</p>

<p>“He’ll deceive you&mdash;he’ll run away&mdash;he’ll escape!”
cried Old Death. “You are mad to trust him! Go&mdash;seize
on him again&mdash;put hand-cuffs&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;on <em>you</em>, in no time&mdash;if you don’t hold your
tongue,” interrupted Mr. Dykes. “But ain’t all this
a rummy business, though?” he demanded, turning
towards Bingham and the subordinate officials. “The
old Jew seems a most respectable gentleman&mdash;I’d take
his bail for any amount, if I was a magistrate. And
really his daughter is a sweet young o’oman: the
Earl’s going to marry her, I’ll swear to it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dykes&mdash;Mr. Dykes,” whispered Old Death in
his ear; and the officer, turning suddenly round again,
perceived that the tall, gaunt form of the fence was
close behind him.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what do you want?” demanded the functionary.</p>

<p>“One word&mdash;one word only,” murmured Bones, in
a low, guttural, sepulchral tone, while his frame shook
with nervous excitement: “one word, I say&mdash;only one
word.”</p>

<p>“Now, then&mdash;what is it?” asked Dykes, suffering
the old man to draw him towards the recess containing
the door which opened into the laboratory.</p>

<p>“I must speak to you in private&mdash;I have something
particular to tell you,” was the urgent and impatient
reply. “Come into this room&mdash;I shan’t keep you a
moment.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I suppose I must humour you,” said the
officer, in a surly tone. “One should look upon you
as a dead man; for besides your nick-name, the law
will soon make you one in right good earnest.”</p>

<p>With this brutal jest&mdash;brutal even in respect to so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
awful a miscreant as Old Death&mdash;the Bow Street functionary
conducted him into the laboratory, where a
light happened to be burning, and the door of which
apartment Benjamin Bones closed cautiously behind
them.</p>

<p>“Now, then&mdash;make haste, and tell us all you have
got to say,” said Dykes, eyeing the old man suspiciously
and in such a meaning fashion as to imply
that any attempt at escape would assuredly prove
abortive.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dykes, you are a good man&mdash;and a kind man&mdash;I
know you are,” began Old Death, in a coaxing
tone and with a manner indicating the most dreadful
state of nervous excitement: “you would not like to
see a poor, miserable old creature like myself sent to&mdash;to&mdash;the
scaffold. No&mdash;no&mdash;you would not&mdash;you would
not. But I know that it must be made worth your
while&mdash;you understand me&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I will give
you all I have&mdash;yes, all I have&mdash;several thousand
pounds&mdash;for I have got several thousands!” he added,
with a ghastly grin. “But no one knows where they
are except myself,&mdash;and you and I can go together to
the place&mdash;and I will give you every guinea&mdash;yes,
every guinea, Mr. Dykes&mdash;remember, every guinea I
say&mdash;if you will agree to this.”</p>

<p>“Agree to what?” demanded Dykes, affecting not
to comprehend the old villain.</p>

<p>“Oh! just as if you didn’t understand me, my dear
friend&mdash;my good, kind friend!” exclaimed Benjamin
Bones, becoming more coaxing in his tone, which was
as low and subdued as his sepulchral voice would
admit. “Do consider for an instant&mdash;an old man
like me to be in such trouble! You wouldn’t be happy
if you had it on your mind that you had been the
means&mdash;the actual means of sending such a wretched
creature as myself to the scaffold? Speak to me, Mr.
Dykes! Five thousand pounds&mdash;yes&mdash;five thousand
pounds, in good gold guineas&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If what?” asked the officer, with the most provoking
determination not to understand any thing that
was not explained in unmistakeable words.</p>

<p>“If you&mdash;you will let me escape!” whispered Old
Death, while his eyes seemed to penetrate to the very
soul of the man towards whom he bent in a confidential
way as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Now that’s English,” said Dykes, whose countenance
gave not the least indication of the manner in
which he intended to receive the proposition.</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and you will agree, won’t you?” asked
Bones. “Remember&mdash;five thousand guineas&mdash;all to
be paid in one lump&mdash;this very night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, now&mdash;it can’t be done, old chap,” interrupted
Dykes, in a cool&mdash;almost brutal manner, as if he were
glad of the opportunity to encourage hope for a time,
merely for the sake of destroying it with a rude hand
and in an abrupt way.</p>

<p>“It can’t be done,” murmured Old Death, despair
seizing upon him: “it can’t be done, you say?”&mdash;and
his eyes glanced wildly around.</p>

<p>“Is this all you have to tell me?” demanded the
officer. “Because, if so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Five thousand guineas!&mdash;and he refuses it!” ejaculated
Bones. “My God! what will become of me?&mdash;what
will become of me?”</p>

<p>And still his looks wandered rapidly about the apartment.</p>

<p>“Now, then&mdash;let as go back into the next room, if
you please,” said Dykes; “for I don’t see no use in
staying here, wasting our time.”</p>

<p>At that instant Old Death’s eyes settled upon something
on a shelf close at hand; and, suddenly springing
aside, he seized upon a bottle&mdash;the particular object
for which he had been searching with his eager
glances.</p>

<p>Dykes, without even having a moment’s leisure to
make a single conjecture relative to his intentions, but
instinctively foreseeing that something wrong was
contemplated, closed upon the old man in an instant.</p>

<p>With the speed of lightning did Benjamin Bones
raise the bottle which his right hand grasped; and in
leas than the twinkling of an eye would it have been
smashed down upon the officer, who, seeing his danger,
by a natural impulse held down his head&mdash;when a yell
of agony burst from the lips of the old miscreant.</p>

<p>For, as he raised the bottle, the glass stopper fell
out, and the burning vitriol streamed down on his
head and over his countenance, a few drops only falling
upon Dykes, and those principally on his clothes.</p>

<p>The officer instantaneously fell back; and Old
Death threw himself on the floor, where he rolled in
horrid agonies&mdash;writhing like a stricken snake, and
shrieking franticly, “Oh! my eyes! my eyes!”</p>

<p>Bingham and the subordinate functionaries rushed
in from the adjoining apartment; and, having assured
themselves that Dykes was unhurt&mdash;although his
escape from the burning fluid was truly miraculous&mdash;they
turned their attention towards Old Death. One
of them obtained water, and dashed it over him; but
still he rolled and writhed&mdash;uttering dreadful cries,
mingled with horrid imprecations&mdash;and rubbing his
face madly with his hands. For the miserable wretch
was burnt in an appalling manner; and his sight was
gone!</p>

<p>We must pause for a single moment to explain his
design&mdash;that design which so signally failed and
brought down such frightful consequences upon himself.
Perceiving that all hope of being able to bribe
Mr. Dykes was frustrated, he thought of the only
alternative that could possibly be attempted&mdash;an escape.
At the same instant that this last idea was
formed, it flashed to his mind that Dr. Lascelles had
been accustomed to keep many deadly poisons and
ardent fluids in the laboratory. His eyes wandered
round in search of them; and they lighted upon a
large bottle, labelled “Vitriol.” To break it over the
officer’s head, and escape in the confusion that must
ensue by means of the little chamber which had once
been his bed-room, and which, as the reader may
recollect, had two doors&mdash;one opening from the laboratory,
and the other into apartments beyond,&mdash;this was
the hastily conceived but discomfitted design of Old
Death!</p>

<p>The desperate project had failed&mdash;and in a desperate
manner, too: for the miscreant had received mortal
injuries&mdash;and his sufferings were horrible. A pint of
vitriol had streamed over his head&mdash;penetrating beneath
his clothes, all down his neck and chest&mdash;burning
him horribly, even to his very eyes in their sockets!</p>

<p>Rainford, alarmed by the hideous yells which had
reached him in another part of the spacious house,
rushed into the laboratory to ascertain the cause, having
begged Mr. de Medina and Esther to await his
return. At the same instant that he entered by one
door, Jacob Smith made his appearance by another;
and Dykes hastily explained what had occurred.
Rainford accordingly issued immediate orders to transport
the dying man to a bed-chamber; and fortunately,
at this crisis, Dr. Lascelles arrived at the house.</p>

<p>The physician had been alarmed by the rumours
which prevailed relative to the incidents that had occurred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
in Red Lion Street: but a few words, rapidly
exchanged with Tom Rain, relieved the doctor of all
apprehensions on account of his friend&mdash;and all his
attention was now devoted to Old Death.</p>

<div id="i_025" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But though the laboratory promptly supplied all the
remedies needed in such a case, their application was
vain. They gave relief, it is true: but they could
not arrest the rapid advances which death was making
upon the wretched old man.</p>

<p>“Jacob,” cried the doctor: “Jacob Smith, I say,” he
repeated more impatiently, the lad not having heard
his first summons; “hand me that bottle, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Jacob Smith!” cried Old Death, his moanings
suddenly ceasing at the mention of that name: “is he
here? Then let me tell him&mdash;&mdash;My God! this burning
sensation&mdash;&mdash;Jacob&mdash;Jacob&mdash;my poor boy&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
my eyes&mdash;my eyes&mdash;&mdash;doctor, do something to my
eyes&mdash;they are like red hot coals in my head&mdash;&mdash;Jacob&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am
your&mdash;&mdash;father!”</p>

<p>“My father!” almost shrieked the lad, in the wildness
of his amazement at these tidings: then, falling
on his knees by the bed-side, he exclaimed, “Oh! if
you are indeed my parent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am&mdash;I am, Jacob,” exclaimed the dying wretch:
“but these tortures&mdash;&mdash;why do they tear my flesh
with pincers?&mdash;why do they put hot skewers into my
eyes? Doctor&mdash;doctor&mdash;&mdash;take away the red-hot iron&mdash;&mdash;lift
me out of the fire&mdash;&mdash;take me away, I say&mdash;save
me&mdash;save me&mdash;I am in flames&mdash;I am burning&mdash;&mdash;My
God! I am burning!”</p>

<p>“Father&mdash;father,” cried Jacob, in a tone of agonising
appeal; “compose yourself&mdash;think of all your sins&mdash;repent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will no one snatch me from the fire?” yelled
forth Old Death, writhing and tossing upon the bed in
mortal pains: “perdition seize ye, wretches&mdash;I am
burning&mdash;I am in flames&mdash;my eyes scorch me&mdash;my
flesh is all seared over with red-hot irons&mdash;&mdash;Oh! it
is hell&mdash;it is hell! Yes&mdash;I am in hell&mdash;&mdash;My God!
this is my punishment! Oh! send me back to the
world again&mdash;let me retrieve the past&mdash;let me live
my existence once more&mdash;I will be good&mdash;I will not
sin! No&mdash;no&mdash;for hell is terribly&mdash;terrible&mdash;and these
fires&mdash;&mdash;Oh! horror&mdash;horror&mdash;snakes of flame have
seized upon me&mdash;&mdash;they are gnawing at my heart&mdash;they
have thrust their fiery stings into my eyes&mdash;they
wind themselves round and round me&mdash;horror&mdash;horror&mdash;there&mdash;I
feel them now&mdash;Oh! mercy&mdash;mercy&mdash;&mdash;mercy&mdash;&mdash;mer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This is frightful!” whispered Tom Rain to Dr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Lascelles; and all the others present at the dreadful
scene; shuddered from head to foot.</p>

<p>Jacob Smith buried his face in his hands and sobbed
convulsively.</p>

<p>The dying man still continued to rave, and shriek,
and yell for a short time longer: but his powers of
articulation rapidly failed&mdash;his writhings grew less
violent, until they ceased altogether,&mdash;and in a few
minutes, the dark spirit which had never spared and
never pitied human creature, fled for ever!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXVII">CHAPTER CXVII.<br />

<span class="medium">AN EXPLANATORY CONVERSATION.</span></h2>

<p>Three days had elapsed since that eventful evening
on which so many exciting incidents occurred; and
the scene now changes to the dwelling of Dr. Lascelles
in Grafton Street.</p>

<p>It was about four in the afternoon and the physician
was seated in his study, Lord Ellingham being
his companion at the time.</p>

<p>“At length, my dear doctor,” said the nobleman,
“you have found leisure to accord me an hour to give
me those explanations which my afflicted brother feels
himself incapable to enter into at present. The loss of
Tamar, whose funeral is to take place the day after to-morrow,
has proved almost a mortal blow to his generous
heart: but the kindness of Mr. de Medina and
Esther, who insisted upon having him with them at
Finchley, must in some degree mitigate his grief. And
yet, alas! that bereaved father and mourning sister
have themselves such bitter need of solace! Just
heaven! it was a frightful catastrophe!”</p>

<p>“And the murderer perished in a frightful manner,”
added the physician. “But now that the excitement
created by these appalling events, and by all the other
circumstances which Old Death’s crime was the means
of bringing to light, has somewhat subsided,&mdash;not only
in respect to the public, but likewise with regard to the
minds of those persons privately interested in the
whole affair,&mdash;we may venture to converse upon the
topic in the hope of approaching it with some degree
of calmness. In the first place, my dear Arthur, tell
me how you fared with the Home Secretary&mdash;I mean,
give me the details of your visit to that Minister.”</p>

<p>“On my arrival at his official residence,” said the
Earl, “on the dreadful night in question, I sent up my
card with a message soliciting an immediate and private
audience; and the favour was instantaneously
granted. In as succinct a manner as possible, I explained
to the Minister all that it was necessary to
communicate. I told him that Thomas Rainford, who
had been doomed to death and publicly executed, had
survived the frightful ordeal of the scaffold; but relative
to the means or the agents of his resuscitation,
I proffered no explanation&mdash;and none was demanded
of me. The Minister instantly recollected the circumstance
of having signed a full and complete pardon on
behalf of Rainford, some weeks ago, and at the intercession
of the King; and, doubtless knowing well the
wayward character of George the Fourth, he perhaps
thought that the less he enquired into the business,
the better. I then gave him as much information
relative to the recent proceedings of Rainford as
was known to myself; and when the Minister heard
that he was the individual who had played so
mysterious a part in the affair of Torrens, his brow
lowered. But I immediately showed him the document
signed by George the Fourth; and I gave him to
understand that Rainford was acquainted with such
proofs of the King’s profligacy and unprincipled
character, as would positively compromise the safety
of the throne if they were published. This species
of threat I was compelled to hold out, inasmuch as the
Home Secretary seemed inclined to permit matters to
take their course without any interference on his part.
But, when he heard that the King had given that solemn
acknowledgment of obligation in order to hush up
some affair of which he was ashamed and likewise
seriously alarmed, the Minister intimated his readiness
to do any thing I required to avoid a scandal that
might compromise his royal master. He nevertheless
urged that an immense excitement had already been
created in the metropolis, and which would of course
spread to the provinces, by that sudden discovery that
Thomas Rainford had not only escaped the scaffold,
but had actually taken upon himself the functions of a
judge in disposing of the murderers of Sir Henry
Courtenay, according to his own caprice and will. ‘<em>In
fact</em>,’ said the Minister, ‘<em>the public will imagine that
Rainford himself was an accomplice in the assassination
of the baronet; and every one will ask what
has been done with the two men, Splint and Pedler,
who have thus been spirited away</em>.’&mdash;To this I could
only reply that I was well assured of Rainford’s complete
innocence in respect to the murder of Sir Henry
Courtenay; that he had adopted certain opinions relative
to the reformation of criminals, and had chosen to
test his system by applying it to those men; that the
men were no longer in the country, but whither they
had been sent I knew full well Rainford would never
divulge to the Government; and that the Minister
must decide between two alternatives&mdash;namely, whether
he would dare public opinion in the case, or whether
he would have his royal master seriously compromised.
I can assure you, my dear doctor, that it gave me
great pain and was most repugnant to my feelings to
be compelled to hold out any menace of this kind
but could I leave a stone unturned that would serve
the interest of my generous half-brother?”</p>

<p>“You already to some extent know the motives
which induced Rainford to return to England instead
of proceeding to America, and adopt the disguise under
the cloak of which he broke up Old Death’s gang?”
said the physician, enquiringly.</p>

<p>“I gathered a few rapid and broken details from
the Medinas, during the ride from Finchley to Red
Lion Street, on that fatal evening when Jacob Smith
came to the Manor, where I happened to be at the
time, to announce the awful event which had occurred,”
replied the Earl. “But you may readily believe that
both Mr. de Medina and Esther were too profoundly
afflicted to be able to give me any very minute explanations.
Moreover, I was myself so terribly excited,
and so full of serious apprehensions&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand&mdash;’twas quite natural,” interrupted
the doctor. “But pray proceed with your narrative
of the interview with the Secretary of State.”</p>

<p>“I have little more to say upon that subject,” observed
Lord Ellingham. “The Minister balanced for
some minutes between the alternatives which I submitted
to him, and it was evident that he felt deeply
grieved and chagrined at the consequences of the royal
indiscretions,&mdash;indiscretions which had led the King
to sign two important papers, both seriously affecting
the proper and legitimate course of justice. But, in
the end, he yielded to the alternative which was favourable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
to our wishes; and, placing himself at his
desk, he wrote the order to set Thomas Rainford free,
which I delivered to the Bow Street officers on my
return to Red Lion Street shortly after midnight.”</p>

<p>“It is therefore certain that no further apprehensions
need be entertained on that head?” enquired the
physician.</p>

<p>“None,” answered the Earl of Ellingham. “The
Coroner’s Inquest, which sate upon the bodies of
Tamar and Benjamin Bones yesterday, elicited, as you
are well aware, the fact that the old man had been
imprisoned by Rainford, and visited first by Esther,
and on the last and fatal occasion by her unfortunate
sister, merely with a view to his reformation and redemption
from a course of crime&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And, therefore,” added the physician, “public
opinion is actually in favour of Rainford at this moment.
But how happened it that Lady Hatfield was
enabled to procure that document which conferred a
full pardon upon him?”</p>

<p>“That woman possesses a most generous&mdash;a most
noble heart!” exclaimed the Earl. “The voluptuous
monarch sought to render her the victim of his lust;
and it suddenly struck her, when his designs became
unmistakeably apparent, that she might avail herself
of the circumstance to perform an act calculated to
exhibit her sincere friendship for me. She accordingly
affected to yield in a certain measure to his disgusting
overtures: she overcame the natural scruples of a pure
soul, so far as to give vague promises and encourage
the King’s passion, in order to obtain from him the
document which she required. And she succeeded.
But, on the occasion of that interview with the King
at which he presented her with the precious paper,
she was nearly falling a victim to her generous conduct
and to his brutal violence. An extraordinary combination
of circumstances, however, had led Rainford
into the palace on that very evening; and accident
enabled him not only to deliver Georgiana from the
power of the King, but likewise to extort from his
Majesty that written promise of deep obligation which
has proved so vitally important to his interests.”</p>

<p>“The entire affair is truly romantic,” observed the
doctor. “And now you wish me to give you in detail
an explanation of all Rainford’s late proceedings?”</p>

<p>“I am already acquainted with much concerning
them, and conjecture enables me to comprehend more,”
resumed the nobleman: “at the same time, I should be
pleased to hear a connected account from your lips.”</p>

<p>“It is by no means a disagreeable task for me to
narrate incidents which prove the existence of so many
generous traits in the heart of that man whom I was
the means of restoring to life and to the world,” said
Dr. Lascelles; “for since that day on which he opened
his eyes in my laboratory, I have regarded him almost
in the light of a son. I must begin by informing you
that Rainford was deeply touched by a conversation
which he had with you, relative to the miseries and
crimes of the poor and ignorant classes of society&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That conversation took place in the evening following
his resuscitation,” observed Arthur,&mdash;“the same
evening on which I captured Benjamin Bones, as he
was ascending from the subterranean.”</p>

<p>“The discourse which yourself and your half-brother
had together on that occasion,” resumed the doctor,
“induced him to reflect profoundly upon the nature of
crime&mdash;the circumstances which engender, and afterwards
encourage it&mdash;and the best modes of producing
a reformation. That train of thought led him to ponder
upon other matters, essentially regarding yourself.
For he saw that Benjamin Bones would prove your
most implacable enemy: he knew that old man’s
character well&mdash;and he felt assured that he would
devise and carry into effect some atrocious schemes of
vengeance against you. These convictions filled Rainford’s
mind with the gloomiest apprehensions, although
he contrived to veil them from you. He trembled lest
you should fall into the snares which that incarnate
fiend&mdash;God forgive me for speaking ill of the dead&mdash;was
certain to spread at your feet; and he resolved to
adopt some means to counteract the effects of that
man’s malignant spite. In a word, he determined, at
any sacrifice, to watch over that brother who had
acted so generously and nobly towards him. But not
to a soul did he communicate his ideas, until he had
safely embarked, with Tamar, Jacob Smith, and Charley
Watts, on board the American packet-ship at Havre-de-Grace.
Then he revealed his intentions to Tamar;
and she immediately fell into his views&mdash;for she knew
no will save his own. The captain of the ship consented,
for a reward, to touch at Guernsey; and there
Rainford, his wife, the youth, and the boy, were landed
in the middle of the night. The next morning, your
half-brother and C&aelig;sar appeared in the disguise of
blackamoors; and from Saint Peter’s Port, the capital
of the island, they sailed for Weymouth&mdash;Tamar with
Charley Watts proceeding by way of Southampton.
The rendezvous was London; and all Rainford’s plans,
so far as he could forecast them, were already arranged.
On her arrival in the metropolis, Tamar immediately
sent for her father and sister to the inn at which she
alighted; and to them she communicated her husband’s
design. It was of course necessary to keep the
entire scheme concealed from yourself; as it was well
known that you would never rest until you had persuaded
your brother to quit the country again, were
you aware of his return. At that time you were not
engaged to Esther; and she had therefore no hesitation
in maintaining this much of duplicity towards you.
Subsequently&mdash;I mean, after your engagement together&mdash;she
felt herself bound still to guard inviolably a
secret that had your welfare as its basis. Well, then,
Mr. de Medina and Esther lent themselves to the project&mdash;and
cheerfully too, because they recognised all
the importance of allowing Rainford to adopt the
necessary measures to ensure your complete safety.
Tamar and Charley Watts accordingly took up their
abode at Finchley Manor, the proper precautions being
taken to enable them to dwell there in the strictest
privacy, and the fidelity of the servants being well
assured in respect to their presence at that house. So
far all proceeded satisfactorily; and in the meantime
Rainford, accompanied by Jacob Smith, whom he
named C&aelig;sar, arrived in London. You may conceive
my surprise when one evening, having been informed
by my servant that an East Indian gentleman was
waiting to see me in the drawing-room, I proceeded
to that apartment and found myself in the presence
of Thomas Rainford! I did not recognize him at once;
but he speedily made himself known to me; and,
when his plans were developed, I readily agreed to aid
him in their accomplishment. As he had expected
and indeed calculated, I had full and complete control
over the houses in Red Lion and Turnmill Streets;
and he felt convinced that you would never think of
visiting them. You had purchased them merely to
deprive Benjamin Bones of the power of plunging his
victims into the subterranean cells; and you allowed
me the use of the premises for my laboratory. Under
all these circumstances, the house in Red Lion Street
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
was the best suited to Rainford’s designs; and it was
speedily furnished in a suitable manner. The neighbours
believed that a retired East Indian merchant
had taken the place; and therefore no surprise&mdash;no
excitement was occasioned, when they perceived that
the new tenant had his private carriage and numerous
dependants. But how did Rainford manage to obtain
the assistance of several faithful persons, who were
blindly obedient to his will, and to one of whom&mdash;named
Wilton&mdash;he entrusted his entire history? They
were all poor and deserving persons whom I knew well&mdash;men
who had at different times been my patients,
and in whom I felt an interest. Thus, in a very few
days, the most complete arrangements were effected;
and just at the moment when Rainford was prepared
to commence operations, and when he had succeeded
in tracing the abode of Benjamin Bones, chance threw
him in the way of a certain John Jeffreys, whom he
resolved to render subservient to his purposes in uprooting
the atrocious gang.”</p>

<p>The physician then proceeded to relate the manner
in which Rainford had drawn Jeffreys into his service,&mdash;the
revelations made to him by that individual’s unfolding
all the dreadful schemes of vengeance contemplated
by Old Death, and directed against the
happiness of the Earl himself,&mdash;the projected exhumation
of the coffin in Saint Luke’s church-yard, and the
ferocious idea of blinding Lady Hatfield and Esther de
Medina,&mdash;the mode in which these diabolical aims
were frustrated by the arrest of all the members of
Old Death’s gang,&mdash;and the faithful conduct of Jeffreys.
Dr. Lascelles also narrated the proceedings of
Rainford in the difficult affair of Mr. Torrens,&mdash;how,
disguised as an old man, and admirably sustaining
that character, he had entrapped Sir Christopher Blunt
to the house in Red Lion Street to preside at the examination
of the two prisoners,&mdash;and how he (Dr.
Lascelles) had become a party to that transaction,&mdash;all
of which particulars are well known to the reader.
Finally, the physician made the Earl acquainted with
the nature and the results of the system of reformation
applied to all the members of the gang,&mdash;how it had
succeeded in respect to Tidmarsh, the Bunces, Pedler
and Splint,&mdash;and how Esther de Medina had deputed
her unfortunate sister to visit Benjamin Bones on that
fatal evening which was characterised by a savage
murder!</p>

<p>There was only one point connected with Rainford’s
affairs, on which the Earl and the physician did
not touch; and this was the parentage of little Charley
Watts. The doctor was unacquainted with the fact
that Rainford had some years back forcibly violated
the person of Lady Hatfield, and that the issue of this
crime was the boy who still bore the name by which
we have just called him. The Earl of Ellingham
naturally veiled the circumstance even from a friend
so intimate and sincere as Lascelles; and though
the doctor knew that Lady Hatfield had been a
mother, he also kept this knowledge to himself, and
was very far from suspecting the true history of
Charley Watts. Lascelles, it will be remembered,
had made the discovery relative to Georgiana on that
occasion when he attended her in her severe illness,
and when he gave her a soporific, as recorded in the
early part of this work: but he had never mentioned
that discovery to a soul;&mdash;and the Earl of Ellingham
was as far from supposing that Lady Hatfield’s loss of
chastity was known to the physician, as the physician
was from entertaining even the remotest idea relative
to the parentage of the boy.</p>

<p>But Rainford was already aware that this boy was
his own son&mdash;the issue of the outrage which he had
perpetrated upon Lady Hatfield! Yes&mdash;on the evening
before this interview between the Earl of Ellingham
and Dr. Lascelles, the former had so far intruded
upon his brother’s profound grief, as to make to him
a revelation which a sense of duty forbade him to
delay. Rainford also learnt, at the same time, that
Georgiana was herself acquainted with the fact of her
child being in his care&mdash;placed under his protection as
it were by the inscrutable decrees of Providence! But
for the sake of the honour of Lady Hatfield, and of
sparing Rainford from the necessity of giving unpleasant
and degrading explanations to his friends,
it had been determined between Lord Ellingham and
himself that the boy should still continue to bear the
name of Watts, and that his real parentage should be
unacknowledged&mdash;at least for the present.</p>

<p>In order not to dwell with tedious minuteness upon
this portion of our narrative, we shall briefly state that
the funeral of Tamar took place on the day appointed;
and if the tears of heart-felt grief streaming from the
eyes of true mourners can avail for the souls of the
departed, then the spirit of the murdered Jewess must
have received ample solace and full propitiation in
those regions to which it had taken wing!</p>

<p>But how deep a gloom had fallen upon the family of
Medina;&mdash;and how poignant was the anguish which
the bereaved father and sister experienced for the
departed!</p>

<p>Nor less acute was the sorrow of the husband who
survived that fair but prematurely crushed flower of
Israel;&mdash;for immense was thy love for her, Tom
Rain!</p>

<span class="medium">THE INSOLVENT DEBTORS’ COURT.</span></h2>

<p>Passing through Portugal Street, Lincoln’s Inn
Fields, you may perceive a low, dingy-looking building,
protected by a row of tall iron railings, and with
steps leading to the front entrance. This structure is
of so dubious an aspect that it places the stranger in
a profound state of uncertainty as to whether it be the
lobby of a criminal prison or a Methodist chapel; and
the supposed stranger is not a little surprised when he
learns, on inquiry, that this architectural mystery is
neither more nor less than the Court for the Relief of
Insolvent Debtors.</p>

<p>At about nine o’clock in the morning the immediate
vicinity of the Court begins to wear a very business-like
appearance: that is to say, both sides of the street
are thronged with the most curious specimens of
human nature which it is possible to encounter outside
of Newgate or of the Bench. The wonder is whence
such a host of ill-looking fellows can have sprung, or
whither they can be going, unless it is to either of the
two places just named. Then comes the natural
question, “But who are they?” The answer is at
hand: some are the turnkeys of the County Prisons
and the tipstaves of the Bench, having in their charge
prisoners about to be heard at the Court,&mdash;others are
the usual hangers-on and errand-seekers who are always
to be found lurking about such places,&mdash;while a
third set are the friends or else the opposing creditors
of the Insolvents. The public-house opposite the
Court, and the one at the side are also filled with
persons of those descriptions; and before ten o’clock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
in the morning many pots of porter are disposed of&mdash;many
quarterns of gin dispensed in two or three “outs”&mdash;and
many screws of tobacco puffed off in smoke.</p>

<p>Inside the Court, business commences in somewhat
a more serious manner. Four or five barristers take
their places in a large box divided into two compartments
like pews in a church: a couple of Commissioners
seat themselves on a bench made in very
humble imitation indeed of those in the Courts at
Westminster;&mdash;a single reporter lounges into the snug
crib so kindly allotted to the representatives of the
press;&mdash;several attorneys and attorneys’ clerks gather
round the table between the counsel’s seats and the
bench:&mdash;the Insolvents are penned up altogether in a
sort of human fold on the right as you go into the
tribunal;&mdash;and at the back a crowd of unwashed faces
rise amphitheatrically in the compartment appropriated
to the audience. The Commissioners endeavour to
look as much like the Judges of the Land as possible;&mdash;the
barristers affect all the consequence and airs of
Serjeants-at-Law or King’s Counsel;&mdash;the Insolvents
try to seem as happy as if they had nothing awkward
in their schedules to account for;&mdash;and the spectators
raise heaven and earth to appear respectable: but each
and all of these attempts are the most decided failures
which it is possible to conceive. A general air of seediness
pervades the place: the professional wigs are
dirty and out of curl, and the forensic gowns thread-bare;&mdash;and
the disagreeable impression thus created
on the mind of the visitor, is enhanced to no trifling
degree by a sickly smell of perspiration combined with
the stale odour of tobacco smoke retained in the garments
of the audience.</p>

<p>Amongst the Insolvents were two individuals whose
appearance formed a most striking contrast. These
were Mr. Joshua Sheepshanks and Mr. Frank Curtis.</p>

<p>The former was dressed in deep black, with a white
neck-cloth, and black cotton gloves a great deal too
large for his hands: he had also put black crape round
his hat, in the hope of creating the sympathy of the
Commissioners by producing the impression of having
sustained some serious and recent family loss. His
sallow face was elongated with the awful sanctimoniousness
which characterised it: his black hair was
combed sleekly down over his forehead;&mdash;and he sate
bolt upright on the hard bench, every now and then
raising his eyes to heaven&mdash;or rather to the lanthorn
on the roof of the Court&mdash;as if in silent prayer.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank Curtis was attired in his habitually flash
manner; and as he lolled back in his seat, he now and
then bestowed a significant wink upon his attorney
at the table, or exchanged a few familiar observations
with the tipstaff, whom he had treated to egg-hot at
the public-house opposite before they entered the
Court.</p>

<p>But where was Captain O’Blunderbuss? Had he
deserted his friend on this trying occasion? Gentle
reader, do not suppose for an instant that the gallant
officer was capable of what he himself would describe
to be the “most bastely maneness”&mdash;so long as Frank
had a shilling left in his pocket, or the ability to raise
one! The captain, then, <em>was</em> there&mdash;and in the
vicinity of Mr. Curtis; for the terrible Irishman had
posted himself as near as possible to the box in which
the Insolvents stand to be examined&mdash;in the first
place, that when Frank should mount to that “bad
eminence,” he might be close by to encourage him with
his looks; and, in the second place, he had taken that
particular stand as the one whence he could best dart
ferocious glances at the Commissioners, in case these
functionaries should take it into their heads to deal
harshly with his friend.</p>

<p>And now the business of that day’s proceeding,
commenced; and the Clerk of the Court bawled out
in a loud tone&mdash;“Joshua Sheepshanks!”</p>

<p>“Here, my Christian friend!” groaned the religious
gentleman, drawing himself slowly up to his
full, thin, lanky height, and beginning to move slowly
and solemnly towards the box above-mentioned.</p>

<p>“Now, then&mdash;Joshua Sheepshanks!” cried the
clerk, in a sharp tone.</p>

<p>“Come&mdash;Joshua Sheepshanks&mdash;look alive!” grumbled
the official who administers the oaths to the
Insolvents.</p>

<p>“Cut along, old fellow,” whispered Frank Curtis,
giving the sanctimonious dissenter a hearty pinch on
the leg as he passed by.</p>

<p>Mr. Sheepshanks uttered a low moan&mdash;cast up his
eyes towards the lanthorn&mdash;muttered something about
his having “fallen amongst the ungodly”&mdash;and ended
by hoisting himself into the box with some degree of
alacrity, his slow movements having rendered the
Court impatient.</p>

<p>“Does any counsel appear for you, Joshua Sheepshanks?”
demanded the clerk.</p>

<p>“None&mdash;unless it be the Lord’s will that I should
be supported by divine grace,” answered the dissenting
minister, in so doleful a tone and with such a
solemn shaking of the head that the whole Court was
alarmed lest he was about to go off in a fit.</p>

<p>“I appear to oppose on behalf of several creditors,”
said Mr. Bulliwell, one of the leading barristers practising
in that Court.</p>

<p>“Oh! the persevering bitterness of those rancorous
men!” exclaimed Mr. Sheepshanks, clasping his
hands together, and turning up the whites of his eyes
in an appalling fashion.</p>

<p>“Silence, Insolvent!” cried the clerk, in a sharp
tone.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Commissioners had both been taking
a long and simultaneous stare at the religious gentleman;
and though one was purblind and the other in
his dotage, they nevertheless seemed to arrive in the
long run at pretty well the same conclusion&mdash;which
was, that Mr. Sheepshanks was a dreadful humbug.
The glances they interchanged through their spectacles
expressed to each other this conviction; and the
sharper of the two, who rejoiced in the name of
Sneesby, forthwith proceeded to examine the schedule.</p>

<p>“I see that you were once a missionary in the <cite>South-Sea
Islands Bible Circulating Society</cite>, Insolvent?”
said this learned functionary.</p>

<p>“Under the divine favour, I was such a vessel in
the good cause,” answered Mr. Sheepshanks, with the
invariable nasal twang of hypocrisy.</p>

<p>“A what?” demanded Mr. Commissioner Sneesby,
in an impatient tone.</p>

<p>“He says he was a <em>vessel</em>, sir,” observed Mr. Bulliwell,
the barrister. “It is a word much in vogue
amongst the religious world.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the Insolvent calls himself a vessel&mdash;does
he?” exclaimed the Commissioner. “Well&mdash;he has
come to a pretty anchorage at last.”</p>

<p>“And yet, sir, I can assure you he is no anchorite,”
said Mr. Bulliwell.</p>

<p>These were jokes on the part of the Commissioner
and the counsel; and therefore the attorneys, the
clerks, and the audience tittered, as in duty bound
when the wig forgot its wisdom and indulged in wit;
and the Insolvents all laughed too&mdash;but for another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
reason. In fact, Mr. Frank Curtis had applied his
right hand to his nose, and extended it in a fan-like
form&mdash;or, in other words, he “took a sight” at the
learned Commissioner, and worked an imaginary
coffee-mill at the same time with his left hand.</p>

<p>Order being restored, the business proceeded.</p>

<p>“And, having been a missionary, I observe by your
schedule, that you turned a Dissenting Minister, Insolvent?”
said Mr. Commissioner Sneesby, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“I was a brand snatched from the burning, sir,”
replied Mr. Sheepshanks; “and, having sorely wrestled
with Satan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Give me a direct answer, man!” cried the Commissioner,
sharply. “Did you leave an institution
connected with the Established Church and become a
dissenter?”</p>

<p>“Heaven so willed it,” responded the sanctimonious
insolvent, in a droning voice: “I had a call&mdash;and I
obeyed it.”</p>

<p>“Who opposes this man?” enquired the Commissioner.</p>

<p>“Jeremiah Chubbley!” vociferated the Clerk of the
Court.</p>

<p>“Here!” growled a man dressed as a bricklayer.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Jeremiah Chubbley&mdash;stand up in the
witness-box,” continued the clerk.</p>

<p>“Come, Mr. Chubbley&mdash;make haste,” said Mr.
Bulliwell, the barrister, speaking more civilly and
using the honorary prefix of <em>Mister</em>, because he had
been retained by the individual to whom he applied it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chubbley mounted the witness-box; and while
the oath was being administered to him, both the
Commissioners inflicted a long stare on his countenance
just to satisfy themselves by this physiognomical
scrutiny whether he were a trust-worthy person or
not;&mdash;for Commissioners in the Insolvents’ Court are
great physiognomists&mdash;very great physiognomists indeed.</p>

<p>“Your name is Jeremiah Chubbley?” said Mr.
Bulliwell, rising in a stately manner, and darting a
ferocious glance towards Mr. Sheepshanks, as much
as to say&mdash;“Now, my man, I am going to elicit things
against you that will prove you to be the greatest
rogue in existence.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;my name be Chubbley, sir,” answered the
opposing creditor. “But I paid you to tackle that
there sneaking-looking chap over there, and not to
ke-vestion me.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” said Mr. Bulliwell, blandly, “this
is the way of conducting an opposition where counsel
is employed. Your name is Jeremiah Chubbley; and
you are a master-bricklayer, I believe?”</p>

<p>“I told ’ee so a veek ago,” replied the opposing
creditor, savagely.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: but you must tell the learned Commissioners
all over again what you told me,” gently remonstrated
Mr. Bulliwell. “I believe you are the
proprietor of a chapel in the Tottenham Court Road?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I be, sir,” responded Mr. Chubbley. “I
built she&mdash;and a stronger, better, or more comfortabler
place of washup you wouldn’t find in all London&mdash;least
ways, barrin’ St. Paul’s.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;and this chapel was to let some three or
four months ago, I believe?” continued Mr. Bulliwell.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it were, sir: and I had blackguards up at
the grocer’s round the corner&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Had what, man?” demanded the Commissioners
simultaneously, and as it were in the same breath.</p>

<p>“He means that he put placards up at a neighbouring
grocer’s, sir,” mildly explained Mr. Bulliwell,
then, turning again to the opposing creditor, the
learned counsel said, “And I believe that the Insolvent
was attracted by the placards, and applied to
you in consequence?”</p>

<p>“He come round to my house, sir, jest as me and
my missus was a sitting down to dinner,” answered
Mr. Chubbley. “It was biled pork and greens we
had, I remember; cos says I to my missus, says I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well, Mr. Chubbley,” interrupted the counsel:
“we will proceed, if you please. The Insolvent
came round to you, and enquired about the chapel
that was to let?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;he did: and he axed a many ke-vestions
about the orgin and the pulpit, and the westry&mdash;and
so on.”</p>

<p>“And, being satisfied with your replies, he agreed
to take the chapel?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and to pay a ke-varter in adwance, which
was eleven pound ten,” answered Mr. Chubbley.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what took place next?” inquired one of the
Commissioners, growing impatient, while his brother-judge
took a nap.</p>

<p>“Please, my lud, he sits down and pitches into the
biled pork and greens,” responded the opposing creditor.</p>

<p>There was a laugh amongst the audience; but as
the joke did not arise from either the bench or the
bar, the ushers bawled out “Silence!” as loudly as
they could.</p>

<p>“The Insolvent, I believe, not only omitted to pay
the quarter in advance,” said Mr. Bulliwell, “but
succeeded in obtaining from you the loan of forty
pounds?”</p>

<p>“In hard cash&mdash;and that’s what aggerewates me
and my missus so agin him,” replied the opposing
creditor.</p>

<p>“But in what manner did he obtain those forty
pounds?” asked Mr. Bulliwell. “Tell the learned
Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Vy&mdash;one on ’em’s asleep&mdash;and so it’s no use
a-speaking to he!” exclaimed Mr. Chubbley.</p>

<p>There was another laugh, which the clerks and
ushers immediately suppressed; and Captain O’Blunderbuss
ran a narrow risk of being ignominiously
bundled out of the Court for observing in a tone somewhat
above a whisper, “Be Jasus! and that’s as thrue
as that every rale Irishman loves potheen!” But the
best of the business was that the somnolent Commissioner
woke up; and catching the fag end of a laugh
accompanied by the loud cries of “Silence!” on the
part of the officials of the Court, he immediately fancied
that some person had perpetrated a great breach of decorum,
and exclaimed in a severe tone, “Whoever is
the cause of disturbance must be turned out.” Hereupon
there was another laugh; and even Mr. Bulliwell
himself was compelled to stoop down and pretend to
examine his brief in order to conceal the mobility of
his risible muscles.</p>

<p>“Come, come&mdash;let the business proceed,” said Commissioner
Sneesby, anxious to relieve his brother-functionary
from any farther embarrassment; for the
latter learned gentleman was quite bewildered by the
renewed hilarity which his words had provoked.</p>

<p>“Tell the bench how the Insolvent obtained from
you the forty pounds, Mr. Chubbley,” exclaimed Mr.
Bulliwell.</p>

<p>“Please, sir&mdash;my missus has on’y got von eye&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;and what has that to do with it?” demanded
Mr. Commissioner Sneesby.</p>

<p>“Jest this, my lud&mdash;that that ’ere sneaking feller
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
got on the blind side of she, and began a pitching into
she all kind of gammon,&mdash;calling his-self a chosen
wessel, and telling her how she would be sartain sure
of going to heaven if we on’y let him have the funds
to set up in business as a preacher. He swore that all
the airistocracy was a-dying to hear him in the pulpit:
and so he persuades my missus to be pew-opener; and
he gammons me to call myself a Helder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A what?” exclaimed Commissioner Sneesby.</p>

<p>“An Elder, sir,” observed Mr. Bulliwell: for it is
to be remarked that when Judges at Westminster or
Commissioners in Portugal Street cannot understand
any thing&mdash;or affect not to do so&mdash;the counsel are
always prepared to give them an explanation;&mdash;yet
when these counsel become Judges or Commissioners
in their turn, they grow just as opaque of intellect and
as slow of comprehension as those whom they were
once accustomed to enlighten.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;go on, man,” said Commissioner Sneesby,
addressing himself to the opposing creditor.</p>

<p>“Well, my lud,” proceeded Mr. Chubbley, “that
there sniggering feller come over us all in sich a vay
vith his blessed insinivations, that we all thought him
a perfect saint; and we was glad to vipe off the dust
of sich a man’s shoes, as the sayin’ is. So I goes to
my friend Cheesewright, the grocer, and I says, says I,
‘Cheesey, my boy, you must be a Helder, too.’ So
Cheesewright axes what a Helder is; and when I tells
him that it’s to purside over a chapel in which a reglar
saint holds forth, and that all Helders is booked for the
right place in t’other world, he says, says he, ‘Chubbley,
my boy, tip us your fist; and I’m your man for a
Helder too.’”</p>

<p>“And now tell the learned Commissioners what this
business has to do with your opposition to the Insolvent’s
discharge,” said Mr. Bulliwell, seeing that the
bench was growing impatient.</p>

<p>“Vy, my luds,” continued Chubbley, scratching his
head, “that there insinivating chap gets Cheesey to
lend him his acceptance for thirty pounds, and he
comes to me and gets me to write my name along the
back on it&mdash;and so he gets it discounted, and leaves us
to pay it.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Joshua Sheepshanks held up his hands
and groaned aloud&mdash;as if in horrified dismay at the
construction put upon his conduct.</p>

<p>“Silence, Insolvent!” exclaimed the usher, ferociously.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Chubbley,” resumed Mr. Bulliwell,
“what answer did you obtain from the Insolvent when
you stated to him that you had heard certain reports
which made you anxious to receive security for the
rent of the chapel, the forty pounds, and the amount
of the bill for which you were liable?”</p>

<p>“He said as how that the chapel hadn’t succeeded
as he thought it would have done&mdash;that he’d been
disappinted&mdash;and that me and Cheesewright must
have patience.”</p>

<p>“And when you told him that you and Mr. Cheesewright
would not wait any longer&mdash;what did he say?”</p>

<p>“He said we was a generation of wipers.”</p>

<p>“And when you put him into prison?”</p>

<p>“He sent for me, and said I mustn’t hope to be
paid in this world; but as I’d laid up for myself a
treasure in heaven, he expected me to let him out of
quod for nothink.”</p>

<p>There was a general titter in which bench and bar
joined; and the only demure countenances present
were those of the creditor who was done, and Mr.
Sheepshanks who had done him. In fact this pious
gentleman was so overcome by the unpleasantness of
his position, that he compared himself, in the religious
anguish of his spirit, to the man who went down to
Jericho and fell amongst thieves.</p>

<p>Silence being again restored, two other opposing
creditors were examined in their turn; and their evidence
went to prove that Mr. Joshua Sheepshanks had
obtained from them a quantity of goods under such
very questionable pretences, that he might think himself
exceedingly fortunate in having been sent to the
King’s Bench instead of to Newgate.</p>

<p>The opposition having arrived at this stage, Mr.
Bulliwell proceeded to address the Court in a long and
furious speech based upon the testimony that had been
given against the Insolvent. The agreeable appellations
of “sanctimonious hypocrite,” “double-faced
ranter,” “unprincipled trader in pious duplicities,” and
such like terms, were freely applied to Mr. Joshua
Sheepshanks in the course of this oration. The learned
gentleman dwelt bitterly&mdash;but not one atom more
severely than the subject deserved&mdash;upon the rascally
scoundrelism which is practised by those persons who
are denominated “saints;” and he concluded a rather
eloquent speech by praying the Court to express its
sense of the Insolvent’s criminality by remanding him
for as long a period as the Act of Parliament would
allow.</p>

<p>When called upon for any thing he might have to
say in his defence, Mr. Sheepshanks applied a white
handkerchief to his eyes; and, after shaking his head
solemnly for several moments, he revealed his lugubrious
countenance once more&mdash;purposely elongating
it until he fancied he had tortured himself into as
impressive a pitch of misery as one could wish to behold.
He then began a tedious and doleful dissertation
upon the “vanity of earthly things”&mdash;marvelled
that his opposing creditors should “prefer the filthy
lucre to the welfare of their immortal souls”&mdash;declared
that when he first went amongst them he found them
“lamentably benighted,” but that he had “at one
time brought them to a state of grace”&mdash;complained
that they had treated him as if he had been “a vessel
of wrath,” whereas he flattered himself that he was in
“a most savoury state of godliness”&mdash;hinted rather
significantly that he looked upon his present predicament
as a “glorious martyrdom in the good cause”&mdash;and
wound up with an earnest prayer to the Commissioners
that they would not be “moved by the men
of Belial against him,” but that even as “heaven
tempered the wind to the shorn lamb,” they would
modify their judgment according to his lamentable
condition.</p>

<p>To this speech, delivered in the most approved nasal
twang of the dissenting pulpit, and with many doleful
moans and frightful contortions, Commissioner Sneesby
listened with exemplary patience: so, indeed, did his
learned brother-judge&mdash;but in this latter case it was
with the eyes shut. The moment, however, the
harangue was brought to an end, the eyes alluded to
opened slowly and gazed rather vacantly around: but
with judicial keenness, they speedily comprehended the
exact stage of the proceedings; and the possessor of
the sleepy optics forthwith began to consult with his
coadjutor in solemn whispers. Their conversation ran
somewhat in the ensuing manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is getting on for one o’clock, and I begin to feel
quite faint,” said the somniferous Commissioner.</p>

<p>“A chop and a glass of sherry will do us each good,”
observed Mr. Sneesby.</p>

<p>“Bulliwell does make such long-winded speeches!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>“Well&mdash;so he does: but I always pretend to listen
to them&mdash;and thus he enjoys the reputation of having
<em>the ear of the Court</em>.”</p>

<p>“I am going to dine with Serjeant Splutterby this
evening&mdash;and so I shall leave at about four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Commissioner Sneesby. “I
shall sit till six. But what are we to do with this
canting hypocrite of an Insolvent?”</p>

<p>“Six months, I suppose: he is a dreadful villain.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and while you were asleep he made a frightful
long speech&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! in that case, then, let us give him a twelvemonth&mdash;and
then for the chops and the sherry.”</p>

<p>“Good: a twelvemonth&mdash;and then the chops and
the sherry.”</p>

<p>Mr. Commissioner Sneesby, having thus assented to
the suggestions of his sleepy coadjutor, turned in a
solemn manner towards Mr. Joshua Sheepshanks and
addressed that miserable-looking creature in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Insolvent, the Court has maturely deliberated
upon your case. We have listened with deep attention
to the evidence of the opposing creditors and the
address of the learned counsel on their behalf. We
have likewise followed you with equal care throughout
your defence; and we feel ourselves bound to pronounce
an adverse judgment. Your conduct has been
most reprehensible&mdash;aggravated, too, by the fact that
your offences have been committed under the cloak
of religion. My learned brother agrees with me in
the opinion that your proceedings have been most
fraudulent. We might even use harsher terms; but
we will forbear. The judgment of the Court is that
you, Joshua Sheepshanks, be remanded at the suit of
your three opposing creditors for the period of twelve
calendar months from the date of your vesting order.”</p>

<p>“Stand down, Insolvent!” cried the clerk.</p>

<p>The discomfitted Mr. Sheepshanks raised his eyes
and hands upwards, and gave vent to a hollow groan,
which made the audience think for a moment that it
was a ghost from the tomb who was passing through
the Insolvents’ Court.</p>

<p>“Silence, Insolvent!” vociferated an official, making
much more noise to enforce his command than the
pious gentleman did in provoking the injunction.</p>

<p>“You must swear to your schedule,” said the usher,
as Mr. Sheepshanks was descending from the box.</p>

<p>“Damn the schedule!” muttered the reverend Insolvent,
in a savage whisper.</p>

<p>“What do you say?” demanded the usher.</p>

<p>“I pray to heaven to have mercy upon my relentless
persecutors, even as I forgive them!” answered Mr.
Sheepshanks, with a solemn shake of the head.</p>

<p>He then quitted the box, and forthwith accompanied
the tipstaff who had charge of him to the public-house
opposite, where he drowned his cares in such a quantity
of hot brandy-and-water, that the tipstaff aforesaid
was compelled to put him into a cab and convey him
back to the King’s Bench in a desperate state of intoxication.</p>

<p>In the meantime the two Commissioners retired to
partake of their chops and sherry: the learned counsel
likewise withdrew to <em>their</em> private room, where <em>they</em>
also refreshed themselves;&mdash;the attorneys stole away
for a quarter of an hour:&mdash;and the audience took little
portable dinners of saveloys and biscuits from their
pocket-handkerchiefs, so that the compartment of the
Court allotted to spectators suddenly appeared to have
been transformed into a slap-bang shop on an inferior
scale.</p>

<p>The fifteen minutes’ grace having expired, Commissioners,
counsel, and lawyers returned to their
places&mdash;the audience wiped their mouths&mdash;and the
Clerk of the Court called forth the name of “<span class="smcap">Francis
Curtis</span>!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXIX">CHAPTER CXIX.<br />

<span class="medium">THE EXAMINATION OF MR. FRANK CURTIS.</span></h2>

<p>Captain O’Blunderbuss surveyed his friend with a
degree of admiration amounting almost to envy, as the
latter leapt nimbly into the box; but when the two
Commissioners inflicted upon the Insolvent the simultaneous
long stare which seemed to form a portion of
the judicial proceedings, the gallant officer fixed upon
those learned functionaries a look of the most ferocious
menace,&mdash;muttering at the same time something about
the “punching of heads.” As for Mr. Frank Curtis,
he returned the stare of the Commissioners in so deliberately
impudent and yet good-humoured a manner
that it was quite evident the physiognomical discrimination
of the bench was at least for once completely
set at naught. In plain terms, the Commissioners did
not know what the deuce to make of the young
gentleman.</p>

<p>“I appear for the Insolvent, sir,” said one of the
learned counsel, Mr. Cadgerbreef by name.</p>

<p>“And I attend for an opposing creditor, sir,” observed
Mr. Bulliwell.</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Court handed up the schedule to
the Commissioners, who occupied some minutes in
looking over it, the document being somewhat a
lengthy one.</p>

<p>“I see you have got upwards of a hundred and fifty
creditors, Insolvent,” said Mr. Commissioner Sneesby,
fixing his eyes severely upon the youthful candidate
for the process of white-washing.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and my frind’s a jintleman&mdash;every
inch of him!” cried Captain O’Blunderbuss: “and
no jintleman could think of petitioning the Court with
less than a hunthred and fifty creditors.”</p>

<p>The whole Court was struck with dismay&mdash;the bench
being perfectly aghast&mdash;at this interruption; while
the captain stood as dauntless and menacing as if he
seriously contemplated the challenging of Commissioners,
learned counsel, lawyers, and all. Even the
usher was so astounded by his conduct that he forgot
to bawl out his usual noisy cry for silence.</p>

<p>“Who is this person?” enquired Mr. Commissioner
Sneesby, turning towards his brother-judge, as if the
latter knew any better than himself.</p>

<p>“<em>Person</em>, be Jasus! Don’t call me <em>a person</em>,” vociferated
the gallant gentleman, stamping his martial foot
heavily upon the floor. “Is it me name ye’d be
afther finding out? If so, I’ll hand ye my car-r-d&mdash;and
you’ll find that I’m Capthain O’Bluntherbuss,
of Bluntherbuss Park, Connemar-r-ra, Ir-r-reland!”
added the Insolvent’s bosom-friend, rattling the r in
such an appalling manner that it seemed as if a
waggon laden with iron bars was passing through the
Court.</p>

<p>“Turn him out!” exclaimed Mr. Commissioner
Sneesby.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and it’ll take tin of ye to do that!”
ejaculated the captain, taking so firm and dauntless a
stand that he appeared literally nailed to the ground.
“But we’ll make a compromise, if ye plaze&mdash;and
that is, I’ll hould my tongue.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<div id="i_033" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“You had better, sir,” said the Commissioner: then,
perceiving that none of the officials seemed inclined to
assail the impregnable front which the ferocious Irishman
presented, he thought it prudent to pass over the
interruption and continue the business before the
Court. “Who attends to oppose?” he accordingly
demanded.</p>

<p>“Me!” ejaculated a little, dapper-looking, flashily-dressed
person, elbowing his way through the crowd
behind the barristers’ seats, and getting his glossy
beaver smashed flat as an opera hat in the desperate
struggle: indeed, what with the smell of onions from
one man and tobacco from another,&mdash;what with the
squeezing, and pushing, and crushing&mdash;the treading
on toes, and the danger of having one’s coat slit up
the back or one’s pocket picked,&mdash;it is no easy nor
pleasant matter to transform oneself into a human
wedge to be applied to such a stubborn, compact mass
as a multitude in a Court of Justice.</p>

<p>At last, however, the little man succeeded in reaching
the witness-box,&mdash;but not without being compelled
to smart under the disagreeable conviction that the
studied elegance of his toilette was entirely marred&mdash;his
shirt-frill tumbled, his white waistcoat soiled
through contact with a coal-heaver, and all the polish
trodden off his boots.</p>

<p>Adjusting himself as well as he could in the box, he
made a profound bow to the bench, simpered in a familiar
fashion towards his counsel, glanced complacently
at the attorneys, and then turned a look of indignant
contempt upon the Insolvent,&mdash;so that the little gentleman’s
transitions from excruciating politeness to extreme
hauteur were very interesting indeed.</p>

<p>“Your name is Kicksey Fopperton, I believe?”
said Mr. Bulliwell, the opposing creditor’s own counsel,
specially retained and fee’d for the purpose of
getting Mr. Frank Curtis remanded during as lengthened
a period as possible.</p>

<p>“That is my name, sir,” was the answer, delivered
with a bland smile and a half bow.</p>

<p>“What are you, Mr. Fopperton?”</p>

<p>“A tailor by trade, sir;”&mdash;for persons of Mr. Fopperton’s
calling never describe themselves briefly as
“tailors,” but always as “tailors by trade.”</p>

<p>“A tailor by trade,” repeated Mr. Bulliwell. “And
you carry on business&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In Regent Street, sir,” replied Mr. Fopperton,
glancing towards the bench to notice what effect such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
a fashionable address had produced upon the Commissioners:
but one was dozing, and the other seemed to
be looking at nothing&mdash;just as horses appear when
they are standing idle.</p>

<p>“In Regent Street,” repeated Mr. Bulliwell. “And
I believe the Insolvent called upon you, and ordered
clothes to a considerable amount?”</p>

<p>“I have supplied him for the last three years,”
answered Mr. Fopperton, “and never yet saw the
colour of his money.”</p>

<p>“You never yet saw the colour of his money. But
he has seen the colour of yours, though?”</p>

<p>“I have discounted bills for him to the amount of a
thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>“To the amount of a thousand pounds. Now, on
what pretence&mdash;or rather, under what circumstances
did the Insolvent introduce himself to you?” inquired
Mr. Bulliwell.</p>

<p>“He drove up to my door in a dashing gig, sir,”
answered Mr. Fopperton, “leapt down, rushed in, and
enquired if his friend the Archbishop of Canterbury
had been waiting there for him? I assured him that
his Grace had not visited the shop, to my knowledge,
in all his life. ‘<em>God bless me!</em>’ exclaimed Mr. Curtis;
‘<em>I must have made a mistake, then! But don’t you
make the leather breeches which his Grace wears when
he goes out hunting?</em>’ I replied that I never made
leather breeches at all. ‘<em>Nor galligaskins?</em>’ said Mr.
Curtis. ‘<em>Nor galligaskins, sir</em>,’ I said. ‘<em>Then blow me
tight</em>’ says he, ‘<em>I have come to the wrong shop. My
intimate and particular friend the Archbishop of
York</em>&mdash;&mdash;’. I suggested ‘<em>Canterbury</em>,’&mdash;‘<em>Canterbury
I meant!</em>’ exclaimed Mr. Curtis: ‘<em>his Grace promised
to introduce me to his own tailor; and here have I
been promising introductions likewise to Lord Pumpleby
and the Marquis of Dublin, and a whole lot of
my fashionable friends. There is a perfect rage all on
a sudden to employ his Grace’s tailor!</em>’&mdash;I was struck
by all this fine-sounding talk, and handed Mr. Curtis
my card. ‘<em>Egad!</em>’ said he, laughing, ‘<em>I’ve a precious
good mind to have a lark, and pit you against his
Grace’s tailor. My eyes! what fun it would be!</em>’”</p>

<p>“And it ended by the Insolvent actually putting
you in competition with the imaginary tailor which
he had conjured up?” enquired Mr. Bulliwell.</p>

<p>“Just so, sir,” returned Mr. Fopperton “and though
I heard sometime afterwards that Mr. Curtis received
a handsome income from his uncle Sir Christopher
Blunt, yet I never got a sixpence.”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! Sir Christopher-r is a regular ould
screw!” ejaculated Captain O’Blunderbuss.</p>

<p>“Eh?&mdash;what?” cried the Commissioners, the one
awaking from his nap and the other from his obliviousness.</p>

<p>“Is it afther distur-r-bing ye I’ve been again?”
demanded the gallant gentleman: “then, be the holy
poker-r! I ask your pardon&mdash;and I’ll hould my pace!”</p>

<p>With these words the captain put his arms akimbo&mdash;pursed
up his mouth in a most extraordinary
fashion&mdash;and stood as still as a post and as demure as
a methodist parson, to the huge delight of the unwashed
audience.</p>

<p>“It appears,” said Mr. Bulliwell, resuming his examination
of the opposing creditor, “that the Insolvent
obtained clothes to the amount of four hundred pounds,
and cash to the amount of a thousand?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fopperton bowed an assent.</p>

<p>“And you have every reason to believe that he only
talked about the Archbishop’s tailor and his noble
acquaintances, in order to throw dust into your eyes?”</p>

<p>“To make a fool of me, sir,” cried Mr. Kicksey
Fopperton.</p>

<p>“To make a fool of you,” repeated Mr. Bulliwell.</p>

<p>“And an ass of me, sir!” ejaculated the tailor, with
increasing warmth.</p>

<p>“And an ass of you,” echoed the learned counsel.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;and to make a stupid old owl of me!”
vociferated Mr. Fopperton.</p>

<p>“A stupid old owl of you,” still repeated Mr. Bulliwell,
in the most matter-of-fact style possible: then,
perceiving that his client had exhausted alike his self-reproaching
epithets and his breath, the learned counsel
sate down.</p>

<p>Thereupon up rose Mr. Cadgerbreef, who had been
retained for the defence of the Insolvent; and as he
pulled his gown over his shoulders and prepared to
cross-examine the opposing creditor, Captain O’Blunderbuss
turned partially round, and forming an arch
with his hand on one side of his mouth, said, in a
pretty loud tone however, “Be Jasus! and if ye don’t
make mince mate of him, it’s meself that’ll skin him
alive!”</p>

<p>The learned counsel nodded his head in a significant
manner, as much as to say, “Just wait a moment&mdash;and
you shall see how I’ll serve him;”&mdash;and the gallant
captain appeared satisfied with the tacit promise
thus conveyed.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Fopperton,” cried Mr. Cadgerbreef, who
was considered to be particularly skilful in badgering
and baiting an opposing creditor, “you’ll be so kind
as to remember that you are upon your oath:” and the
learned counsel glanced towards the bench, as much
as to intimate that the Commissioners were keeping a
sharp look out on him, the opposing creditor aforesaid,
and would send him to Newgate without remorse at
the least symptom of perjury that might transpire.</p>

<p>Mr. Fopperton cast his eyes timidly in the same
direction; and it was no doubt some satisfaction to
him to observe that the sleepy Commissioner <em>was</em> fast
asleep, and that the other was just going off into a
doze.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Fopperton,” exclaimed Mr. Cadgerbreef,
in a very loud and very overbearing tone, “so you have
come to oppose the Insolvent’s discharge&mdash;have you?
Now answer me this question: have you ever been in
that box yourself?” pointing at the same time in a
resolute and determined manner towards the place
occupied by Mr. Curtis.</p>

<p>“Am I bound to answer that question?” asked Mr.
Fopperton, becoming considerably crest-fallen all on a
sudden, and appealing meekly to his own counsel.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you must,” returned Mr. Bulliwell.</p>

<p>“Well, then,sir&mdash;I have had the misfortune to pass
through this Court,” said the fashionable tailor, his
countenance growing excessively blank.</p>

<p>“You <em>have</em> been insolvent,” exclaimed Mr. Cadgerbreef.
“Now, sir, how often have you petitioned the
Court and been discharged from your liabilities through
the proceedings of this Court?”</p>

<p>“Really, sir&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” stammered the West-End
tailor, becoming awfully red in the face.</p>

<p>“Shall I repeat the question, sir?” demanded the
learned counsel, affecting a politeness that was even
more galling than his severity had been.</p>

<p>“You had better answer, Mr. Fopperton,” said Mr.
Bulliwell.</p>

<p>“I can’t say&mdash;that is&mdash;not exactly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! very well&mdash;then we shall see!” cried Mr.
Cadgerbreef, taking up a pen, dipping it deep into the
ink, and making believe that he was about to take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
down the answers to be given to his questions&mdash;so as
to catch the opposing creditor out perjuring himself
if possible: “will you swear, Mr. Fopperton, that you
have not been insolvent seven times?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;I <em>will</em> swear to that,” returned the tailor
with alacrity.</p>

<p>“You will swear. Well&mdash;will you swear that you
have not been insolvent five times?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;I will swear to that too.”</p>

<p>“You will swear to that, too. Now mind what
you’re about, Mr. Fopperton: take care what you say,”
cried Mr. Cadgerbreef, in a tone of awful menace.
“Will you swear that you have not been insolvent
three times?”</p>

<p>“No, sir&mdash;I&mdash;I can’t swear to that,” answered the
tailor, looking very miserable.</p>

<p>“You can’t swear to that. Now, can you deny it?”
“No, sir&mdash;I cannot,” said Mr. Fopperton.</p>

<p>“You cannot,” repeated Mr. Cadgerbreef, casting a
glance at Captain O’Blunderbuss, which seemed to say,
“I have him now!”&mdash;then, again addressing himself
to the opposing creditor, he exclaimed in a domineering,
browbeating manner, “Take care what you are
about, Mr. Fopperton;&mdash;and now tell me whether you
have not been bankrupt, as well as insolvent, several
times.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;only once bankrupt,” cried Mr. Fopperton,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;once bankrupt&mdash;and enough too, when
coupled with three insolvencies!” said the learned
gentleman, in a tone which very significantly implied
his belief that the opposing creditor was the greatest
scoundrel in the universe. “And pray how much
have you ever paid in the shape of dividend, sir?”</p>

<p>“I really can’t say at this moment: I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! you can’t&mdash;can’t you!” cried Mr. Cadgerbreef:
“then I’ll see if I can refresh your memory;”&mdash;and,
taking out of his pocket a letter from some friend
or relation, he pretended to examine it with very great
attention, as if it contained some damning testimony
relative to Mr. Fopperton’s dealings&mdash;although, in
reality, it had no more connexion with him or his
affairs than with the man in the moon.</p>

<p>“I think I recollect now, sir,” said the West-End
tailor, getting frightened: “I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, sir&mdash;can you answer my question?” demanded
Mr. Cadgerbreef, laying his fore-finger on the
letter in a marked and formal manner, just as if he
were pointing to the very paragraph which furnished
all requisite information respecting the tailor. “I
will repeat it again for you: how much have you ever
paid, collectively and under all your numerous insolvencies
and frequent bankruptcies, in the shape of
dividend?”</p>

<p>“Two-pence three farthings in the pound, sir,” answered
Mr. Fopperton, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Speak out, sir!” vociferated the learned counsel,
although he heard perfectly well what had been said.
“Two-pence three farthings in the pound,” exclaimed
the unfortunate Snip, who already repented
most bitterly that, by coming to oppose Mr. Frank
Curtis, he had fallen into the hands of Mr. Cadgerbreef.</p>

<p>“Two-pence three farthings in the pound,” repeated
this learned gentleman, tossing up his head as if in
unmitigated abhorrence at such awful villainy. “And
pray, sir, what was the aggregate of liabilities under
all your innumerable insolvencies and your equally
numberless bankruptcies?”</p>

<p>“I never was bankrupt more than once, sir,” mournfully
and imploringly remonstrated the tailor, now
worked up to a frightful pitch of nervousness and
misery.</p>

<p>“Don’t shirk my question, sir!” exclaimed the barrister,
sternly. “How much did all your liabilities&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thirty thousand pounds, sir,” hastily cried Mr.
Fopperton, anticipating the repetition of the query on
the part of the learned gentleman.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and he’s a complete villain!” said
Captain O’Blunderbuss, in such a loud tone that both
the Commissioners woke up: whereupon the gallant
officer affected to be seized with a sudden inclination
to gaze up abstractedly at the sky-light, just for all
the world as if he were quite innocent of any fresh interruption.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Fopperton,” exclaimed Mr. Cadgerbreef,
seeing that the Commissioners were all attention just
at this moment, and taking a skilful advantage of
the circumstance, “under your numerous insolvencies
and frequent bankruptcies&mdash;don’t interrupt me, sir&mdash;you
have paid two-pence three farthings in the pound,
on aggregate liabilities amounting to thirty thousand
pounds. The Court will be pleased to notice these
facts. And yet, Mr. Fopperton, we find you discounting
a thousand pounds’ worth of bills for my client,
the Insolvent. The Court will again please to take a
note of this fact.”</p>

<p>Of course the Commissioners could not help making&mdash;or
at least affecting to make the memoranda suggested
by the learned counsel: so the sleepy one
scrawled a zig-zag line across his note-book, and
the other hit off a rapid sketch of Captain O’Blunderbuss’s
face, Mr. Commissioner Sneesby being very proficient
in that style of drawing. The two functionaries
then laid down their pens, and looked as solemn
and serious as if they had actually and positively
taken the notes in the most business-like manner
possible.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” continued Mr. Cadgerbreef, once more
turning to the opposing creditor, “will you tell the
Court how much hard cash you gave the Insolvent for
his acceptance of one thousand pounds?”</p>

<p>“Really, sir, the occurrence is so long ago&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will you swear, man, that you gave him two
hundred pounds?” demanded the learned counsel, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;I will,” was the instantaneous answer.</p>

<p>“Will you swear that you gave him four hundred?”&mdash;and
Mr. Cadgerbreef dipped his pen into the ink
with an air of awful determination.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;no&mdash;I can’t exactly&mdash;&mdash;” stammered the
tailor, every instant becoming more and more nervous.</p>

<p>“Will you swear that you gave him three hundred
and twenty pounds in hard cash for that bill?” demanded
Mr. Cadgerbreef.</p>

<p>“That was just what I did pay in money,” replied
Mr. Fopperton, in a hesitating manner.</p>

<p>“That was just what you did pay. Now tell the
earned Commissioners what else you gave the Insolvent
for that bill.”</p>

<p>“There was three hundred and twenty in cash&mdash;and
four hundred and twenty in wines, pictures, and
other objects of value&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come&mdash;that only gives us seven hundred and
forty,” cried the barrister: “how do you make up the
rest?”</p>

<p>“A hundred pounds <em>discount</em>, sir&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A hundred pounds discount. Well&mdash;what next?”</p>

<p>“Sixty pounds <em>commission</em>, sir&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>“Sixty pounds commission. You have still another
hundred to account for, Mr. Fopperton,” said the
learned counsel, sharply. “Come&mdash;about that other
hundred? and mind what you tell the Commissioners.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir&mdash;the hundred pounds was for <em>bonus</em>,”
answered the fashionable tailor.</p>

<p>“That will do, sir: you may stand down,” said Mr.
Cadgerbreef, looking significantly at the learned Commissioners,
with a view of impressing it on their minds
that he had just succeeded in fully unmasking a most
awful rogue.</p>

<p>Mr. Bulliwell now rose and made a very furious
speech against the Insolvent; so that a stranger unacquainted
with the practice of English Courts of Justice,
would have fancied that the learned counsel had
some bitter and deadly motive of personal hatred
against the young gentleman;&mdash;whereas all that apparent
venom&mdash;that seeming spite&mdash;that assumed virulence&mdash;and
that fierce eloquence were purchased by
Mr. Kicksey Fopperton for a couple of guineas. The
speech was cheap&mdash;yes, very cheap, when we take
into consideration the almost excruciating pains that
the learned gentleman took to get Frank Curtis remanded
to prison for six months. So much perspiration&mdash;such
frantic gesticulation&mdash;and such impassioned
declamation were well worth the money; and
if it did Mr. Bulliwell good to earn his two guineas on
such terms, it must have been equally satisfactory to
Mr. Kicksey Fopperton to obtain so good a two
guineas’ worth.</p>

<p>During the delivery of this oration, Captain O’Blunderbuss
could scarcely contain his fury: as insulting
epithet after epithet poured from the lips of Mr. Bulliwell,
who was always more eloquent when conducting
an opposition than when arguing a defence, the gallant
Irishman literally foamed at the mouth;&mdash;and it was
only in the hope of Mr. Cadgerbreef’s ability to mend
the business, that he succeeded in controlling his passion.
At length Mr. Bulliwell sate down; and the
captain muttered in a pretty audible tone, “Blood and
thunther! he shall repint of this as long as he lives, if
my frind is sent back to the Binch!”</p>

<p>Mr. Cadgerbreef rose to defend his client, Frank
Curtis; and as the best means of making that young
gentleman appear white was to represent the opposing
creditor as particularly black, the learned counsel forthwith
began to depict Mr. Kicksey Fopperton’s character
in such sable dyes that the unfortunate tailor soon
found himself held up to execration as a species of
moral blackamoor. In fact, the poor little man was
stunned&mdash;astounded&mdash;paralysed by the vituperative
eloquence of Mr. Cadgerbreef; and as the learned
counsel proceeded to denounce his “numerous insolvencies”
and “his frequent bankruptcies” as proofs of
unmitigated depravity,&mdash;as he dwelt upon the features
of the bill-transaction, and spoke with loathing of the
<em>discount</em>, with disgust of the <em>commission</em>, and with
perfect horror of the <em>bonus</em>,&mdash;Mr. Fopperton began to
say to himself, “Well, upon my word, I begin to fear
that I am indeed a most unprincipled scoundrel: but
the fact was never brought home to me so forcibly
before!”</p>

<p>In the meantime Captain O’Blunderbuss was in perfect
ecstacies: he forgot all that Mr. Bulliwell had said,
in listening to the counter-declamation of Mr. Cadgerbreef;&mdash;and
his delight was expressed in frequent
ejaculatory outbursts, such as “Be Jasus, and there ye
have him!” but which passed comparatively unnoticed
amidst the thundering din of the learned counsel’s
torrent of words. As for Mr. Frank Curtis, he had
cared little for the violent assault made upon him by
Mr. Bulliwell; but he was immensely pleased at the
slaughterous attack effected by Mr. Cadgerbreef on the
dismayed and horrified tailor.</p>

<p>The defence being concluded, the two learned Commissioners
consulted with each other in whispers; and
when they had exchanged a few remarks having no
more reference to the case before them than to the
affairs of the Chinese Empire, Mr. Commissioner
Sneesby proceeded to deliver the judgment of the
Court.</p>

<p>Looking as awfully solemn as possible, he said, “Insolvent,
it is perfectly clear that you have run a career
of extravagance and folly which must be summarily
checked. While enjoying a handsome allowance from
your worthy uncle, you contracted numerous debts in
a most reckless manner; and it is probable that Sir
Christopher Blunt withdrew that allowance in consequence
of your spendthrift habits. Insolvent, the
Court is of opinion that you cannot be allowed your
freedom again until you shall have passed a certain
time in confinement, both as a punishment for the
past and as a warning for the future. The judgment
of the Court is, therefore, that you be remanded at
the suit of your opposing creditor, Mr. Fopperton, for
the space of five calendar months from the date of
your vesting order.”</p>

<p>“Thin bad luck to ye, ye slapy-headed ould scoundrels!”
vociferated Captain O’Blunderbuss.</p>

<p>“Holloa, there!” cried the usher, unable to pass
over such a flagrant breach of decorum as this, in spite
of the awe with which the terrible Irishman inspired
him; and, springing towards the captain, the official
clutched him by the collar&mdash;while, to use the words
of the newspaper reporter, “the most tremendous
sensation pervaded the Court.”</p>

<p>But Gorman O’Blunderbuss was not the man to be
thus assailed with impunity; and, knocking down the
usher with one hand and Mr. Kicksey Fopperton on
the top of him with the other, he made a desperate
rush from the tribunal, no opposition being offered to
his exit.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards he was joined at the
public-house over the way by his friend Frank Curtis
and the tipstaff who had charge of the latter; and the
three worthies, following the example of the pious
Mr. Joshua Sheepshanks, drank spirits-and-water
until they were compelled to return to the King’s
Bench in a hackney-coach.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXX">CHAPTER CXX.<br />

<span class="medium">THE LAPSE OF NINETEEN YEARS.</span></h2>

<p>How easy is it to record upon paper the sweeping
words&mdash;“Nineteen years had passed away since the
occurrences just related:”&mdash;how easy is it with a few
moments’ manipulation of the pen to leap over a period
embracing almost the fifth part of a century!</p>

<p>Nineteen years!&mdash;a few short syllables&mdash;a drop of
ink&mdash;a scrap of paper&mdash;and a minute’s trouble,&mdash;these
are all that the novelist needs to enable him to pass
by the deeds of nineteen years!</p>

<p>Oh! this very power compels us to look with suspicion
upon the utility of our own avocations,&mdash;to reflect
how far removed from <em>the</em> natural is even the <em>most</em>
natural of the works of fiction,&mdash;and to feel the
nothingness of all the efforts of the imagination when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
placed in contrast with the stern and stubborn facts
of the real world!</p>

<p>For though the novelist, exercising a despotic power
over the offspring of his fancy, may dispose of years&mdash;aye,
even of centuries, with a dash of his pen,&mdash;yet
of Time, as the universe actually experiences its
march, not one instant can he stay&mdash;not one instant
accelerate.</p>

<p>Great Kings, who have proclaimed themselves demigods
and compelled the millions to abase themselves
round their mighty thrones,&mdash;at whose awful nod
whole nations have trembled as if at the frown of
Olympian Jove, and whose impatient stamp on the
marble pavement of their palaces has seemed to shake
the earth to its very centre,&mdash;proud and haughty
monarchs such as these have been powerless in the
hands of Time as infants in the grasp of a Giant.
Though heads would fall at their command, yet not a
hair of their own could they prevent from turning
gray: though at their beck whole provinces were de-populated,
yet not a single moment could they add to
their own lives!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> is a sovereign more potent than all the imperial
rulers that ever wore the Tyrian purple,&mdash;stronger
than the bravest warriors that ever led conquering
armies over desolated lands,&mdash;less easy to be
moved to mercy than the fiercest tyrants that ever
grasped earthly sceptres.</p>

<p>To those who, being in misery, look forward to the
certain happiness that already gleams upon them with
orient flickerings from the distance, Time is slow&mdash;oh!
so slow, that his feet seem heavy with iron weights
and his wings with lead:&mdash;but to those who, being as
yet happy, behold unmistakeable auguries of approaching
affliction, Time is rapid&mdash;oh! so rapid, that his
feet appear to glide glancingly along like those of a
sportive boy in pursuit of a butterfly, and his wings
are as light and buoyant as the fleetest of birds.</p>

<p>The wicked man, stretched upon the bed of death,
cries out, “Oh! for leisure to repent!”&mdash;but Time disregardeth
his agonising prayer, and saith, “Die!”
The invalid, racked with excruciating pains, and
wearied of an existence which knows no relief from
suffering, exclaims, “Oh! that death would snatch
me away!”&mdash;but Time accordeth not the shrieking
aspiration, and saith, “Live on!”</p>

<p>Passionless and without feeling though he be, Time
shows caprices in which the giddiest and most wilful
girl would be ashamed to indulge,&mdash;sparing where he
ought to slay&mdash;slaying where he ought to spare: insensible
to all motives, incompetent to form designs,
he appears to act with a method of contradictions and
on a system of studied irregularities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Nineteen years had passed away since the occurrences
related in the preceding chapters!”&mdash;Such is
the sweeping assertion which we have now to make.</p>

<p>Nineteen years!&mdash;how much joy had been experienced,
how much misery felt, during that interval:
what vast changes had taken place over the
whole earth!</p>

<p>In these islands that period was marked with the
names of three sovereigns:&mdash;George the Fourth&mdash;William
the Fourth&mdash;Victoria.</p>

<p>The debaucheries, vices, and profligacies of George
lessened the value of Monarchy even in the eyes of its
stanchest supporters: the utter incompetency, weakness,
and even downright silliness of William reduced
it to a still greater discount;&mdash;and the accession of
Victoria proclaimed the grand fact that Monarchy is a
farce, since a mere school-girl can be put up as the
throned puppet of the Punch-and-Judy show of
Royalty.</p>

<p>During nineteen years, then, did the value of
Monarchy experience a rapid and signal decline: and,
though it still endures, it is hastening with whirlwind
speed to total annihilation. Men are becoming too
wise to maintain a throne which may either be filled
by a voluptuary, a fool, or a doll: they see something
radically and flagrantly bad in an institution which is
fraught with such frightful contingencies;&mdash;and they
look forward to a convenient moment and a proper
opportunity to effect, by moral means, and without
violence, a complete change. The throne is worm-eaten&mdash;its
velvet is in holes and covered with dust:
and no earthly power can repair the wood nor patch
up the cloth. It is old&mdash;ricketty&mdash;and good-for-nothing;
and the magisterial seat of a President, elected
by the nation at large, must displace it. Monarchy
falling, will drag down the ancient Aristocracy along
with it; and the twenty-six millions of these realms
all starting fair together on a principle of universal
equality, those who succeed in reaching the goals of
<span class="smcap">Virtue</span> and <span class="smcap">Talent</span> will constitute and form a new
Aristocracy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nineteen years had passed away since the occurrences
related in the preceding chapters; and it was
now the summer of 1846.</p>

<p>The July sun gave forth a heat of intense sultriness;
and not a breath of air fanned the stifling streets of
the West-End, nor agitated the green foliage of St.
James’s Park. Nevertheless all that fashionable quarter
of London which lies within the immediate vicinity
of the old palace that gives its name to the park just
mentioned, presented a bustling and animated appearance;
for Queen Victoria was to hold a grand reception
at noon that day.</p>

<p>Pall Mall was thronged with well-dressed persons
of both sexes;&mdash;and the windows and balconies in
that thoroughfare were crowded with elegantly-attired
ladies and gentlemen, who were either the occupants
of the houses at the casements of which they were
thus stationed, or had hired seats at the shops where
the cupidity of the proprietors turned to advantage the
curiosity of the public.</p>

<p>It was evident, then, that the reception to be holden
this day was of no ordinary character, and that some
great or illustrious personage was expected to attend
the royal levee. For, amongst the thousands that
thronged the streets, an immense anxiety to secure
the best places prevailed; and in all quarters was the
eager question asked&mdash;“But is it certain that the Prince
will come this way?”</p>

<p>We must pause for a few minutes to notice a group
occupying the balcony of the drawing-room windows
at the mansion of the Earl of Ellingham. This group
consisted of six persons&mdash;three gentlemen, and three
ladies.</p>

<p>The first of the three gentlemen was a fine, handsome,
noble-looking man of about forty-five years of
age&mdash;with a countenance indicating feelings of the
most lofty honour, great generosity, and a splendid intellect.
This was the Earl of Ellingham.</p>

<p>Near him stood an old and venerable gentleman,
whose years were verging fast to three-score-and-ten,
but whose small, restless, sparkling eyes beamed with
the fires of genius, and whose compressed lips showed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
that although he had consented to become a spectator
of the gay scene about to take place, his thoughts
frequently wandered to subjects of a more serious kind
and more congenial to his nature. This was Sir John
Lascelles&mdash;the most eminent physician of the age, and
who had received the honour of knighthood in recompense
for the great services which he had rendered to
the art of medicine.</p>

<p>The third gentleman was about twenty-five years of
age. Tall, handsome, well-formed, and genteel in appearance,
he seemed a fit and suitable companion for
the lovely girl who leant upon his arm, and of whom
we shall speak more fully anon. The fine young man
at present alluded to, was called by the name of Charles
Hatfield: but in the former portion of this work he
was known, when a little boy, to the reader as Charley
Watts.</p>

<p>The first of the three ladies was about thirty-seven
years of age; and her beauty, in the finest, chastest,
and most elevated Hebrew style, was admirably preserved.
The lapse of years had only matured her charms,
and not impaired them: time had touched not the
pearly whiteness of her teeth, nor dimmed the brilliant
lustre of her large dark eyes. Her hair was still of the
deepest and glossiest jet,&mdash;silken and luxuriant, as
when we first described it in the fourth chapter of our
narrative:&mdash;for she of whom we are speaking now,
was Esther, Countess of Ellingham.</p>

<p>Conversing with the noble Jewess&mdash;for she clung to
the faith of her forefathers&mdash;was a lady whose style
of beauty was of that magnificent and voluptuous
kind which sets the beholder at naught in his calculations
and conjectures relative to the age of the object
of his admiration;&mdash;for though forty-four years had
passed over the head of Lady Hatfield, she was still
endowed with a loveliness that, though matured,
seemed to have known only the lapse of summers and
never to have passed through the snowy storms of as
many winters.</p>

<p>And now we must speak more in detail of that charming
girl to whom we alluded ere now, and who was
leaning on the arm of Lady Hatfield’s son. Ravishingly
beautiful was this young creature of seventeen&mdash;with
the aquiline countenance of her mother, and
the Saxon complexion of her father. Yes&mdash;lovely indeed
was Lady Frances Ellingham, the only issue of
the alliance which took place between the Earl and
Esther one year after the murder of Tamar, and consequently
eighteen years previous to the period of which
we are now writing. Much of the description which
we gave of Esther in the opening of our tale, would
apply to the charms of her daughter, whose forehead
was high, broad, and intelligent,&mdash;whose mouth was
small, and revealing in smiles teeth white as orient
pearls,&mdash;whose eyes were large and dark,&mdash;and whose
figure was tall, sylph-like, and graceful. But Lady
Frances Ellingham’s hair, though dark, was several
shades less jetty than that of her mother; and her
complexion was delicately clear, with a slight tinge of
rich carnation appearing beneath the dazzling purity
of the skin.</p>

<p>Such was the interesting group of six persons stationed
in the balcony of the Earl of Ellingham’s
mansion. But while they are awaiting the presence of
the illustrious individual who is expected to pass
through Pall Mall to the Queen’s levee at St. James’s
palace, we will place on record a few short facts that
will render less obscure to our readers the interval of
nineteen years over which we have thought fit to leap
in our narrative.</p>

<p>For a long&mdash;long time after the murder of Tamar,
Tom Rain appeared inaccessible to consolation: but
at last his naturally strong mind and vigorous intellect
began to exercise their energies&mdash;the former to
combat against the deep and depressing sense of affliction&mdash;and
the latter to teach him the necessity of
putting forth all his powers in the struggle, not only
on account of the inutility of repinings, but likewise
for the sake of those who were interested in him. It
was, however, chiefly on the occasion of Lord Ellingham’s
marriage with Esther de Medina, that Rainford
perceptibly rallied; for it did his generous heart good
to behold the happiness of his half-brother. As time
wore on, Tom Rain recovered much of his former
cheerfulness; and after the lapse of three years from
the date of Tamar’s death, he began to listen with
attention, if not with interest, to the representations
made to him by the Earl, urging him to the performance
of a duty which it was now in his power to fulfil.
Arthur reminded him of Georgiana Hatfield’s generous
conduct in obtaining the royal pardon,&mdash;he assured
Rainford that her ladyship no longer thought of him
with abhorrence and aversion, but would cheerfully
bestow her hand on the father of her child,&mdash;and the
nobleman moreover advised the alliance on the ground
that the boy would then dwell with both his parents.
The death of Mr. de Medina, which happened about
that time, delayed the negociations thus commenced;
but at the expiration of a year the proposal was revived,
and the necessary arrangements were speedily
adjusted. In fine, it was settled that Rainford should
abandon the name by which he had hitherto been
known, and assume that of Hatfield,&mdash;that the boy
should be thenceforth called in the same manner, but
should be brought up in the belief that he was Rainford’s
nephew,&mdash;and that after the marriage, which
was to be solemnized in the most private manner
possible, the wedded pair should proceed to the continent,
and there reside for some years. All these
arrangements were duly carried out. Rainford&mdash;whom
we shall henceforth call by his wife’s name&mdash;became
the husband of Lady Georgiana Hatfield;&mdash;and,
taking with them their child, who was represented
to be their nephew, they forthwith repaired to
Italy, where they dwelt for nearly fifteen years. Thus,
on their return to London, only a few weeks before the
date up to which we have now brought the incidents
of our tale, all the stirring circumstances once associated
with the name of Tom Rain were pretty well
forgotten; and none, save those few who were in the
secret, suspected that the pleasant, gentlemanly, good-natured
Mr. Hatfield was identical with the individual
who nineteen years previously had filled all England
with his fame.</p>

<p>While we have been thus digressing, the sensation
amongst the crowds in Pall Mall has increased;&mdash;for
the carriages of several eminent or illustrious personages
have passed along in their way to the royal
levee.</p>

<p>In the balcony at the Earl of Ellingham’s drawing-room
window, a degree of curiosity and excitement
prevailed which certainly could not have been aroused
on the part of the intelligent individuals there assembled,
by the mere display of gorgeous equipages. Let
us see whether the conversation passing in that
balcony will throw any light upon the subject.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Sir John Lascelles, almost in a
petulant tone, “I wonder how much longer your
cynosure of attraction will be before he makes his appearance?
Truly, it was worth while for my friend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Ellingham here, to drag me away from my experiments
in order to catch a glimpse of a foreign
Prince&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nay, doctor,” interrupted the Earl, smiling: “It
was precisely because this illustrious Prince is <em>not</em> a
foreigner&mdash;but an Englishman by birth and a true
Briton in his noble heart&mdash;that I thought you would
be pleased to join those who are desirous to behold a
youthful hero whose name occupies so memorable a
page in history.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the physician, somewhat more
mildly: “I will have patience&mdash;and since you assure
us that the object of all curiosity is indeed an Englishman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Surely you can neither doubt the fact, nor be
ignorant of his great achievements, doctor?” exclaimed
the Earl. “But if you wish to receive positive
assurances as to his Royal Highness’s English
parentage, Lady Hatfield will satisfy you.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;truly,” observed Georgiana. “When we
were staying in Italy, we not only became as it were
eye-witnesses of the great Revolution which was conducted
to so signally triumphant an issue by the young
hero of whom you are speaking; but we subsequently
had the honour of forming the acquaintance of his
Royal Highness and that of his Princess, who is as
amiable as she is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“And now that the Prince has come to visit his
native land once more,” said Charles Hatfield, his eyes
flashing the fires of that enthusiasm which filled his
soul, “the people assemble in crowds to do honour to
their illustrious fellow-countryman. Oh! how delicious
must his feelings be, when he reflects that as an
obscure individual he once moved, unnoticed and unknown,
amidst the mazes of this great city,&mdash;and that
by his own brilliant merits he has raised himself to
that pinnacle of rank and glory which renders him the
admiration of the myriads now assembled to welcome
his presence.”</p>

<p>“Well spoken, my dear Charles,” exclaimed Lady
Hatfield. “Look up and down the street&mdash;it is literally
paved and walled with human faces! In the balconies
on either side of this house&mdash;and opposite too&mdash;I
recognise many ladies and peers of the highest rank.
Yes&mdash;Charles, you are right: the feelings of the Prince
must indeed be joyous when he reflects that this vast
congregation of all classes has gathered to do honour
to the fellow-countryman of whom they are so justly
proud.”</p>

<p>“History teems with examples of bold, bad, and
ambitious men usurping power and decorating themselves
with lofty titles,” continued Charles, addressing
himself partly to Lady Hatfield and partly to the
beautiful Lady Frances Ellingham: “but in the present
instance we have a young Englishman, of generous
soul, enlightened opinions, and even rigorous rectitude
of conduct, raising himself from nothing as it were
and acquiring the proudest titular distinctions. For
what a glorious elevation was it from plain <em>Mr. Richard
Markham</em> to <em>His Royal Highness Field-Marshal the
Prince of Montoni, Captain-General of the Castelcicalan
Army, and Heir-Apparent to the Grand-Ducal
Throne</em>!”</p>

<p>Scarcely had Charles Hatfield enunciated these
sounding titles in a tone which afforded full evidence
of the enthusiasm that filled his soul as he thought
of the splendid career of Richard Markham,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> when
far-off shouts of welcome and of joy suddenly reached
the ears of the group on the balcony:&mdash;then those
sounds came nearer and nearer, as the crowd took up
the cries from the direction where they commenced;&mdash;and
never was Royalty saluted with a more cordial
greeting than that which now welcomed the hero of
Castelcicala.</p>

<p>“Long live the Prince of Montoni! God save Richard
Markham!” were the words sent up by thousands and
thousands of voices to the blue arch of heaven.</p>

<p>In a short time a handsome carriage, drawn by four
magnificent horses, came in sight of the spectators in
the balcony; and nothing could now exceed the enthusiasm
of Charles Hatfield, as he once more beheld
the object of his heroic idolatry&mdash;that fine young
Prince whom he had so often admired and envied
when in the vast square of the ducal palace of Montoni
his Royal Highness reviewed the garrison of the
Castelcicalan capital.</p>

<p>The Prince, who was accompanied in his carriage
by two aides-de-camp, wore the uniform of his high
military rank: his breast was covered with Orders;
and in his hand he carried his plumed hat, which he
had removed from his brow through respect to the
generous British public from whom he now received
so enthusiastic a welcome.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness was in the prime and glory of
his manhood. He was thirty years of age: his dark
hair, which he wore rather long and which curled
naturally, enclosed a forehead that appeared to be the
seat of genius of the highest order;&mdash;and his fine
black eyes were bright with the fire of intelligence
and the animation of complete happiness. His magnificent
uniform set off his symmetrical and graceful
figure to its fullest advantage; and he acknowledged
with affability and modest condescension the demonstrations
of joy and welcome which marked his progress.</p>

<p>As his equipage passed opposite the mansion of the
Earl of Ellingham, his eyes were attracted to the
balcony; and, recognising Lady Hatfield and the enthusiastic
Charles, he bowed to them in a manner
which testified the pleasure he experienced at again
beholding those whose acquaintance he had formed in
the ducal capital of Castelcicala.</p>

<p>“He is certainly a very fine young man,” said Sir
John Lascelles. “I have seldom seen a countenance
so expressive of vast mental resources:” then, after a
short pause, the worthy physician added, “I would
give much for a cast of his head.”</p>

<p>The Earl was about to make some reply, when his
own name was suddenly shouted forth by a voice in
the street: and that name, taken up by tongue after
tongue, was echoed by thousands of individuals who
were delighted to associate the stanch friend of the
industrious classes of England with their enthusiastic
welcomings of the royal champion of constitutional
freedom in Italy.</p>

<p>“Long live the Marshal-Prince of Montoni! three
cheers for the Earl of Ellingham!” were now the
cries that made the very welkin ring; and these shouts
were prolonged for some time, until the carriage of his
Royal Highness turned into the court-yard of St.
James’s palace, and the Earl on his side withdrew
from the balcony.</p>

<p>“You sigh, Charles?” said Lady Frances Ellingham,
in a low and somewhat anxious tone, and speaking
apart to him whom she believed to be Lady Hatfield’s
<em>nephew</em>.</p>

<p>“I was only thinking, dear Fanny,” answered the
young gentleman, “that much and earnestly as I may
strive to elevate myself, it will never be my good fortune
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
to have such opportunities as the Prince of Montoni
found for distinguishing his name and acquiring
on immense reputation.”</p>

<p>“Are you envious of him, Charles?” enquired the
beautiful maiden, in a somewhat reproachful tone. “I
thought that you recked not for titles and high
rank&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not when they are hereditary,” hastily replied
Charles Hatfield: “and this assurance I have
often given you in secret&mdash;because I should not like
to make such an observation before your noble father,
whose title <em>is</em> hereditary. But I admire&mdash;yes, and I
envy too, the honours which a great man acquires by
his own merits! Do you imagine that the English
people would have assembled in vast crowds to hail
and welcome one of their own royal Dukes? No, indeed!
And yet they seem as if they could not testify
their joy in too lively a manner, when the Prince of
Montoni appears amongst them.”</p>

<p>While this little dialogue was taking place in one
part of the spacious drawing-room at the Earl of
Ellingham’s mansion, the nobleman himself was conversing
with his wife and Lady Hatfield in another&mdash;the
entire group having withdrawn from the balcony,
and Sir John Lascelles having quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Earl, in answer to a question put
to him by Lady Hatfield; “I have understood that
the Prince proposes to stay some weeks in London.
The Princess Isabella has not accompanied him&mdash;her
royal parents, the Grand Duke Alberto and the Grand
Duchess, being loth to part with her. The Prince has
taken up his abode&mdash;at least, so states the morning
newspaper&mdash;at Markham Place, the house where he
was born and where all his youth and a portion of his
manhood were passed. Accordingly, as you desire,
Georgiana, I will call upon his Royal Highness to-morrow;
and I will request him to accept of an entertainment
at this mansion.”</p>

<p>“How did it occur,” enquired the Countess of Ellingham,
“that Thomas was not with us just now to behold
the progress of the Prince to St. James’s?”</p>

<p>“You know, dear Esther,” answered Lady Hatfield,
“that my husband loves privacy and seclusion, and
especially avoids appearing in crowded places. He
fears to be recognised,” she added, sinking her voice
so as to be inaudible to Charles and Lady Frances, who
were at the opposite end of the apartment: “and he
is perhaps right&mdash;although so many years have elapsed
since those occurrences&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To which we will not refer,” interrupted Lord
Ellingham, hastily. “How very seriously the young
people appear to be conversing together,” he added,
glancing towards Charles Hatfield and Lady Frances.</p>

<p>“Charles has imbibed certain romantic ideas and
hopes of distinguishing himself in the world,” observed
Georgiana; “and I think it right to encourage such
noble&mdash;such generous aspirations. But your charming
daughter is evidently remonstrating with him upon
some point: and yet the two cousins appear to be
much attached to each other,” she added, with rather
an anxious look at the Earl, as if she were uncertain
how he might receive the observation, into which she
threw a degree of significancy.</p>

<p>“You have mentioned a circumstance which gives
me much pleasure&mdash;nay, not only myself, but likewise
my dearest Esther,” said the nobleman. “We have
already adopted it as the basis of many happy plans
for the future&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” observed the Countess of Ellingham, emphatically:
“an alliance between Charles and our beloved
daughter, would prove a source of felicity and
satisfaction to us all.”</p>

<p>“Arthur&mdash;and you, too, dear Esther,” murmured
Lady Hatfield, in a tone indicative of deep emotions,
“I thank you for these assurances. All my earthly
ambition&mdash;my sole hope, would be accomplished on the
day that such an union took place. Alas! poor boy&mdash;it
is distressing&mdash;Oh! it is distressing to be compelled
to veil from him the real secret of his parentage&mdash;to
hear him at times question me relative to his parents&mdash;his
<em>supposed</em> parents, who are represented to be no
more! Yes&mdash;and it is cruel, too, to be forced to deceive
him&mdash;to hear him call me his <em>aunt</em>&mdash;I, who am
his <em>mother</em>!”</p>

<p>“Georgiana&mdash;dearest Georgiana, do not thus afflict
yourself!” murmured Esther, pressing Lady Hatfield’s
hand in a tender manner, and speaking in a tone of
consolation and sweet sympathy.</p>

<p>But almost at the same instant a piercing scream
burst from Georgiana’s lips; and she fell senseless into
the arms of the Countess of Ellingham&mdash;while the
Earl, turning mechanically and hastily round, beheld
Charles standing close behind him,&mdash;pale&mdash;astounded&mdash;petrified!
For the young man had advanced unperceived&mdash;and
his tread unheard on the thick, soft
carpet&mdash;towards the group formed by Lady Hatfield,
the nobleman, and the Countess: and his ears had
caught these words&mdash;“to hear him call me <em>aunt</em>&mdash;I,
who am his <em>mother</em>!”</p>

<p>For a few instants he stood motionless&mdash;amazed and
stupefied by what he had heard:&mdash;but, suddenly recovering
the power of movement and yielding to the
ineffable sensations which were excited in his breast,
he sprang forward&mdash;and catching his still insensible
parent in his arms, he cried, “Oh! my dearest mother&mdash;my
beloved, my adored mother&mdash;open your eyes&mdash;look
upon me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“His mother!” exclaimed Lady Frances, overwhelmed
with surprise, and unable, in the innocence
of her virgin heart, to form even the slightest notion
that might serve as a clue to what was still so deep a
mystery to her.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;my dearest Fanny,” said the Earl, hastily
drawing his daughter aside and speaking to her in a
low and rapid tone: “Charles is indeed the <em>son</em>&mdash;and
not the <em>nephew</em>&mdash;of Mr. Hatfield and Lady Georgiana.
But reasons of an imperious necessity&mdash;reasons which
you are too young to comprehend, and too discreet to
enquire into&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My dear father, I seek to know no more than it
may please you to tell me,” interrupted the young
lady, with a decision as amiable as it was dutiful and
re-assuring: “and my behaviour shall henceforth be
as if I had not been accidentally made the spectatress
of this scene.”</p>

<p>“You are my own beloved&mdash;darling daughter!”
exclaimed the Earl enthusiastically, as he pressed his
lips to the pure and chaste forehead of the charming
countenance that was upturned so lovingly towards
his own.</p>

<p>By this time Lady Hatfield had been recovered
through the kind attentions of Esther; and, awaking
to consciousness, she clasped her son to her bosom,
murmuring in a faint tone and broken voice, “Now
you have learnt my secret, Charles&mdash;a secret which&mdash;But
another time&mdash;another time, you shall know all!
Oh! Charles&mdash;I feel so much happiness and so much
sorrow&mdash;strangely blended&mdash;at this moment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Compose yourself, dearest&mdash;dearest parent!” exclaimed
the young man, his tears flowing freely. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
now know that you are my mother&mdash;and I care to
know nothing more! Never&mdash;never shall I question
you concerning the past: the enjoyment of the present,
and the hope which gilds the future&mdash;these are
enough for me!”</p>

<div id="i_041" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“My poor boy!” murmured Lady Hatfield, straining
him to her breast: “I feel as if an immense
weight were taken from my mind&mdash;I seem to drink of
a purer source of happiness than I have ever yet known&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
why did I ever hesitate to tell thee that thou
wast my son!”</p>

<p>And again she pressed him closer and closer still to
her bosom, covering his brow and cheeks with kisses;
while tears flowed from the eyes of the Countess and
of Lady Frances at the touching spectacle&mdash;and the
Earl turned aside to conceal his emotions.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXI">CHAPTER CXXI.<br />

<span class="medium">MR. HATFIELD.</span></h2>

<p>In the meantime Sir John Lascelles had repaired to
the library in the Earl of Ellingham’s mansion; and
there he found, as he had anticipated, his friend Mr.
Hatfield&mdash;<em>late</em> Tom Rain.</p>

<p>This individual was now in his fiftieth year; and he
was much changed by time as well as by art. He still
possessed the fine teeth which caused the beholder to
forget the somewhat coarse thickness of the lips;&mdash;but
the laugh that came from those lips, when he was
in a happy mood, was more subdued and quiet than
when the reader first made his acquaintance many
years previously to the present date. Though never
inclined to corpulency, he had nevertheless become
thinner: yet his form was still upright, muscular, and
well-knit. In his calm moments, especially when he
was alone, a slight shade of melancholy appeared upon
his countenance;&mdash;and he even sighed at times as he
thought upon the past</p>

<p>These were the changes which the lapse of years
had effected in regard to him; and the appliances of
art rendered it still more difficult to recognise in the
Mr. Hatfield of 1846 the rollicking Tom Rain of 1827.
For his hair and whiskers were dyed a very dark hue;
and his attire was a plain suit of black.</p>

<p>Was he happy? Yes&mdash;to a certain extent, in spite
of the shade of melancholy and the occasional sighs.
His was a disposition originally so gay and joyous,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
that it could not be completely subdued&mdash;only mellowed
down. Years of rigorous integrity&mdash;boundless
charity&mdash;never-failing philanthropy&mdash;and innumerable
good deeds, had established in his mind a confidence
that the errors of his early life were fully
expiated;&mdash;and so complacently could he look upon
the present, that he no longer reproached himself for
the past.</p>

<p>This was the usual tenour of his mind: but, as we
have already hinted, there were now and then moody
intervals in which thought became painful. These
were, however, of no frequent occurrence;&mdash;and, thus&mdash;on
the whole&mdash;we may assert that Mr. Hatfield <em>was</em>
happy.</p>

<p>The conduct of Lady Georgiana towards him, from
the moment of their union, had been of an affectionate
and touching nature. She studied to enact the part of
the tender wife&mdash;the sincere friend&mdash;and the amiable
woman: and she succeeded fully. Espousing him at
first solely on account of their child, she soon began to
like her husband&mdash;next to admire him&mdash;eventually to
love him. She found him to be possessed of numerous
good qualities&mdash;noble and generous feelings&mdash;and sentiments
far more refined than she could possibly have
anticipated. The terms on which he lived with her,
therefore, aided in insuring his happiness; and the
fine principles as well as handsome appearance of their
son, were a source of profound delight to them both.</p>

<p>Mr. de Medina had died possessed of great wealth&mdash;one
half of which was bequeathed to Mr. Hatfield.
This amount, joined to Lady Hatfield’s fortune, rendered
them very wealthy; and their riches were almost
doubled by the demise of Sir Ralph Walsingham,
Georgiana’s uncle, who left them all his fine estates.
Thus their income might be calculated at thirty thousand
a-year; and no inconsiderable portion of this
splendid revenue was devoted to humane and charitable
purposes.</p>

<p>When Sir John Lascelles entered the library, as
above stated, Mr. Hatfield hastened to welcome him
with all the affectionate assiduity of a son receiving a
visit from a kind and venerable parent; and the worthy
physician evidently experienced a greater elasticity
of feeling towards Mr. Hatfield than to any other friend
whom he possessed on earth. The one never could
forget that he owed his life to the science of the doctor:
the other looked on Hatfield as a person whom he had
actually restored to the world, and as a living proof of
the triumph which had crowned long years of research
in respect to a particular study.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” said Sir John Lascelles, when
they were both seated, “I have just witnessed a spectacle
that I must candidly admit to have been very
gratifying. The English are a most generous-hearted
people, and are quick also in the appreciation of sterling
merit. The Earl’s name was just now coupled with
the shouts of applause that welcomed the Prince of
Montoni.”</p>

<p>“I am rejoiced to hear these tidings,” observed Mr.
Hatfield. “Indeed, it struck me, as the sounds of the
myriad voices reached my ears in the seclusion of this
room, remote though it be from the apartment whence
you have just come,&mdash;it struck me, I say, that I heard
my brother’s name mentioned. For nineteen years has
Arthur now struggled in the interests of the middle
and industrious classes: session after session has he
passed in review the miseries and the wrongs endured
by the sons and daughters of toil;&mdash;and what has he
experienced from the several Administrations which
have succeeded each other during that period? Though
Whigs and Tories have held the reins of power in their
turns, the treatment received by my brother has been
uniformly the same. The most strenuous opposition
to all his grand proposals has been offered; and when
some trifling point has been conceded, ’twas as if a boon
were conferred instead of an act of justice done. But
although Arthur has thus failed in inducing the Government
to adopt large and comprehensive measures
for the relief, benefit, and elevation of the industrious
classes, he has at least succeeded in giving such an
impetus to Liberal sentiments out of doors&mdash;beyond
the walls of the Senate-house&mdash;that he has taught
millions to think, who never thought before, upon
their political condition. Though baffled in the Legislative
Assembly&mdash;though thwarted by the old school
of aristocracy, and the supporters of those vile abuses
which are summed up in the phrase ‘<em>the landed interest</em>’&mdash;though
opposed with unmitigated hostility
by the worshippers of ‘<em>the wisdom of our ancestors</em>,’&mdash;nevertheless,
Arthur has returned undaunted to the
charge. Never disheartened&mdash;never cast down&mdash;always
courageous in the People’s Cause, he has fearlessly
exposed the rottenness of our antiquated institutions,
and mercilessly torn away the veil from our
worn-out systems. The millions recognise and appreciate
his conscientious&mdash;his unwearied strivings in their
behalf; and they adore him as their champion. Unassuming&mdash;honest&mdash;and
free from all selfishness as he
is, it must nevertheless have been a proud moment
for my brother when he heard his name associated ere
now with that of the illustrious Prince who achieved
the liberation of Castelcicala beneath the walls of
Montoni.”</p>

<p>“The gratitude of the industrious classes is the most
welcome reward that a well-intentioned and a true patriot
can possibly experience,” observed Sir John Lascelles.
“The Earl certainly seemed pleased with the
high but merited compliment thus paid to him&mdash;although
not for one minute did he seek it, when he appeared
at the balcony; for I noticed that he rather
endeavoured to conceal himself behind the window-curtain.
But speaking of the Prince&mdash;he is a very
handsome young man.”</p>

<p>“The Castelcicalans absolutely worship him,” said
Mr. Hatfield; “and they look upon him as in every
way fitted to succeed the Grand Duke Alberto, whenever
death shall snatch away that great and enlightened
sovereign from the throne.”</p>

<p>“It was in the Castelcicalan capital that poor Jacob
Smith breathed his last&mdash;was it not?” enquired the
physician.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;in the suburbs of Montoni,” answered Mr.
Hatfield. “As you are well aware, the poor youth
never recovered the shock which he sustained on learning
that he owed his being to that dreadful man&mdash;Benjamin
Bones; and the horrible way in which that
remorseless wretch died, augmented the weight of the
fearful blow caused by that discovery. Jacob scarcely
ever rallied&mdash;scarcely ever held up his head afterwards:
the only gleam of happiness which he knew
was afforded by the good tidings that we received relative
to the Bunces&mdash;and even that was insufficient
to sustain his drooping spirit. He languished away&mdash;for
six years he pined in sorrow, accessible to no consolation
that travelling, change of scenery, or our attentions
could impart. It was several years before
the Great Revolution, which, conducted by Richard
Markham, gave freedom to Castelcicala and raised up
that hero to a princely rank,&mdash;it was some years before
this glorious era, that Jacob Smith&mdash;for he always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
retained that name&mdash;breathed his last. We buried
him in a picturesque cemetery on the banks of the
river Ferretti; and a cross&mdash;according to the custom
of that Catholic country&mdash;was placed to mark his
last home.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” exclaimed the doctor. “He was
always sickly&mdash;and the discovery of his hideous
parentage was too much for so weak a constitution.
And now let us turn to another subject:&mdash;have you
received the letters which you expected concerning
the various individuals&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know to whom you allude,” interrupted Mr.
Hatfield; “and I have now before me,” he added,
glancing at several letters, “the correspondence relating
to those persons. Timothy Splint still remains
the occupant of a fine farm in the backwoods of the
United States; and the last nineteen years of his
existence have proved the sincere penitence which he
feels for the crimes of his earlier days. He possesses
a competency&mdash;if not positive wealth. By his marriage
with the daughter of a neighbouring settler, he
has a numerous family; and he brings up his children
in the ways of morality and virtue. Indeed, I am
well aware <em>that he has lived to bless the period when
he went through the ordeal of the subterranean
dungeon</em>.”</p>

<p>“You prophesied that he would!” exclaimed Sir
John Lascelles. “Yes&mdash;those were the very words
which you used when speaking of him to me nineteen
years ago. I recollect them perfectly;&mdash;for age has
not impaired my memory, thank heaven!”</p>

<p>“I now come to Joshua Pedler,” resumed Mr. Hatfield,
“You will remember, my dear doctor, that this
man and his wife Matilda were appointed to the
charge of the Eddystone Light-house. There they
remained for six or seven years&mdash;as indeed I wrote to
you to this effect a long time ago&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and then you sent them out as emigrants to
Canada,” interrupted Sir John Lascelles; “and they
continued to do well. What say your last accounts
concerning them?”</p>

<p>“They are still happy&mdash;contented&mdash;and prosperous,”
answered Mr. Hatfield. “Their shop at Quebec thrives
admirably; and they have managed to put by several
hundred pounds. Pedler says that the sweetest bread
he has ever eaten in his life, has been that which he
has earned by his honest toils. I have reason to feel
convinced, moreover, that he is kind and good towards
his wife, and that his only regret is their not having
any children.”</p>

<p>“And the Bunces are still living in St. Peter’s-Port,
after having acquired a competency in the Island of
Sark?” enquired the physician.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;they are still in the capital of Guernsey,”
was the response. “Bunce tells me in his letter that
his wife’s health does not improve; in fact, she doubtless
received a cruel shock when she heard of the
death of Jacob Smith&mdash;for it had been her hope that
he might some day take up his abode with her and
her husband&mdash;a hope which she however nourished in
secret.”</p>

<p>“Bunce himself has never learnt the real parentage
of Jacob, I believe?” said the physician. “Indeed, I
remember you told me the other day that his wife,
always bearing in mind the injunctions you conveyed
to her through Mrs. Harding, had retained as a profound
secret her former illicit connexion with Benjamin
Bones.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it was useless to make a revelation which
would only have troubled their domestic peace,” said
Mr. Hatfield. “Harding divined the hope that the
woman had formed relative to Jacob&mdash;and in his
letters he communicated his ideas to me. But even if
death had spared Jacob, he would not have quitted me&mdash;no,
not though it were to dwell with his own
mother!”</p>

<p>“And Jeffreys?” asked the physician: “what of
him?”</p>

<p>“He is well pleased that he removed last summer
from Hackney to Liverpool. The money he had saved
during a period of eighteen years at his shop in the
London suburb, enabled him to take a very handsome
establishment in the great commercial town in the
north; and he is carrying on a large and flourishing
business.”</p>

<p>“Thus, in every instance, save that of Old Death,
have you succeeded in reclaiming those wicked people
whose reform you took in hand,” said Sir John Lascelles.
“Tidmarsh died tranquilly in his bed in the
Island of Alderney&mdash;and the others still exist, worthy
members of society.”</p>

<p>With these words the physician rose and took his
leave; and almost immediately after he had quitted
the library, the Earl of Ellingham entered, closing
the door behind him with the caution of one who
has some important or mysterious communication to
make.</p>

<p>“Arthur, you have evil tidings for me?” exclaimed
Mr. Hatfield, advancing towards his noble half-brother.</p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;they can scarcely be called evil, Thomas,”
was the reply: “and yet&mdash;’twould perhaps have been
better&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Speak! Keep me not in suspense,” interrupted
the other.</p>

<p>“Charles&mdash;your son&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! he has discovered his parentage!” cried Hatfield.
“Yes&mdash;I am sure that this is the circumstance
which you came to communicate;”&mdash;and he walked
twice up and down the room in an agitated manner:
then, suddenly turning towards his brother, he said,
“How did this occur, Arthur?”</p>

<p>The Earl related the incident just as it had taken
place, not forgetting the short but impressive dialogue
which he had with his own daughter, Lady Frances,
respecting the sudden and accidental revelation of the
secret of Charles Hatfield’s birth.</p>

<p>“After all, I am not sorry that this has so happened,”
observed the nobleman’s half-brother. “Sooner
or later the truth must have been confided to my son&mdash;my
dear son;&mdash;and since the secret may still be preserved
in respect to the world and to those whom we
would not wish to become acquainted with it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sir John Lascelles himself does not even suspect
it,” interrupted Arthur. “It is known but to our immediate
family&mdash;and Georgiana’s honour is as safe as
ever it was. The breath of scandal cannot reach it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my dear brother&mdash;a thousand thanks for
this assurance!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield. “And now
let my son come hither to embrace me as his father:&mdash;but,
Arthur,” he added, sinking his voice to a low
and solemn tune, “let him not enquire into the motives
which induced his parents to envelop his birth in mystery.
Enjoin him to forbear from any attempt to
gratify his curiosity in that respect!”</p>

<p>“I hope&mdash;indeed, I believe that you have no painful
ordeal of such a nature to apprehend,” replied the Earl
of Ellingham; and having thus spoken, he quitted the
library.</p>

<p>Two minutes elapsed, during which Mr. Hatfield
once more paced the apartment in an agitated manner:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
for, knowing the fine spirit of his son, he trembled lest
it should be checked or even broken by the mortifying
suspicion that he was illegitimate!</p>

<p>“A falsehood is abhorrent to me,” he thought within
himself: “and yet&mdash;if he should question me respecting
his birth&mdash;I dare not avow the truth! I must not
confess to my own son that his being resulted from an
atrocious outrage perpetrated by myself:&mdash;nor must I
permit him to suspect the honour of his mother!
Silence on my part, I now perceive, would engender
such suspicion in respect to her; and she must not
lose one particle of the dignity of virtue in the eyes of
her own offspring! Alas! painful position!&mdash;and,
Oh! with what foolish and short-sighted haste did I
ere now affirm that I was not sorry for the discovery
which he had made!”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and Charles sprang
forward into his father’s arms, which were extended to
receive him.</p>

<p>For some minutes they remained silent&mdash;each too
profoundly the prey to ineffable emotions to give utterance
to a syllable.</p>

<p>“I am proud&mdash;I am rejoiced to be able to call you
by the sacred name of <em>Father</em>!” at length exclaimed
Charles, speaking with the abrupt loosening of the
tongue which was caused by a sudden impulse. “But
are you&mdash;are you well pleased that accident should
have thus revealed to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Charles&mdash;my dear boy,” interrupted Mr. Hatfield,
summoning all his firmness to his aid, “you must be
aware that weighty reasons&mdash;the weightiest reasons&mdash;could
alone have induced your mother and myself to
practise a deception towards you and the world in
respect to the degree of relationship in which you
really stood with regard to us. Is it sufficient for you
to know at last that you <em>are</em> our son?&mdash;or do you demand
of me an explanation wherefore you must still
pass as our <em>nephew</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh! then Lord Ellingham spoke truly as he
brought me hither just now!” cried Charles, in a tone
of vexation: then, in another moment brightening up,
he added feelingly, “But by what right do I dare to
question the conduct of parents who have ever treated
me so kindly? No&mdash;my dear father&mdash;I seek not any
explanation at your hands&mdash;I am content to obey your
wishes in all things.”</p>

<p>“Generous youth!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield.
“Though you must pass as my nephew, Charles, yet
in all respects shall you continue to be treated as my
son! You are doubtless aware that I am rich&mdash;very
rich;&mdash;and all that your mother and myself possess is
bequeathed to you.”</p>

<p>“One word, father&mdash;only one word!” cried Charles.
“I have an ardent longing to ask a single question&mdash;and
yet I dare not&mdash;no&mdash;I cannot tutor my lips to
frame the words&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Speak!” said, Mr. Hatfield, emphatically: “I can
almost divine the question you hesitate to put to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear father&mdash;I would rather know the
truth at once than remain in suspense, a prey to a
thousand wild conjectures&mdash;the truth regarding one
point&mdash;and only one!” repeated the young man, in an
earnest and imploring tone. “And imagine not,” he
continued, speaking with increased warmth and
rapidity, “that I should ever look less lovingly or less
respectfully upon my dear mother&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Set that suspicion at rest, my son,” interrupted
Mr. Hatfield, in a solemn manner. “Your mother has
ever been an angel of innocence and purity! As God
is my judge she has never been guilty of weakness
or frailty&mdash;no&mdash;never&mdash;never!” he added emphatically.</p>

<p>“And therefore no stigma is upon my birth?” asked
Charles, his heart palpitating&mdash;or rather fluttering
violently, as he awaited the response.</p>

<p>“None!” replied his father, with an effort which
was, however, unnoticed by the young man in the
excitement of his own feelings.</p>

<p>“God be thanked!” exclaimed he, wringing Mr.
Hatfield’s hand in gratitude for this assurance. “And
now I seek to learn no more.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXII">CHAPTER CXXII.<br />

<span class="medium">TWO OF THE READER’S OLD FRIENDS.</span></h2>

<p>Bucklersbury&mdash;a tortuous street, leading from
Cheapside to Walbrook&mdash;abounds in dining-rooms,
where for fifteen pence the “City man” can procure
a meal somewhat on the “cheap and nasty” principle.
There’s ten-pence for a plate of meat, cut off a joint&mdash;two-pence,
a pint of porter&mdash;a penny, potatoes&mdash;a
penny, bread&mdash;and a penny the waiter.</p>

<p>The moment a person enters one of these establishments
and seats himself at a table, a waiter with a
dirty apron to his waist, and a ditto napkin over his
arm, rushes up, and gabbles through the bill-of-fare,
just in the same rapid and unintelligible manner as an
oath is administered to a juryman or a witness in a
court of justice.</p>

<p>It was while the preceding scenes were taking place
at the West End of London, that two gentlemen
lounged into a dining-room in Bucklersbury, and took
their places, facing each other, at one of the numerous
little tables that were spread with dirty cloths and
strewn in a random fashion with knives, forks, salt-sellars,
pepper-boxes, and vinegar-cruets,&mdash;all in preparation
for the afternoon’s process of “feeding.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the two gentlemen thus brought themselves
to an anchor, when the waiter darted up to
them as if the necessity of speed were a matter of life
or death;&mdash;and, heedless whether the visitors were
attending to him or not, the domestic functionary
hurried over the list of delicacies at that moment in
readiness in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Roast beef&mdash;biled beef&mdash;roast leg of pork&mdash;biled leg
of pork and pease pudding&mdash;fillet of veal and ’am&mdash;beef
steak pie&mdash;biled leg of mutton and caper sarse&mdash;greens&mdash;colliflowers&mdash;and
taturs. Give your orders,
gentle-<em>men</em>.”</p>

<p>But were the rapidity of the waiter’s utterance properly
represented in print, his repetition of the bill-of-fare
would more properly stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Roast beef biled beef roast leg of pork biled leg of
pork and pease pudding fillet of veal and ’am beefsteak
pie biled leg of mutton and caper sarse greens colliflowers
and taturs give your orders gentle-<em>men</em>!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what shall we have, old fellow?” said the
younger gentleman of the two to his companion.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! ’an it’s afther boiled leg of por-r-rk and
paze pudding that I am, my frind!” was the emphatic
reply, delivered with a ferocious look at the waiter as
much as to let that individual know that he had better
not have any of his nonsense&mdash;although nothing was
farther from the poor devil’s thoughts at the moment.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir!” cried the waiter. “Biled pork
and pease pudding!” he shouted out for the behoof of
the young lady within the bar at the remote end of the
room.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>“And the same for me,” said the Irishman’s companion.</p>

<p>“Same for gentle-<em>man</em>!” bawled the waiter, again
addressing himself to the young lady just alluded to.
“Ale or stout, gentle-<em>men</em>?”</p>

<p>“Porther&mdash;a pint!” exclaimed the ferocious Hibernian.</p>

<p>“Pale ale for me,” intimated his friend.</p>

<p>“Pint of porter and pint palale for gentle-<em>men</em>!”
vociferated the waiter. “Weggitubles&mdash;bread?” he
next demanded.</p>

<p>“No bread&mdash;greens!” ejaculated the Irishman.</p>

<p>“Bread and potatoes for me,” said his companion.</p>

<p>“One bread&mdash;one greens&mdash;one taturs&mdash;for gentle-<em>men</em>!”
cried the waiter, thus conveying his last instructions
to the young lady who officiated at the bar;
and the said young lady sent each fresh order down a
pipe communicating with the kitchen&mdash;her own voice
being as affected and her manner as lackadaisical
as the waiter was natural, rapid, and bustling.</p>

<p>But before the various luxuries thus commanded
were hoisted from the kitchen to the bar by means of
the moveable dumb-waiter that worked up and down
between the two places just mentioned,&mdash;we must
pause to inform our readers&mdash;if indeed they have not
already suspected the fact&mdash;that the two visitors to
the dining-establishment in Bucklersbury, were our
old friends Captain O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Francis
Curtis!</p>

<p>The gallant Irishman had now numbered sixty-four
years; and although the lapse of time had rendered
his head completely bald, and turned his whiskers and
moustachios to a bright silver, the ferocity of his aspect
remained unaltered, and his fiery disposition was unsubdued.
He was still the terrible Captain O’Blunderbuss&mdash;ready
to exchange shots with any one and on
all occasions&mdash;and more devoted to poteen than ever.
His form was as erect as when in the prime of life;
and his military coat, all frogged and braided, was
buttoned over an ample chest that no stoop had contracted.
The captain had grown somewhat stouter
than when we took leave of him nineteen years previously
to our present date; but his physical strength
seemed to have remained unimpaired.</p>

<p>Frank Curtis was now forty-three. He also had
“filled out,” as the phrase is; but his countenance, in
fattening, had lost nothing of its ignoble expression
of self-sufficiency and impudent conceit; and his manner
was as flippant as ever. Neither had he laid aside
any portion of his mendacious habits, but had rather
added thereto by varying the style of his boastings
and the nature of his lies. He continued to dress in a
flashy way&mdash;delighting in a hat of strange appearance,
and in a waistcoat concentrating in a yard of
stuff all the colours which have existence and name
upon earth.</p>

<p>We must however admit&mdash;for the truth cannot be
blinked in this respect&mdash;that there was a certain air of
seediness about both the captain and Mr. Frank
Curtis, which neither the bullying insolence of the
former nor the impertinent self-sufficiency of the latter
could altogether throw into the shade. It was evident
that they had lost the confidence of their tailors and
hatters&mdash;and even of their washerwomen;&mdash;for their
garments might have been less thread-bare, and their
wristbands a trifle cleaner. We say “wristbands,”
because those were the only portions of their shirts
which met the eye&mdash;the captain’s frogged coat and
Mr. Curtis’s faded double-breasted waistcoat being
each buttoned up to its owner’s throat.</p>

<p>“Waiter-r!” vociferated the gallant officer, when
about a minute and a half had elapsed from the time
that the orders had been given for the repast.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;coming, sir,” cried the functionary thus
addressed, as he hurried away in quite another direction.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus!” ejaculated the captain, thumping his
fist so vigorously down upon the table that the pepper
box danced the polka with the mustard-pot, and the
knives and forks performed a <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">pas de quatre</em>. “Is that
boiled por-r-rk and paze pudding afther coming to-day
at all, at all?”</p>

<p>“Just coming, sir!” said the waiter, under no excitement
whatever, though in an immense bustle&mdash;for
waiters always remain cool and imperturbable when
most in a hurry.</p>

<p>“If it don’t come in sivin seconds, ye villain,” thundered
the captain, “I’ll skin ye alive!”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said the waiter, as he hastened to
attend upon some new-comers.</p>

<p>“The beauty of the French eating-houses is that
the moment you order things they appear on the table
by magic,” observed Frank Curtis, in a tone loud
enough to let every one present know that he had
been in France. “When I was in Paris&mdash;on that
secret mission from the English Government, you
know, captain&mdash;&mdash;-”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and I remimber quite well,” exclaimed
the gallant officer. “’Twas at the same time that I
wint to offer my swor-r-d and services to the Imperor
of the Tur-r-rks&mdash;the Sulthan, I mane.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Frank. “Well&mdash;as I was going to
tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Two biled pork&mdash;two pease pudding&mdash;for gentle-<em>men</em>,”
cried the waiter at this juncture, as he set the
plates upon the table. “One&mdash;bread&mdash;one greens&mdash;one
taturs&mdash;for gentle-<em>men</em>.”</p>

<p>The captain and Mr. Curtis fell to work upon the
delicacies thus placed before them; and after an interval
of silence, during which the boiled pork and <em>et
ceteras</em> disappeared with astonishing rapidity, the latter
leaning across the table, said in a low whisper, “It was
a deuced lucky thing that I met my friend Styles just
now; for if he hadn’t lent me this sovereign, we might
have gone without dinner as well as without breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and that’s thrue enough, Frank!” returned
the gallant officer, likewise in <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sotto voce</em>. “Where
did ye appint to mate Misther Styles again this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“At a nice quiet little public that I know of&mdash;where
there’s a good parlour and capital spirits,” answered
Mr. Curtis.</p>

<p>“Ah! the thrue potheen&mdash;the rale cratur!” said the
captain. “Well that’s a blissing, at all evints! And,
be Jasus! I hope your frind Misther Styles will be
after putting us up to do a something, as he suggisted&mdash;for,
be the power-r-rs! Frank, it’s hard work looking
about for the sinews of war-r-r!”</p>

<p>“Styles is a splendid fellow, captain,” replied Mr.
Curtis, smacking his lips after his last glass of pale ale&mdash;or
“palale,” as the waiter denominated it. “Why,
God bless you! It was him who got up the London and
Paris Balloon Conveyance Company, with Parachute
Branches to Dover and Calais.”</p>

<p>“And how came it to fail?” demanded the gallant
officer.</p>

<p>“Simply because it was never meant to succeed,”
answered Frank, in a matter-of-fact way. “The object
was to make money by showing the balloons and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
parachutes that were to be used in the business; and
the press took up the affair quite seriously. As long
as curiosity was kept alive, Styles cleared upwards of
five guineas a-day by the admissions at a shilling a
head. Ah! he’s a clever fellow&mdash;a deuced clever fellow,
I can tell you. But it’s pretty near time we went
to meet him: for, though he hasn’t any thing particular
to do at present, he always pretends to be in a
hurry, and never waits one minute over the hour for
an appointment:&mdash;that’s the way he has got himself
the character of a man of punctuality and business-habits.”</p>

<p>“Waiter-r!” vociferated Captain O’Blunderbuss.</p>

<p>“Coming, sir!” cried the functionary thus adjured:
then, rushing up to the table, he said interrogatively,
“Cheese, gentle-<em>men</em>?”</p>

<p>“No. What’s to pay?” demanded Curtis.</p>

<p>The waiter enumerated the items in a rapid manner
and mentioned the amount, which was forthwith discharged
by Frank, who ostentatiously threw down a
sovereign as if he had plenty more of the same kind
of coin in his pocket. On receiving his change, he
gave the waiter sixpence&mdash;a specimen of liberality
which induced that discriminating personage to disregard
all the other demands made at the moment
upon his services, until he had duly escorted the two
gentlemen to the door.</p>

<p>Upon quitting the dining-rooms, Captain O’Blunderbuss
and Mr. Frank Curtis proceeded arm-in-arm into
Cheapside; and, on catching a glimpse of the clock
of Bow Church, the latter gentleman said, “We are
in lots of time. It’s only half-past two&mdash;and we’re to
meet Styles at three at a public in Fleet Street. So
we needn’t gallop along as if a troop of sheriffs’ officers
were at our heels.”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! d’ye remember what fine fun we had
with the snaking scoundrels up in Baker Street?”
cried the gallant officer. “Why&mdash;it must be upwards
of twenty years ago&mdash;or nineteen at the laste!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and do you remember what larks we had in
the Bench too, during the time that the sleepy old
Commissioners remanded me for?” said Curtis.</p>

<p>“Be the holy poker-r! and I’ve forgotten nothing
of all that same!” ejaculated the captain. “But it
was a sad blow to ye, my frind, when Sir Christopher-r
died without laving ye a single sixpence!”</p>

<p>“I can’t bear to think of it, captain&mdash;although a
dozen years or more have passed since then. But who
do you think I saw the other day, riding in her carriage
just as if she had been a lady all her life?”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and ye mane Sir Christopher’s wife
that was!” exclaimed the gallant officer. “Had she
got the fine stout livery-servant standing up behind
as usual?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and young Blunt was inside,” added Curtis.
“He’s as like the stout footman as ever a lad was to a
middle-aged man in this world&mdash;the same pudding
face&mdash;sandy hair&mdash;stupid-looking eyes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now be the power-rs! I think you’re too hard
upon the footman, Frank!” interrupted the captain.
“He’s not such an ugly fellow as you would be afther
making him out. I don’t say, for insthance, that
he’s so handsome as you, my dear frind&mdash;or yet so
well made as me, Frank&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Very far from it, captain,” cried Mr. Curtis. “I
don’t think that we’re the worst looking chaps in
Cheapside at this moment. That’s exactly what
Styles said to us this morning. ‘<em>I want a couple of
genteel fellows like you</em>,’ says he, ‘<em>to join me in something
that I have in hand.</em>’”</p>

<p>“We’re the very boys to co-operate with him,
Frank!” exclaimed the captain: “and what’s more,
you and me can play into ache-other’s hands. ’Tisn’t
for nothing that we’ve been frinds for the last twinty
years.”</p>

<p>“In which time we’ve seen many ups and downs,
captain,” observed Frank,&mdash;“had many a good dinner,
and gone many a time without one&mdash;spent many a
guinea, and seen many a day when we didn’t know
where the devil to get a shilling&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be the power-rs! and had many a rar-r lar-r-rk
into the bargin!” said Captain O’Blunderbuss. “D’ye
renumber our gitting into the station-house the night
afther your dear wife left ye to jine the old gintleman
that fell in love with her, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And who was kind enough to take her off my
hands, children and all!” exclaimed Frank, laughing
heartily. “Ah! that was a glorious business&mdash;that
was&mdash;I mean, old Shipley relieving me of my dear
spouse and the five responsibilities.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t I conduct the bargin for ye?” demanded
the captain. “Didn’t I make him pony down
a thousand pounds to prevint an action of <em>crim. con.</em>?
Be the potheen of ould Ireland&mdash;I did that same business
as nate and clane as iver such a thing was setthled
in this wor-r-rld!”</p>

<p>“True enough, captain,” said Frank. “But it’s
just on the stroke of three, I declare!” he exclaimed,
glancing up at Saint Bride’s, which they were now
passing. “How we must have dawdled along! I
wish you wouldn’t loiter to stare at the gals so, captain,”
he added, laughing.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and it’s yourself, Frank, that ogles all
the lasses that we mate,” cried the captain, throwing
back an insinuation that was intended as a friendly
compliment. “But which is the place, me boy?”</p>

<p>“Here,” said Curtis, turning into a public-house in
Fleet Street just as the clock struck three.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXIII">CHAPTER CXXIII.<br />

<span class="medium">A MAN OF BUSINESS.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Bubbleton Styles was a gentleman of about
fifty years of age. Short, thin, dapper, and active,&mdash;with
a high, bald forehead, and small restless, twinging
eyes,&mdash;he seemed a perfect man of business&mdash;an
impression that was enhanced by a certain sly knowingness
which he had assumed years before, and which
was now habitual to him. He was uneducated and
ignorant: but he had studied the manner in which
well-instructed persons spoke&mdash;he compared their language
with his own&mdash;and he had actually weeded his
style of speech of the solecisms and grammatical
errors that originally characterised it. He had not,
however, been able to improve himself in spelling,
with equal facility; and therefore he took care never
to write a letter. He always had some plausible excuse
for throwing this duty in business matters upon
some other person more competent than himself.</p>

<p>Astute and cunning, he forebore from touching on
topics which he did not understand: but if the conversation
did turn, in spite of his endeavours to the
contrary, on subjects whereof he was ignorant, he so
artfully managed his observations that even those
who knew him well were far from suspecting that he
was otherwise than profoundly acquainted with the
matter under discussion. Every body thought him a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
very shrewd fellow;&mdash;and he had a habit of looking
so knowing and critical when any one was speaking,
that his opinion, when subsequently delivered, was
received with respect and deemed an authority.</p>

<p>The reader may therefore perceive that Mr. Bubbleton
Styles was a thorough man of the world. He took
care never to commit himself. In small money transactions
he was always regular and correct: he therefore
escaped the imputation of meanness, and actually
acquired at a cheap rate the denomination of “an
honourable character.” The consequence was, that
when he failed&mdash;which was very often indeed&mdash;in large
transactions, he was considered merely as “a spirited
but unsuccessful speculator,”&mdash;never as a dishonest
person.</p>

<p>He had an office in the City: but were any of his
friends to ask, “What <em>is</em> Styles?” the answer would be
a vague generality&mdash;such as, “Oh! he is a City man,
you know&mdash;engaged in business and all that!”&mdash;a
reply leaving the enquirer just as wise as he was
before. And yet, at his office, there were all the
symptoms and evidence of “business,”&mdash;a letter-box
at the door&mdash;a clerk engaged in writing at the desk&mdash;a
pile of letters here, and a heap of account-books
there&mdash;samples of many kinds of goods on the mantel
and shelves&mdash;mysterious-looking bales and hampers
on the floor&mdash;files covered with dingy papers, looking
like invoices and bills of lading&mdash;and the words <em>Bills
for Acceptance</em> labelled over a slit in the board-work
that enclosed the desk. Thus the place had a very
business-like aspect: and yet no one could define
what was the precise nature of the business carried on
there.</p>

<p>But we have travelled to Mr. Bubbleton Styles’s
office in Crosby Hall Chambers; whereas Mr. Bubbleton
Styles himself is just now in a tavern-parlour in
Fleet Street.</p>

<p>The clock had just <em>begun</em> to strike three as Captain
O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Frank Curtis entered the
public-house: and by the time they reached the aforesaid
parlour it was six seconds <em>past</em> three.</p>

<p>There sate Mr. Bubbleton Styles&mdash;with his silver
watch in his hand, and gazing at the Dutch clock over
the mantel-piece, as if he were anxiously comparing
the two dials, and found himself much put out because
there happened to be a slight difference between them.</p>

<p>“If I thought it was my watch that was wrong,”
he said aloud, apparently in a musing manner, but
really because he caught a glimpse of the entrance of
Curtis and Blunderbuss at the moment, and he never
lost an opportunity of impressing even his best friends
with an idea of his punctuality,&mdash;“if I thought it was
my watch that was wrong, I would trample it to
pieces beneath my heel.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;don’t do that, old fellow!” exclaimed Frank,
advancing towards him. “Much better give it to
me!”</p>

<p>“I would not do any thing so prejudicial to a friend
as present him with a watch that went irregularly,”
returned Mr. Styles, in a solemn tone. “But the fault
is <em>not</em> with my watch, I am convinced: it lies with
that rascally old clock. However, you are only six
seconds after your time: I should have allowed you the
full minute&mdash;and then I should have waited no longer.
Come, sit down, Curtis&mdash;Captain O’Blunderbuss, sit
down; I have just one hour to devote to you. As the
clock strikes four, I must be off. What will you take?”</p>

<p>“Potheen for me, if ye plaze,” said the gallant
officer.</p>

<p>“Brandy for me,” observed Frank.</p>

<p>“And wine-and-water for me,” added Mr. Bubbleton
Styles. “I never take spirits until after supper.”</p>

<p>The various beverages required, were immediately
ordered and supplied; and the three gentlemen proceeded
to business, the parlour at the tavern&mdash;or
rather public-house&mdash;being occupied only by themselves
at the moment.</p>

<p>“Well, old fellow,” said Mr. Frank Curtis, addressing
himself to Mr. Styles, “what good thing can you
put us up to?”</p>

<p>“A speculation that will enrich us all three,” replied
the gentleman thus appealed to. “I do not mind
telling you that I have been rather unfortunate lately
in one or two enterprises&mdash;and I want something to
set me square again. I have a few bills coming due
in a couple or three months, and would not have them
dishonoured on any account. Thank God! however,
I have no paltry debts&mdash;no mean milk-scores&mdash;no peddling
affairs. I always avoid them. Still I must
make a bold stroke for the sake of my larger transactions;&mdash;and
I presume that neither of you are averse
to earning a little money easily and speedily.”</p>

<p>“Arrah! and be Jasus! that’s the most wilcome
thing ye could be afther saying to me, my frind!” exclaimed
the captain, surveying the speculator with
deep admiration.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Mr. Styles, “I have been thinking
that we three can work the oracle well together&mdash;and
I propose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Mr. Curtis, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Hould your tongue&mdash;and have patience, Frank!”
ejaculated the gallant officer. “It shall be your turn
to spake prisintly. Well, sir&mdash;and what is it, thin,
that ye’re afther proposing!”</p>

<p>“A Railway!” returned Mr. Bubbleton Styles.</p>

<p>“Divil a betther idea could ye have formed!” cried
the captain, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Glorious!” exclaimed Curtis, in an equally impassioned
tone of approval.</p>

<p>“Don’t be excited&mdash;take things calmly&mdash;in a business-like
way,” said Mr. Bubbleton Styles. “It is
now twenty minutes past three: we have forty minutes
more to converse upon the subject. Much may be
done in that time. Here,” continued the speculator,
drawing a skeleton-map of England from his pocket,
and spreading it on the table; “you see this line
drawn almost longitudinally from one end of Great
Britain to the other? Well&mdash;that is my projected
Railway. You perceive, we start from Beachy Head
in Sussex&mdash;right on, as straight as we can go, to Cape
Wrath on the northern coast of Scotland. Of course
we avoid as much as possible placing any portion of
our line in competition with railways already existing;
but we shall have Branches to all the principal
cities and manufacturing towns, and Single Lines
wherever they may be asked for.”</p>

<p>“Capital, be Jasus!” exclaimed the Hibernian
officer, unable to restrain the exuberance of his delight
at this magnificent scheme. “And be what title
d’ye mane to call this purty little bantling of yours,
Misther Styles?”</p>

<p>“The Grand British Longitudinal Railway,” answered
the speculator, in a measured and emphatic
manner.</p>

<p>The captain was so elated by the grandeur and vast
comprehensiveness of this denomination, that he rang
the bell with furious excitement, and ordered the waiter
to replenish the glasses.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Mr. Bubbleton Styles, “having
expounded my views, it is necessary to take into consideration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
the mode of procedure. Of course I am
the promoter of the scheme; and to-morrow I shall
register it. This will only cost five pounds&mdash;and then
the thing is secured to us. ‘<em>Provisionally Registered,
pursuant to 7 and 8 Victoria, cap. 110</em>;’&mdash;and so
forth. Capital &pound;8,000,000, in 400,000 shares of &pound;20
each. Deposit, &pound;2 2s. per share. You, Frank, must
be the Secretary; and you, captain, Consulting Engineer.”</p>

<p>“Is it an Ingineer ye’d be afther making of me in
my ould age?” cried the gallant officer: “for, be the
power-rs! I’ve forgot more than I ever knew of that
same!”</p>

<p>“Oh! the place will be quite a sinecure&mdash;good pay
and nothing to do,” said Mr. Styles. “We shall have
a regular Engineer, as a matter of course; but it will
look business-like to speak in the prospectus of having
‘<em>secured the valuable services of that eminent Military
Engineer, Captain O’Blunderbuss, of Blunderbuss
Park, Ireland; who, having surveyed the whole of
the proposed line, in concert with the Company’s Civil
Engineer, has reported most favourably of the scheme,
and has offered suggestions which will produce a
saving to the Company of nearly half a million sterling
in the progress of the works</em>.’ This is the way to
manage business, gentlemen,” added Mr. Styles,
glancing in a satisfied manner at his two companions,
one after the other: then, looking at his watch, he
exclaimed, “Just ten minutes more to stay&mdash;and I
must be off! Now, we have settled that I am to be
Promoter&mdash;you, Curtis, are to be Secretary&mdash;and you,
captain, Consulting Engineer. This evening I will
draw up the prospectus: we must have about thirty
good names for the Provisional Committee&mdash;and by
to-morrow afternoon the document will be printed
and ready.”</p>

<p>“You will not have time to call on the people to
ask them to let you put down their names?” said
Frank Curtis, conceiving at the moment that his friend
was going a trifle too fast.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear fellow!” exclaimed Mr. Bubbleton
Styles: “I know that I can take the liberty of
using the names of at least half of my intended Provisional
Committee-men; and the others will not
think of contradicting the prospectus, when they see
that we have got Mr. Podgson as chairman.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;Podgson!” cried Mr. Curtis, almost wild
with joy and surprise. “You don’t mean to say that
you’ve got Podgson?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered the speculator, with his characteristic
coolness: “but I <em>shall</em> have him by this
time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I thought that you had not spoken of your scheme
to a soul before you met me and the captain this
morning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Neither had I&mdash;and Podgson is totally unaware at
this moment that such a project is in existence,” interrupted
Mr. Styles, calmly and deliberately. “But
I know how to deal with him: I have read his character
from a distance;&mdash;and, although I have never
yet exchanged a word with him in my life, depend
upon it I shall hook him as our chairman before I am
twenty-four hours older. Three minutes more!” cried
the speculator: then, as if to make the most of the
hundred and eighty seconds at his disposal, Mr. Styles
closed the present interview in the following business-like
and highly gratifying manner:&mdash;“You are both
as shabby as you well can be; and you must obtain
new clothes as soon as possible. Here is a ten-pound
note for each of you. Moreover you must get respectable
lodgings at once; and you can give a reference
to me. To-morrow, at three o’clock punctually,
there will be chops and sherry in readiness at my
office&mdash;and I shall expect you both. Not a moment
before three, remember&mdash;because you will be interrupting
me: and if you’re a moment after, I shall
decline any farther transactions with you. So good
bye&mdash;I haven’t time to shake hands.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Mr. Styles rushed from the room, it
being four o’clock to an instant;&mdash;and it is perhaps as
well to observe that this perfect man of business had
only made an appointment with his friends at the
public-house in Fleet Street, because he had another
gentleman to meet in the neighbourhood at six
minutes past four.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXIV">CHAPTER CXXIV.<br />

<span class="medium">CHARLES HATFIELD.</span></h2>

<p>It was past midnight; and in only one chamber
throughout the Earl of Ellingham’s spacious mansion
was a light still burning.</p>

<p>In that chamber Charles Hatfield was pacing to and
fro&mdash;his mind filled with thoughts of so bewildering,
exciting, and painful a nature, that he felt the inutility
of endeavouring to escape from them by retiring
to his couch.</p>

<p>This young man of twenty-five years of age,&mdash;so
handsome, so intelligent, and with the certainly of
inheriting vast riches,&mdash;possessing the most brilliant
worldly prospects, and knowing himself to be the
object of his parents’ devoted affection&mdash;entertaining,
too, a profound love for the beautiful Lady Frances
Ellingham, and having every reason to hope that his
passion was reciprocated,&mdash;this young man, with so
many advantages in respect to position, and so many
sources of felicity within his view,&mdash;Charles Hatfield
was restless and unhappy.</p>

<p>The striking incident which had marked the day&mdash;the
sudden discovery that those whom he had hitherto
looked upon as his uncle and his aunt, were in reality
his parents,&mdash;the assurance which he had received respecting
the honour of his mother and the legitimacy
of his birth,&mdash;then the mysterious fact that his parentage
was still to remain a secret to the world,&mdash;all
these circumstances combined to torment him with
doubts and misgivings&mdash;to excite his curiosity to a
painful degree&mdash;and to animate him with an ardent
longing to penetrate into all that was so obscure and
suspicious.</p>

<p>It was true that he had promised his mother never
to question her relative to a subject that might be disagreeable
to her;&mdash;for the moment, too, he had been
satisfied with the assurances of his legitimacy which
he had received from the lips of his father. But when
he found himself alone in his own bed-chamber&mdash;surrounded
by the stillness of night&mdash;he could no longer
check the natural current of his reflections:&mdash;the
deep silence in which the mansion was enveloped&mdash;the
secluded position of his apartment&mdash;and the slightly
romantic turn of his mind,&mdash;all united to give an impulse
to thoughts which were so intimately associated
with subjects of mysterious and strange import.</p>

<p>Then, many circumstances, remembered in connexion
with his early boyhood, but until now never before
pondered upon with serious attention,&mdash;recollections,
hitherto vague and disjointed,&mdash;gradually assumed a
more intelligible aspect to his mental contemplation:&mdash;memory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
exerted herself with all her energy, to fill
up blanks and bring vividly forward those reminiscences
that until this moment had been like dim and
misty vapours floating before the mind’s eye:&mdash;he
fixed his gaze intently on the past, until the feeblest
glimmerings assumed a bolder and more comprehensible
light;&mdash;and by degrees the confusion of his ideas
relative to his early being, yielded to something like
order&mdash;so that he became enabled to fit incidents into
their proper places, and even make some accurate calculations
with regard to the dates of particular occurrences.</p>

<div id="i_049" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In a word, a light had streamed in upon his soul&mdash;illuminating
many of the hitherto unexplored cells of
his memory,&mdash;giving significancy to recollections on
which he had never before paused to ponder, and investing
with importance various reminiscences that
had not until this period engaged his serious attention.</p>

<p>Naturally of a happy&mdash;cheerful disposition,&mdash;and
intent on soaring aspirations relative to the future,
rather than on speculations and wanderings connected
with the past,&mdash;he had never until now been struck
with certain facts which, though having a dwelling-place
in his memory, had failed to occupy his meditations
or excite any thing like suspicions in his mind.</p>

<p>But <em>the incident</em> of the day had set him to work, in
the silence of his chamber and the depth of night, to
call forth all those sleeping reminiscences&mdash;examine
them one by one&mdash;connect them together&mdash;make them
up as well as he could into a continuous history&mdash;and
from the aggregate deduce a variety of truths intimately
regarding himself.</p>

<p>All this was not done through any disrespect for
his mother or his father&mdash;any change of fueling in
reference to them. No:&mdash;he loved them the more
tenderly&mdash;the more fervently, now that he knew they
were <em>his parents</em>, and not <em>mere relations</em>. But if he
fell into the train of thought in which we now find
him engaged, it was that he could no more help
yielding to that current of reflections than a child
could avoid being carried whirlingly along the rapids
of the Canadian stream which had engulphed it.</p>

<p>And now let us see into what connected form the
meditations and recollections of Charles Hatfield had
settled themselves?</p>

<p>Seating himself at the table, on which he leant his
elbows, and supporting his head on his hands, in
which he buried his face, he pondered in the ensuing
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My earliest remembrances carry me back to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
period when I must have been about five years old;
and then I was accustomed to call a good woman
whose name was Watts, my <em>mother</em>. But she died&mdash;I
forget precisely under what circumstances; and then,
when I was nearly six, I was taken care of by a
gentleman named Rainford. Yes&mdash;and he had a
beautiful wife named Tamar;&mdash;and this Tamar was
the sister of the Countess of Ellingham. Mr. Rainford
and Tamar were very kind to me, I remember well;
but I was not with them long. And now there is so
much confusion in my thoughts&mdash;so much bewilderment
in my reminiscences touching that particular
period in my life, that I scarcely know how to render
my ideas continuously accurate. I fully recollect,
however, that he whom I grew accustomed to call by
the endearing name of ‘<em>father</em>’ although I knew that
he was not my father&mdash;I mean this Mr. Rainford,&mdash;I
recollect, I say, that he was absent for some weeks,
and that I pined after him. Then Tamar would reassure
me with promises of his return&mdash;but I remember
that she used to weep very much&mdash;oh! very much!
One day she put on black clothes&mdash;and she was going
to dress me in mourning also; but she cried bitterly,
and threw the dark garments away. Next I recollect
being taken to the house of Mr. de Medina, where I
saw Esther for the first time&mdash;that Esther who is now
Countess of Ellingham. The happiness I experienced
that day dwells in my mind; for I recollect as well as if
it were but yesterday, that all Tamar’s sorrow had suddenly
disappeared, and that she gave me the most earnest
promises that I should soon see Mr. Rainford again.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
And I did behold him again soon&mdash;but it was at some
town in France, whither I was taken by Mr. de Medina
and his two daughters.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Then we all travelled in a
post-chaise and four&mdash;and we repaired to Paris, where I
remember that the Earl of Ellingham and Jacob Smith
joined us.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Next we went to Havre-de-Grace&mdash;I remember
it was that town, because I have seen it since;
and there Mr. de Medina, Esther, and the Earl of
Ellingham left us&mdash;Mr. Rainford, Tamar, Jacob Smith,
and myself going on board of a ship.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> We were not
very long at sea, but the next incident which I remember
was travelling alone with Tamar to London,
where we took up our abode at the country-seat of Mr.
de Medina.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> That was at Finchley. We never went
out, I remember&mdash;but kept close to our own room,
Esther and Mr. de Medina frequently visiting us.
How long we lived in this manner I cannot recollect:
but now my mind settles with horror on the never-to-be-forgotten
lamentation which, child as I was, struck
horror to my soul as it echoed through the dwelling!
For Mr. de Medina and Esther had suddenly learnt
that Tamar&mdash;the good, kind Tamar&mdash;who had been
absent a considerable time that day, was foully and
brutally murdered. Oh! how I cried&mdash;how bitterly I
wept: but if I asked any questions&mdash;which I must
naturally suppose that I did&mdash;they were not answered,
or were answered vaguely. Yes&mdash;all particulars were
carefully kept from me;&mdash;and this was doubtless nothing
more than a mere matter of prudence&mdash;for I was
but a child of between six and seven! Mr. Rainford
now came back to live at Finchley; but how unhappy
he was! I remember well one evening&mdash;a very few
days only after the dreadful death of her whom I was
wont to call ‘<em>my mamma</em>’&mdash;that Mr. Rainford, after
a long conversation in whispers with Lord Ellingham,
suddenly turned towards me&mdash;caught me up in his
arms&mdash;and covered me with kisses. Yes&mdash;that incident
has ever remained indelibly impressed upon my
memory!<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> It was followed very soon by Tamar’s
funeral; and almost immediately afterwards I was
sent to a school at a great distance&mdash;for I remember
that Mr. de Medina and Esther themselves took me
there, and that we travelled all day in a post-chaise.
Ah! and now I recollect too&mdash;yes&mdash;it flashes to my
mind, that before they left me they charged me never
to mention the name of Rainford at the school;&mdash;for
my own name was at that time Charles Watts. For
three years did I remain there, Mr. de Medina and
Esther frequently visiting me, even after she had
become the Countess of Ellingham. Every six months
I went home to Finchley for the holidays, and found
Mr. Rainford always staying at Mr. de Medina’s house,
and always ready to receive me with kindness. Then
Mr. de Medina died; and we all went into mourning
for him. I returned to school for another year; and
when between ten and eleven I was suddenly sent for
home&mdash;that is, to the manor-house at Finchley, which
Mr. Rainford had continued to occupy after Mr. de
Medina’s death. But instead of meeting Mr. Rainford,
as I had expected, I was taken into the presence of a
gentleman and a lady, neither of whom I had ever
beheld before. These were Mr. Hatfield and Lady
Georgiana!”</p>

<p>Here the young man paused in his meditations, as
if to fix all his powers of thought with as much intensity
as possible upon that era of his life whence
dated at it were a new existence. But his ideas came
rushing in upon his soul with such overwhelming
force, as literally to hurry him along; and, obedient
to the current of continuous and self-linking reflections,
he thus proceeded in that silent history which he was
repeating to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>“And what were my first impressions on entering
into the presence of Mr. Hatfield and Lady Georgiana?
I scarcely know now&mdash;for I remember that the lady
snatched me to her bosom&mdash;folded me in a fond embrace&mdash;covered
me with kisses&mdash;and even wept over
me. It was the first time I had ever seen her, to my
recollection. Mr. Hatfield then embraced me in his
turn, and with as much fervour as if he had been the
Mr. Rainford whom I had expected to meet and to
behold! I was then, as I just now reckoned, between
ten and eleven when all this happened; and it struck
me&mdash;I recollect it well&mdash;that there was a considerable
likeness between Mr. Rainford and Mr. Hatfield:&mdash;but
then Mr. Rainford had light hair, and Mr. Hatfield
black,&mdash;Mr. Rainford had reddish whiskers, and those
of Mr. Hatfield were dark as jet. Yes: those were
my ideas at the time; but I suppose that they were the
offspring of a delusion. Nevertheless, when I call to
mind the features of that Mr. Rainford who was so
good to me in my infancy, it even seems now that I
can recollect a resemblance between them and the
countenance of my own father such as it now is. Still,
this is most probably mere fancy;&mdash;and I wish to
arrive at truths, not indulge in idle speculations. Well,
then&mdash;to go back to that interview,&mdash;that first interview
between myself and those who have since turned
out to be my parents,&mdash;I can call to mind each look
they bestowed upon me&mdash;each word they uttered.
They told me that they were my uncle and my aunt&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
they were rich, and intended to have me to
live with them altogether thenceforth, and be recognised
as their heir&mdash;that Mr. Rainford had gone upon
a long, long voyage to settle in a far-off land, whence
perhaps he should never return&mdash;and that they would
supply the place of the parents whom I had lost in
my infancy and of the generous friend who had thus
quitted his native shores for ever! There was so much
in the voice&mdash;manner&mdash;and language of Mr. Hatfield
which reminded me of Mr. Rainford, that this circumstance
materially consoled me for the deprivation of
my long-loved protector; and I was moreover just at
that age when kindness, handsome clothes, indulgence,
and the change of scene which immediately followed,
were fully calculated to attach me to those who gave
me so many enjoyments. Thus, I am afraid that I
was ungrateful to the memory of Mr. Rainford&mdash;by
loving Mr. Hatfield too soon and too well,&mdash;for I could
not then suspect that he was my father;&mdash;no&mdash;nor
did I ever until the truth burst so suddenly on me this
day! But, ah! it was nature which prompted that
feeling;&mdash;and I remember well how joyous and happy I
was when told, on the occasion of that first interview,
that thenceforth I must bear the name of <em>Hatfield</em>!”</p>

<p>Here he paused again, as if in doubt whether he
had omitted any detail, reminiscence, or incident which
should constitute a link in the narrative that he was
endeavouring, in his progressive thoughts, to render
as complete as possible;&mdash;and solemnly&mdash;profoundly
interesting would it have been for a human observer,
himself unobserved, to have contemplated that fine
and handsome young man, thus devoting the hours
when others slept to the task of tracing, by memorial
efforts, his career from the days of infancy to the
present moment! But no eye beheld him save that of
Him who beholdeth all things, and who sleepeth
never!</p>

<p>“Scarcely had I thus been taken into the care of
Mr. and Lady Georgiana Hatfield,”&mdash;it was thus he
proceeded in his continuous meditations,&mdash;“when we
repaired to the Continent. Having travelled through
France, we crossed the Alps, and entered the delicious
land of Italy. The Sardinian States were traversed
by us in that leisurely manner which allowed us to
view every thing worthy of inspection;&mdash;for some
weeks we stayed at Florence, the capital of the
beauteous Grand Duchy of Tuscany;&mdash;thence we
journeyed to Rome,&mdash;and for several months did we
sojourn in the Eternal City. But the health of a
young man who was with us, and whose name was
Jacob Smith, required a change of climate. Mr.
Hatfield was deeply attached to this youth, who, on
his side, treated my father with the utmost deference
and devotedness. The Roman physicians recommended
the genial air of Montoni; and we accordingly removed
to the sovereign city of Castelcicala. But Jacob
Smith appeared to have some secret sorrow preying
upon him; and he pined away before our very eyes.
Yes&mdash;he <em>had</em> a secret source of grief: for I remember
well now, that one night he uttered dreadful screams
and ejaculations in his sleep, which awoke and alarmed
me&mdash;for I slept in the next room to him. I recollect
that I rushed in, fearful lest his chamber had caught
on fire; and that before I could arouse him, he shrieked
forth in thrilling tones&mdash;‘<em>Old Death&mdash;Benjamin
Bones&mdash;my father! No&mdash;no!</em>’&mdash;Poor fellow, he died
soon afterwards; and I wept much&mdash;for he was
always kind and good to me! But that ejaculation of
‘<em>Old Death&mdash;Benjamin Bones!</em>’ even then seemed
to touch some chord within my soul, as if awaking a
long dormant but vague reminiscence: and now again,
that name of <em>Benjamin Bones</em>&mdash;that frightful appellation
of <em>Old Death</em>,&mdash;Oh! they do not seem so unfamiliar
to me as if I had never heard them mentioned
but that once, and by the lips of Jacob Smith. Were
not those names, in fact, in some way associated with
recollections of a much earlier date? Did I never
hear those names pronounced in my earliest boyhood?
It appears to me that I did; and yet I vainly&mdash;oh!
how vainly endeavour to plunge my eager glances
through the mist&mdash;the dense, dark mist, which envelopes
that idea,&mdash;reducing the thought to a suspicion
so dim and vague that I dare not adopt it as a link in
this history of mine! And yet why does the name of
<em>Old Death</em> produce a kind of shuddering within me,
as if the influence of a very early recollection still
partially remained? Wherefore does the appellation
of <em>Benjamin Bones</em> seem more familiar to me, than I
can possibly conceive a reason for? There are moments
when I appear to obtain the least glimmering&mdash;the
least scintillation of a light at the remote profundity
of this mystery,&mdash;a light which for an instant seems
to promise an elucidation of all I wish to know in
that respect, and then becomes suddenly extinguished&mdash;leaving
me in a deeper and darker uncertainty than
before!”</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield pressed his hands violently to his
forehead, as if to awaken recollections that slumbered
too soundly to be otherwise aroused: but he could not
conjure up nor evoke a single idea that was calculated
to throw any light on the obscurity which enveloped
every thing in his mind respecting the two names, the
utterance whereof thrilled to his very soul.</p>

<p>“What means that horrible phrase&mdash;<em>Old Death</em>?”
he asked himself a hundred times: “and is it in any
way connected with the name of <em>Benjamin Bones</em>?
Is the phrase a name itself likewise? and if so, are
<em>Old Death</em> and <em>Benjamin Bones</em> one and the same
person? Why should those names produce upon me
a disagreeable effect, as if I suddenly came in contact
with a loathsome snake? I know not:&mdash;and yet it is
so! The more I ponder upon that night when poor
Jacob Smith shrieked out in his sleep&mdash;the more vivid
do my recollections become concerning the horror that
convulsed him, and the piercing&mdash;tense anguish which
marked his tone! Oh! then, there must have been
something dreadful&mdash;appalling&mdash;terrible in the associations
which the names of <em>Old Death</em> and <em>Benjamin
Bones</em> conjured up in the young man’s mind at the
time; and this Benjamin Bones must have been a bad&mdash;a
very bad person. But wherefore do I say ‘<em>must
have been</em>?’ May he not be alive now? In a word&mdash;what
do I know of him? Nothing! nothing! And
yet&mdash;and yet, something seems to tell me that I did
know more of him once than I do now! Perhaps,
when I was a child, I heard evil things said of him,&mdash;things
which have long since fled from my mind, leaving
only a general and very faint impression behind&mdash;and
that impression unfavourable to the object of it.
Let me not then dwell longer on this point of my narrative&mdash;that
narrative which I seek to compile from
the myriads of ideas that until this night have been all
scattered in my brain&mdash;never concentrated and reduced
to order until now! Yes&mdash;from that chaos of memories,
I have succeeded in rescuing reminiscences and
thoughts sufficient to form a somewhat continuous and
connected history;&mdash;and heaven must guide me, if its
will so be, sooner or later to clear up all that is still
obscure, and gratify my craving&mdash;ardent curiosity
unto the fullest extent! But wherefore am I devoured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
with this burning desire to know all that there may be
to know relative to myself? Alas! ’tis in my nature:
the incident of the day just past has suddenly aroused
that curiosity within me&mdash;for I feel, I have an innate
conviction that there is a mystery attached to my
birth, the elucidation of which must some day or another
have a powerful influence upon my destinies!
And oh! if it should prove that I am pursuing investigations
which must end in stamping <em>me</em> with the
stigma of illegitimacy, and bringing to light the dishonour
of my mother&mdash;&mdash;But, no&mdash;no! this cannot
be! My father would not otherwise have given me
the solemn assurance that my mother is <em>an angel of
innocence and purity, and never has been guilty of
weakness or frailty</em>!”</p>

<p>Again he paused: and now he arose from his seat,
and paced the room for several minutes&mdash;agitated by
the fear that he was militating against the wishes, or
perhaps even the interests, of kind parents, by venturing
to give full rein to the impetuous curiosity that
had seized upon him. And yet&mdash;as ere now observed&mdash;he
could not restrain the ardour of that sentiment,
which, more powerful than himself, engulphed him in
its onward, eddying influence.</p>

<p>Resuming his seat,&mdash;resuming likewise his meditative
attitude,&mdash;and with his countenance again buried
in his hands,&mdash;the young man took up the chain of
his thoughts from that point where he had suddenly
broken off to reflect on the secret and mysterious influence
which the words <em>Old Death</em> and <em>Benjamin
Bones</em> produced upon him.</p>

<p>“I reached in my mental narrative that epoch when
poor Jacob Smith died. I was then about thirteen&mdash;a
little more than thirteen; and I mourned sincerely for
him. Frequently did I visit his grave in the beautiful
cemetery where he was buried; and often&mdash;often as
I wandered on the bank of the clear and broad Ferretti,
down to whose chrystal margin that cemetery
stretched,&mdash;often did I marvel who that departed
youth was&mdash;and what secret tie might have linked
him to Mr. Hatfield! Years passed rapidly away,&mdash;years
unmarked by any incident on which my mind
need pause to ponder: I grew up&mdash;happy, gay, and
seldom thinking of the past. The bright and shining
future&mdash;decked with all the glorious and golden hues
which a sanguine imagination could devise&mdash;was ever
the topic of my thoughts. Oh! well do I recollect
that when between eighteen and nineteen years of
age, I began to comprehend the affairs of the great
world&mdash;to study well the political condition of nations&mdash;and
to observe that the State of Castelcicala languished
under the tyranny of the Grand Duke Angelo.
Then I longed to become a hero&mdash;to have an army at
my command&mdash;to achieve the independence, not only
of Castelcicala, but of all Italy. These aspirations
continued until I became an enthusiast in the cause of
freedom; and though of English birth, yet deeply&mdash;sincerely
did I sympathise with the generous-hearted
Castelcicalans, when the treachery and despotism of
the Grand Duke Angelo called a mighty Austrian
army into the State, to besiege and overawe the
capital! But Providence suddenly sent a champion
to rescue a fine country and a noble people from the
power of the invaders. No Castelcicalan native&mdash;no
Italian patriot watched the career of Richard Markham
with so much anxiety, such burning hope, and
such deep suspense as I! When I heard those persons
who were his best-wishers in their hearts,
shake their heads and declare that the Constitutional
Cause could not possibly succeed with so
youthful a leader and such slender resources, I
thought otherwise:&mdash;yes&mdash;I thought otherwise&mdash;because
I wished otherwise. Then as victory after
victory marked the progress of the hero&mdash;Estella,
Piacere, and Abrantani giving their names to the
triumphs of the Constitutional Army,&mdash;I longed&mdash;Oh!
I longed to fly into the presence of the conqueror,
and implore him to permit me to wield a sword in the
same cause. But we were then prisoners as it were
within the walls of Montoni, which was besieged by
the Austrians; and while all was dismay&mdash;confusion&mdash;and
terror around, I alone seemed to entertain a conviction
as to the result. Nor was I mistaken: the
Constitutional Army, under the command of Richard
Markham, advanced to raise the siege&mdash;and beneath
the walls of Montoni was fought the most sanguinary
action of modern times. From morning’s dawn till
the evening, lasted that terrific encounter;&mdash;but at
eight o’clock on that evening the capital was delivered.
Yet why should I now dwell on all these incidents,&mdash;why
detail to myself all that followed?&mdash;the flight of
the Grand Duke Angelo&mdash;the accession of Alberto
to the ducal throne&mdash;and the subsequent arrival of
Richard Markham, then Prince of Montoni, to settle
with his lovely wife, the Princess Isabella, in the
capital of the State which owed so much to him!
Never&mdash;never shall I forget the exuberant joy which
greeted his return to Montoni; and to render that
day the more remarkable, the Grand Duke, his father-in-law,
had convoked for the first time the Chambers
of Senators and Deputies, instituted by the
new Constitution previously promulgated! And
the first act of those Chambers was to recognise
the Prince as heir-apparent to the throne; while the
Grand Duke appointed him Captain-General of the
Castelcicalan Army&mdash;that army which he had led to
conquest and to glory! It was a joyous and a memorable
day for me when Mr. Hatfield and Lady
Georgiana, having left their cards at the palace, received
an invitation to a ball given by the Grand Duke
and Duchess to celebrate the arrival of their son-in-law
and beauteous daughter;&mdash;for I was permitted to
accompany those whom I at that time believed to be
my uncle and my aunt. Then did I find myself in
the presence of Royalty for the first time; and I was
agreeably disappointed and surprised to discover that
condescension, affability, and great kindness of manner
were fully compatible with the loftiest rank,&mdash;for such
was the bearing of the Grand Duke Alberto and his
Duchess, as well as of the Prince and Princess of
Montoni. From that time forth I have become almost
a worshipper of his Royal Highness the Prince,&mdash;an
enthusiastic admirer of his genius, his character, and
his glorious achievements:&mdash;to me he appears unrivalled
as a warrior, faultless as a statesman, and estimable
as a man,&mdash;endowed with every virtue&mdash;every
qualification that can ennoble him not only as an individual
who created rank and honours for himself by
his high merits, but who is also the most splendid
specimen of Nature’s aristocracy that the world has
ever yet seen!”</p>

<p>The young man raised his head as he reached this
climax in his thoughts; and as the light of the lamp
beamed upon his countenance, it was reflected in eyes
brilliant with enthusiasm and with the glow excited
by a heart swelling with the loftiest aspirations.</p>

<p>“Oh! shall I ever be able to raise myself to eminence?”
he exclaimed, clasping his hands together, as
if in earnest appeal to heaven: “may I hope ever to
make for myself a name which the whole world shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
pronounce with respect and admiration? But first&mdash;first,”
he continued, still speaking aloud and in an excited
tone,&mdash;“I must satisfy this ardent curiosity which
has seized upon me! Wherefore all these dreadful
mysteries?&mdash;wherefore do not my parents acknowledge
me as their son, if I be really legitimate?&mdash;why am I
still to pass as their nephew? Are they ashamed of
me?&mdash;have I ever done aught to bring disgrace upon
their name? No&mdash;no: and they gave me that name&mdash;their
own name of Hatfield, and of their own accord!
But who was the good woman, Sarah Watts, that I
used to call by the title of <em>mother</em>?&mdash;why was I entrusted
in my infancy to her care?&mdash;for what motive
was it that my parents never took charge of me
until I was upwards of ten years of age?&mdash;and who
was that kind and generous Mr. Rainford that I loved
so much, and whom I have not now heard of for many
long&mdash;long years? Oh! I must find the solutions of
all these mysteries&mdash;the answers to all these questions!
Yes:&mdash;whatever be the result,&mdash;whatever be the consequences,
I must tear away the veil which conceals
so much of <em>the past</em> from my view!”</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield rose from his chair as he pronounced
these last words with strong emphasis; and,
beginning to pace the room in an agitated manner, he
was repeating his impassioned determination to clear
up all that was at present obscure and dark, when a
remorse struck to his soul&mdash;producing a sensation that
made him reel and stagger!</p>

<p>For had not he said to Lady Georgiana but a few
hours previously&mdash;“<em>I now know that you art my
mother&mdash;and I care to know nothing more! Never&mdash;never
shall I question you concerning the past: the
enjoyment of the present, and the hope which gilds the
future&mdash;these are enough for me!</em>”</p>

<p>And had not he said to his sire&mdash;“<em>By what right do
I dare to question the conduct of parents who have
ever treated me to kindly? No&mdash;my dear father&mdash;I
seek not any explanation at your hands&mdash;I am content
to obey your wishes in all things.</em>”</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield was a young man of fine principles
and noble feelings; and the solemn nature of those
assurances, striking with suddenness and force upon his
mind, filled him with bitter regret that he should have
ever thought of violating such sacred pledges.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!” he exclaimed in an impassioned manner,&mdash;“I
will not play so vile a part towards my
parents&mdash;I will not render myself so little in my own
estimation! Let me endeavour, rather, to fly from my
thoughts&mdash;to crush, subdue, stifle this wicked curiosity
which has seized upon me&mdash;let me indeed be contented
with the happiness of the present and the hopes of the
future, and not seek to tear away the veil that conceals
the past! The secrets of my parents must be solemnly
preserved from violation by my profane hands:&mdash;how
dare I&mdash;presumptuous and wilful young man that I
am,&mdash;how dare I institute a search into the private
matters and histories of the authors of my being?”</p>

<p>Then&mdash;enraged and indignant with himself, in one
sense, and satisfied with the timeous decision to which
he had come in another&mdash;Charles Hatfield hastened
to retire to his bed, where the exhaustion and fatigue
of long and painful thought soon sealed his eyelids in
slumber.</p>

<p>But will he succeed in crushing the sentiments of
curiosity which have been awakened within him?&mdash;or
is he already preparing the way, by this night’s
long meditation, for a vast amount of sorrow to fall
upon and be endured by many?</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXV">CHAPTER CXXV.<br />

<span class="medium">THE PROJECTED RAILWAY COMPANY.</span></h2>

<p>It was striking ten by all the clocks at the West
End, on the morning of the day following the incidents
which have occupied the five preceding chapters,
when a cab drove with insane speed along a
fashionable street, in that district of the metropolis
just alluded to; and having stopped at the door of
the best house in the said street, out leapt Mr. Bubbleton
Styles, with a large roll of papers in his hand.</p>

<p>“I told you that you would not do it by ten
o’clock,” said this gentleman, addressing the reproach,
accompanied by an angry look, to the cab-man.</p>

<p>“Not done it by ten, sir!” exclaimed the astonished
and indignant driver: “vy, it’s on’y jest a-finished
strikin’ by every blessed clock in this here part o’ the
town.”</p>

<p>“Just finished striking!” cried Mr. Styles, pulling
out his watch: “it’s a minute and a quarter past ten,
I tell you. Here’s your fare.”</p>

<p>“Two bob, all the vay from Crosby Chambers!”
growled the man, turning the money over and over in
a discontented fashion in the palm of his hand:
“come, come&mdash;that von’t jest do, if <em>you</em> please, sir.
You promised me three bob if I brought you here by
ten&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you did not fulfil the bargain,” sharply interrupted
Mr. Styles, as he hurried up the steps of
the large house and knocked at the door, which was
immediately opened by a servant in such a splendid&mdash;outrageously
splendid livery&mdash;that no other indication
was required to distinguish the mansion of a
<em>parvenu</em>&mdash;or, in other words, a vulgar upstart. “Is
Mr. Podgson at home?” demanded Mr. Styles.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Walk in, sir. What name, sir?” were
the hurried phrases which came from the domestic’s
lips.</p>

<p>“Vell, ain’t ye a-going to pay us the extra bob,
you gent?” cried the cab-man, as he mounted sulkily
to his seat and drew a sack round his knees although
it was in the middle of summer&mdash;so strong is the force
of habit.</p>

<p>Mr. Styles deigned no reply to this derogatory adjuration;
but, having given his card to the servant,
he entered the great man’s great house&mdash;while the
cab drove away at a pace which seemed to intimate
that the horse had become as sulky as its master.</p>

<p>The hall was very magnificent: but every thing
was new. The statues&mdash;the vases&mdash;the marble pillars&mdash;the
gilding on the doors that opened into the
ground-floor apartments&mdash;even to the liveries of the
servants lounging about,&mdash;all was new! Mr. Styles
was shown into a small parlour, where the pictures&mdash;the
mirrors&mdash;the mantle ornaments&mdash;the furniture&mdash;the
carpet&mdash;the hangings,&mdash;every thing there was
likewise new. The paint scarcely seemed to have
dried, nor the putty in the window-frames to have
hardened.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the domestic, who had left Mr.
Styles alone during that interval, returned with the
intimation that Mr. Podgson would see him at once;
and the railway projector was forthwith conducted up
a wide and handsome marble stair-case&mdash;through a
splendidly furnished ante-room&mdash;into a sumptuous
apartment, where the great man was seated at a table
covered with railway plans, letters, maps, newspapers,
visitors’ cards, and Acts of Parliament, all scattered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
about in a confusion that had been admirably well
<em>studied</em> and <em>purposely arranged</em>.</p>

<p>The impression of the <em>newness</em> of every thing in the
mansion was strengthened in the mind of Mr. Bubbleton
Styles at every pace which he had taken from the
hall-door into the room where he now found himself.
It appeared as if Mr. Podgson&mdash;or Mr. Podgson’s wife&mdash;or
both, had endeavoured to the utmost of human
power to crowd the apartments, the stair-cases, the
landings, and, in fact, every nook and corner, with as
many evidences of wealth as possible. Fine paintings
by old masters, set in bran new glittering frames, were
hung in the very worst lights, and without the least
regard to their relative styles, colouring, or subjects.
Each room had two or three time-pieces in it; and as
they were not in accordance with respect to the hour,
Mr. Bubbleton Styles’s ideas of precision and punctuality
received a severe shock when he heard ten o’clock
proclaimed half-a-dozen different times during the first
twenty minutes which elapsed after he first set foot in
the mansion. In a word, the entire aspect of the house
was a reflection of the vulgar, untasteful, and self-sufficient
minds of the “stuck-up people” who, having
grown suddenly rich, did not know how to render their
dwelling elegant and comfortable without making it
gaudy and ridiculously ostentatious in its appointments.</p>

<p>Mr. Podgson was a short, stout, thick-set man, with
an enormous stomach, a very wide back, and little
stumpy legs. His head seemed to be stuck on his
shoulders without the intervening aid of any neck at
all; and his features were coarsely ugly, and totally
inexpressive of even the slightest spark of intelligence.
His tongue appeared to be much too large for his
mouth, his speech being remarkably disagreeable: indeed,
his free utterance seemed to be impeded as if he
were always sucking a large lollipop, or had an enormous
quid of tobacco stuck in his cheek. When he
walked, it was with the most ungainly waddle that
can possibly be conceived; and his clothes, though no
doubt made by a fashionable tailor, sate upon him just
as if they had been thrown on with a pitch-fork.
Had this man been invested with regal robes,&mdash;had he
arrayed himself in the Tyrian purple which Rome’s
Emperors were wont to wear,&mdash;he could not have
looked otherwise than a low vulgarian,&mdash;which he was!</p>

<p>We shall not pause for a moment to give any account
of the rise of Mr. Podgson from obscurity to
that renown which the sudden acquisition of great
wealth established for him. Having sprung from the
people, he turned against the people when he became
a rich man. His property enabled him to <em>purchase</em> a
borough; and the instant he found himself in Parliament,
he joined the Protectionists&mdash;the bitter enemies
of the popular cause!</p>

<p>Had this man taken his place amongst the Liberals,
we should not have remembered his physical ugliness
and his immense vulgarity of manners: we should
have admired and esteemed him. But <em>he</em> to associate
with aristocrats,&mdash;to squeeze that squat, podgy form
amongst the “exquisites” and the “exclusives” of the
West End,&mdash;to affect the most refined notions, and
ape every thing fashionable,&mdash;for <em>him</em> to do all this&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
it is really too ridiculous&mdash;too ludicrous&mdash;too
absurd to permit us to keep our countenance when we
think of it!</p>

<p>Persons cannot help being naturally vulgar, any
more than they can help being ugly: but the
vulgar should not thrust themselves into those scenes
and spheres where they are certain to stand out in
most ignoble prominency, thereby forcing on all beholders
the effect of the ludicrous contrast;&mdash;neither
should the ugly adopt such an awful swagger and
assume an air of such insufferable self-complacency as
to render themselves most disagreeably remarkable
and conspicuous.</p>

<p>Mr. Podgson had acquired his immense wealth by
railway speculations; and the disgusting sycophants
who invariably attach themselves to rich men with
weak minds, had nonsensically dubbed him the <em>Railway
Lion</em>! Had they called him the <em>Railway
Elephant</em>, in allusion to his unwieldy proportions&mdash;or
the <em>Railway Bear</em>, in reference to his manners&mdash;or the
<em>Railway Donkey</em>, in respect to his intelligence,&mdash;they
would have been more faithful to truth. But the
<em>Railway Lion</em> he was;&mdash;and it was now in the presence
of this tremendous animal that Mr. Bubbleton
Styles stood.</p>

<p>Without rising from his chair, Mr. Podgson, M.P.,
waved his hand with all the majesty of a stage-monarch;
and as this gesticulation was intended to be
a fashionable&mdash;no, a dignified mode of desiring Mr.
Bubbleton Styles to be seated, Mr. Bubbleton Styles
seated himself accordingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Podgson then stared very hard at his visitor;
and this was the Railway Lion’s method of intimating
that he was “all attention.”</p>

<p>“I believe, sir,” said Mr. Styles, in a very polite and
courteous manner&mdash;but without any thing like cringing
servility,&mdash;“I believe, sir, that you last night received
a letter from Alderman Tripes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! ah!” exclaimed Mr. Podgson, in his thick
voice: “I remember! My very particular and intimate
friend, Mr. Alderman Tripes, assures me in his
communication that you have a famous project on the
tappy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Podgson meant <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</em>&mdash;but could not precisely
achieve the correct pronunciation.</p>

<p>“And that project I shall have much pleasure in
submitting to you, sir,” added Mr. Styles, proceeding
to unfold the large roll of papers which he had brought
with him.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I don’t mind&mdash;that is, to obleege you, I’ll
just look over them,” said Mr. Podgson, in an indifferent&mdash;careless
way. “But,” he added, glancing
at the elegant watch which he drew with affected
negligence from his waistcoat pocket, “I’ve got an
appointment at a quarter to eleven&mdash;and I must be
punctual to the rendy-woo.”</p>

<p>Mr. Styles assured the great man that he would not
detain him a moment beyond the time named for the
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendez-vous</em>; and, spreading his plans and maps upon
the table, the small speculator began to explain his
objects and views to the large capitalist.</p>

<p>“Who’s the engineer?” enquired the latter: then,
looking at the corner of the plan, and perceiving the
name, he cried, “Oh! Dummerley&mdash;eh? Well&mdash;he’s
a good man&mdash;a very good man! I was talking to
Lord Noodleton the other day about him&mdash;Lord Noodleton
and me are intimate friends, you know&mdash;very
intimate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“His lordship has reason to be proud of your friendship,
sir,” observed Mr. Styles, adroitly availing himself
of the opportunity to pay a compliment.</p>

<p>“Hem! well&mdash;Noodleton <em>does</em> seem grateful,” said,
the Railway Lion, glancing complacently at one of his
boots. “But, about this spec of yours, Mr. Styles?
Shall you have a good list of Provisional Committee?”</p>

<p>“First-rate, sir&mdash;especially if you will condescend
to head it,” returned the small speculator with a bow
to the great one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>“Well&mdash;we shall see!” exclaimed Mr. Podgson.
“But first as to the probability of success? Let me
just make a calculation or two&mdash;nothing is done without
calculations; and I’m rayther quick at figures.
Now, your capital is &pound;8,000,000 in 400,000 shares.
Good! Deposit, &pound;2 2<em>s.</em> per share. Good again! But
about the expenses and receipts&mdash;the outlay and the
incomings, on which we may reckon with certainty?
Let me see&mdash;twice two’s four&mdash;and twice four’s eight&mdash;and
nine times nine’s eighty one&mdash;and eleven times
eleven’s a hundred and twenty one&mdash;that gives us five
hundred thousand there&mdash;then there’s two hundred
thousand here&mdash;&mdash;Well!” cried the great man, suddenly
interrupting himself in the midst of calculations which,
though they were as unintelligible as the Chinese language
to Mr. Styles, it is to be hoped were a trifle more
comprehensive to the gentleman who was making
them in a musing, half-whispering tone, and counting
mysteriously on his fingers at the same time:&mdash;“well!”
he cried, suddenly desisting from the arithmetical process
with the satisfied air of a man who had arrived
at a conviction by means of the most subtle considerations,&mdash;“well,
I <em>do</em> think it will succeed, Mr. Styles&mdash;and
I&mdash;&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will condescend to become our Chairman, Mr.
Podgson?” said the other, finishing the sentence which
the Railway Lion’s extreme modesty and sensitive
bashfulness had left thus incomplete. “I am well
aware, sir,&mdash;and the public are well aware likewise&mdash;that
you have entered into the grand affairs of the Railway
World with no interested motive,&mdash;that you never
took a single share with the idea of making it
a means of gain! No&mdash;sir&mdash;your views have been
wholly and solely to benefit your fellow countrymen.
Indeed, you yourself have proclaimed as much in your
place in the House of Commons&mdash;and the civilised
world echoes with the mighty truth! You are a
benefactor, sir&mdash;a philanthropist&mdash;a patriot; and no
sordid ideas ever influenced you! It is upon this
ground, and on this ground only,&mdash;without even
venturing to hint that there will be five thousand
shares reserved for the Chairman and Provisional
Committee-men, and that they are certain to rise to a
high premium the moment they are issued,&mdash;without
daring to mention such a thing in <em>your</em> presence, sir&mdash;but
relying solely on your known readiness to
countenance every fair&mdash;legitimate&mdash;and honourable
undertaking which promises to benefit our fellow-men
and produce fifty per cent. profits,&mdash;’tis upon these
grounds, Mr. Podgson, that I solicit you to become
the Chairman of the Grand British Longitudinal
Railway!”</p>

<p>Mr. Styles narrowly watched the effect which this
magniloquent oration produced upon the Railway
Lion; and as he beheld the fat, ignoble, vulgar countenance
of that stupendous animal slowly expanding
with satisfaction, he knew that he was as sure of
nailing Mr. Podgson for a Chairman, as he was sure of
seeing Captain O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Frank Curtis
in the afternoon at three o’clock to partake of chops
and sherry at Crosby Hall Chambers.</p>

<p>Nor was Mr. Bubbleton Styles mistaken. In as
dignified a manner as it was in his nature to assume,
and in as good English as it was in his power to
employ, the great Mr. Podgson gave his assent to the
proposition; and Mr. Styles was already in the midst
of a set speech of thanks, when a pompous-looking
livery-servant entered the room.</p>

<p>“Well, Thomas&mdash;what now?” demanded Mr. Podgson.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” answered the domestic, whose countenance
denoted offended dignity and wounded pride,
“there’s a troublesome gentleman down below who
says he must and will have a hinterview with you,
sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Must and will!” ejaculated the Railway Lion,
sinking back in his chair with an amazement which
could not have been greater had some one rushed in
to tell him that the Chinese had invaded England and
made a Mandarin Lord Mayor of London.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;must and will!” groaned the horrified
domestic.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I never heard such impudence in my life!”
exclaimed Mr. Bubbleton Styles, affecting the deepest
indignation&mdash;a little piece of hypocrisy which completely
won the Railway Lion’s heart.</p>

<p>“And does this <em>person</em>&mdash;for you was wrong to call
him a <em>gentleman</em>, John,” said Mr. Podgson, somewhat
recovering from his stupefaction,&mdash;“does this <em>person</em>,
who <em>must</em> and <em>will</em> see <em>me</em>&mdash;<em>me</em>, John&mdash;<em>me</em>, Mr. Styles,&mdash;does
this <em>person</em>, I say, give his name or business?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, he gave me his card,” returned the
flunkey; “and here it be.”</p>

<p>The high and mighty Railway Lion took the
pasteboard between the tips of his thumb and fore-finger;
and having glanced at it, he tossed it with
sublime scorn into a waste-paper basket, exclaiming
in his rough, disagreeable voice, “Mr. Clarence Villiers&mdash;eh?
Well&mdash;I suppose I’d better see him. Don’t
move, Mr. Styles: you shall just see how I’ll serve the
insolent fellow that <em>must</em> and <em>will</em> have an interview
with <small>ME</small>!”</p>

<p>The domestic retreated without turning his back
upon his master,&mdash;or, in other words, stepped backwards
to the door, as if he were quitting the presence
of Royalty; and Mr. Styles again vented his well-affected
indignation and surprise that “people should
be so bold and inconsiderate as to obtrude themselves
into the presence of Mr. Podgson in such a manner.”</p>

<p>“Bold and inconsiderate!” repeated the Railway
Lion. “It is owdacious and intolerable.”</p>

<p>“Shameful!” cried Mr. Styles.</p>

<p>“Perfectly insupportable!” vociferated Mr. Podgson.</p>

<p>“Monstrous in the extreme!” exclaimed Mr. Bubbleton
Styles, actually working himself up into a
passion.</p>

<p>“But I’ll put a stop to it!” continued the Railway
Lion, dealing a tremendous blow with his clenched fist
upon the table: “I’ll bring in a Bill next Session,
Mr. Styles, to protect public men from insolent intrusion!”</p>

<p>“It will serve the scoundrels quite right, my dear
sir,” responded the small speculator, approvingly.</p>

<p>“By Gad! I’ll pay the reskels off for it!” exclaimed
the mighty man, who could command hundreds
of thousands of pounds, but not the minutest
fraction of his temper.</p>

<p>The door now opened again; and the pompous domestic,
whose countenance was expressive of deep
indignation, ushered in the reader’s old friend&mdash;Mr.
Clarence Villiers,&mdash;now a fine, handsome man, in the
prime of life.</p>

<p>“Well, sir&mdash;and what do <em>you</em> want?” demanded
Mr. Podgson, with all the overbearing insolence of a
contemptible <em>parvenu</em>.</p>

<p>“In the first place, sir,” replied Clarence, speaking
in a firm but gentlemanly tone, and glancing towards
the servant who lingered near the door, “I must take
the liberty of advising you to recommend your lacquey,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
to treat at least with respect, if not with courtesy,
those persons whom business may bring to your house;
for I can assure you that it required no ordinary forbearance
on my part to restrain my hand from laying
this cane across his shoulders.”</p>

<p>“What, sir&mdash;you dare, sir&mdash;&mdash;” stammered Mr.
Podgson, his vast, ignoble countenance becoming the
colour of scarlet.</p>

<p>“I dare chastise any one who is insolent to me, be
he who or what he may, sir,” answered Villiers, in a
very significant way, and in so determined a tone, too,
that the pompous domestic evaporated and the Railway
Lion was struck speechless with amazement&mdash;for
he felt as if he were literally bearded in his den!
“Being myself a gentleman by birth and education,
and I hope in manners and conduct, I am accustomed
to treat my equals with courtesy and my inferiors
with kindness; and I will tolerate insult from neither.
But enough of that subject, Mr. Podgson,” continued
Villiers: “the object of my visit is soon explained.
For many years I have enjoyed a confidential situation
in the service of the Earl of Ellingham&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! I really beg your pardon, Mr. Villiers!” exclaimed
the Railway Lion, with a start as if the piles
of a voltaic battery had suddenly been applied to his
unwieldy carcase. “I wasn’t aware that you knew
Lord Ellingham&mdash;or else&mdash;&mdash;But pray take a chair,
Mr. Villiers.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir&mdash;I would rather stand,” answered
Clarence, in a cold&mdash;almost contemptuous tone; for
he saw full well that this sudden politeness was not
paid to <em>himself</em>, but to his connexion with aristocracy.
“Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Podgson, I returned from
the country by the Western Provinces Railway; and
I was most anxious to reach London at the usual
hour for the arrival of that particular train, inasmuch
as the business which I had in hand for my noble employer
was urgent and pressing. Conceive, then, my
annoyance when the train stopped for three quarters
of an hour at a midway station&mdash;and without any
substantial reason. I remonstrated with the persons
on duty at that station: I even alighted, and saw the
clerk. Several other gentlemen, whose time was likewise
precious, joined me in my endeavours to prevent
farther delay,&mdash;but all in vain! And the excuse was&mdash;<em>that
the train had to wait for a basket of fruit, for
Mrs. Podgson, the lady of the Chairman of the Company</em>!
Now, sir, with all possible respect for the fair
sex, I submit to you that it is too bad&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And pray,sir,” interrupted the mighty Railway
Lion, flying into a furious passion, “why should <em>not</em>
my wife receive her fruit in time? By Gad! sir&mdash;the
train should have waited an hour for it, had it
been necessary; and it would have been as much as
the situations of the guard and engineer were worth
to have continued the journey without that basket!”</p>

<p>“Then you mean me to understand, sir,” said
Villiers, in a calm and gentlemanly tone which contrasted
strongly with the insolent, overbearing manner
of the purse-proud vulgarian-upstart,&mdash;“you
mean me to understand that you approve of the
conduct of your underlings in delaying a train containing
upwards of a hundred persons, to most of whom
time was precious, for the sake of a basket of fruit!”</p>

<p>“<em>Approve</em> of it!” cried the Railway Lion, astonished
that any doubt should exist upon the point:
“why&mdash;I <em>ordered</em> it! sir!”</p>

<p>“Then all I can say in comment upon such improper
conduct is&mdash;that if the Government and the Legislature
have permitted Companies to grasp these
tremendous monopolies in order to use them as instruments
of private convenience, without the slightest
regard to the time or feelings of the public,&mdash;then, I
for one,” continued Clarence Villiers emphatically,
“protest against so atrocious a despotism; and I
begin to be ashamed of my own country, when I find
it becoming the scene of a petty tyranny that would
raise an outcry even in Russia or Austria.”</p>

<p>“Oh! ho! the shoe pinches there&mdash;does it,” cried
Mr. Podgson, in the vulgar triumph effected by wealth
over the popular interests. “I tell you what, sir&mdash;and
I shall not attempt to disguise the matter:&mdash;we <em>monopolists</em>,
as you call us, have got the railways in our
own hands&mdash;and we mean to keep ’em&mdash;aye, and to
do with ’em just as we like! Do you know how many
hundred miles of railway I’ve got under my control?
Ask the first person you happen to meet&mdash;and you’ll
be sure to find out. Well&mdash;do you think I won’t use
my rights and privileges,&mdash;I may almost say <em>prerogatives</em>&mdash;eh,
Mr. Styles?”</p>

<p>“Oh! decidedly, my dear sir,” exclaimed that gentleman,
approvingly.</p>

<p>“Well,” resumed the Railway Lion,&mdash;“do you think
I won’t use my prerogatives as I choose and fancy?
If Mrs. Podgson wants even so trifling a thing as a
new-laid egg from any particular station, the train
shall wait for it. Talk to me about people’s time&mdash;what
the devil do I care for it? People must put up
with things as they find ’em. They can’t help themselves:
we’ve knocked all the coaches off the roads&mdash;and
you have no alternative but to go with us. But
perhaps, when a train is late at starting, or when it is
kept as it was yesterday, some of you knowing gentlemen
will be after taking a post-chaise at the Company’s
expense? I’d just advise you to do it! You’d
have to sue us for the amount&mdash;and we’d ruin you in
return. To recover five guineas you should have to
pay as many hundreds in law costs. Why, sir&mdash;it is
perfect madness to think of fighting great Public Companies;&mdash;and
we’ll let the people know it too.”</p>

<p>Having arrived at this liberal and enlightened determination,
the Railway Lion ceased through sheer exhaustion,&mdash;the
volubility of passionate declamation not
suiting his guttural voice.</p>

<p>“Although, sir, I obtain at your hands no satisfaction
for the infamous delay to which the train was
subjected yesterday,” said Mr. Villiers, who had listened
with calm and gentlemanly attention to the
furious mouthings of the upstart,&mdash;“I am nevertheless
pleased that I should have taken the trouble to call
upon you in reference to the matter. I have learnt a
lesson which I had not expected. I find that the
sudden acquisition of wealth is calculated to set a man
who rises <em>from</em> the People, <em>against</em> the People; and
that monopoly is a more tremendous engine of oppression
in the hands of narrow-minded and self-sufficient
persons than even its greatest haters could have conceived.
I do not envy you your riches, sir&mdash;nor your
sovereign sway over many miles of railroad&mdash;no, nor
even the title with which a fulsome and contemptible
flattery has invested you:&mdash;for the poorest mechanic
who does his duty towards his fellow-creatures, is a
worthier and more estimable being than you.”</p>

<p>With these words&mdash;uttered not savagely, but in a
tone of firm and measured reproach&mdash;Clarence Villiers
retired from the presence of the Railway Lion, who
appeared for the moment to have had “a calf’s skin”
thrown about “his recreant limbs,” so astounded and
amazed was he at the language which his visitor had
<em>dared</em> to address to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<div id="i_057" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“This is the most atrocious proceeding I ever knew
in the whole course of my life!” at length exclaimed
Mr. Bubbleton Styles, who in reality had been much
amused by the scene.</p>

<p>“I suppose that the riff-raff&mdash;as I always call the
People&mdash;will be telling us next that railways are public
property!” cried Mr. Podgson: “but we’ll show
’em the difference&mdash;eh, Mr. Styles?&mdash;won’t we, Mr.
Styles?”</p>

<p>And the Railway Lion condescendingly thrust his
fingers in a jocular way into the small speculator’s
ribs;&mdash;and then the great man and the little man had
a hearty laugh together&mdash;that of the former being in
the boisterous “ho! ho! ho!” style, and that of the
latter in the more respectful and submissive “he! he!
he!” fashion.</p>

<p>Having got upon this very comfortable and pleasant
understanding together, Mr. Podgson and Mr. Styles
chatted for about a quarter of an hour respecting the
new railway scheme: and the latter took his departure,
highly delighted with the reception he had experienced
and the success of his visit.</p>

<p>Punctually as the clock struck three that afternoon,
did Captain O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Curtis present
themselves at the office in Crosby Hall Chambers;
and as the third stroke was proclaimed by the churches
in the neighbourhood, they entered the speculator’s
private room, where that gentleman was seated at the
table with his watch in his hand.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Mr. Styles, returning the watch
to his pocket: “this is business-like&mdash;and I am well
pleased. The chops, you perceive, are smoking hot&mdash;the
sherry, I know, is first-rate.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he did the honours of the table and
the two guests did honour to the meal. The chops
speedily disappeared&mdash;so did a bottle of wine; and a
second was already opened before a word had been
uttered on business matters.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen,” at length cried Mr. Styles; “I
will give you a toast. Here’s the health of our Chairman&mdash;the
Railway Lion!”</p>

<p>“No! you don’t mean to say&mdash;&mdash;” ejaculated Mr.
Curtis.</p>

<p>“Hould your tongue, Frank&mdash;and let Misther
Sthyles say whatever he chooses!” exclaimed the
captain. “Dhrink the toast, man&mdash;and that’s all
about it!”</p>

<p>“I can assure you, gentlemen,” continued the promoter
of the new concern, “that I have fulfilled the promise
which I made you yesterday. Podgson is ours!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>“Hooray!” vociferated Frank Curtis.</p>

<p>“Hur-rah-ah!” thundered Captain O’Blunderbuss.</p>

<p>“It is indeed a subject for gratulation,” said Mr.
Styles, “The next point I wish to speak to you
about is the prospectus, a proof of which I have received
from the printer. It would have been all ready
for issue by this time, only my interview with the
Railway Lion was prolonged far beyond the hour at
which I had expected to be back in the City again;&mdash;and
you may be sure that I was in no hurry when
engaged with <em>him</em>,” added Mr. Bubbleton Styles,
smiling significantly. “Here, you see,” he continued,
displaying the proof of the flaming prospectus which
he had drawn up,&mdash;“here is the glorious document.
It is sufficient to set the very Thames on fire. Never
were such magnificent promises&mdash;never such brilliant
hopes held out! And look&mdash;thirty-two names of the
most eminent Aldermen, merchants, Common Councilmen,
and gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;half of them have got F.R.S. to the end of
their names!” ejaculated Frank Curtis: “what the
deuce does that mean? And, by Jove!” he cried,
now completely beside himself with astonishment,&mdash;“this
is strange! Here’s the ‘<em>Secretary, Francis
Curtis, Esq., F.R.S., M.A., M.S.L.S., &amp;c. &amp;c.</em>’ My
dear friend Styles&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Patience&mdash;patience, Frank,” said that gentleman,
with bland complacency. “Those initials stand for
various honorary distinctions which give respectability
to the name. For instance, you are represented
as being a <em>Fellow of the Royal Society</em>, a <em>Master of
Arts</em>, and a <em>Member of Several Learned Societies</em>.
God bless you, my dear fellow! even the very <em>et
ceteras</em> have their weight in a Railway Prospectus.”</p>

<p>“But I am nothing of all that you describe!” ejaculated
Frank Curtis, surveying Mr. Styles with an expression
of amazement that was quite ludicrous.</p>

<p>“I am well aware of that,” answered the City gentleman,
coolly: “neither are half the Aldermen or
Common-Councilmen F.R.S.’s or any thing else&mdash;unless
it is A.S.S.’s. But no Railway scheme can be
got up without this kind of <em>gammon</em>&mdash;for that is precisely
the word; and an Alderman who would send a
poor devil to the treadmill for obtaining goods under
false pretences if he only represented himself as Jones
instead of Noakes, will himself assume any honorary
distinction that is calculated to gull the public. Look
at Alderman Higgs Higgs, for example’s sake! Glance
over the list of different Railway schemes&mdash;and
amongst the Provisional Committee-men belonging to
each you will see ‘<em>Higgs Higgs, Esq., Alderman,
F.R.S., &amp;c. &amp;c.</em>’ Even that consummate ass, Alderman
Sun, has dubbed himself in a similar fashion;&mdash;and
therefore I see no reason why Frank Curtis, Esq.,
or Captain Gorman O’Blunderbuss, should not be an
F.R.S. likewise.”</p>

<p>This explanation was highly satisfactory to the two
gentlemen last mentioned; and on the strength of it
they drank bumpers to the success of the projected
enterprise.</p>

<p>“I have duly registered the Company,” observed
Mr. Styles; “and I have had an interview with Dummerley,
the Engineer, this afternoon! Oh! I can
assure you that I have not been idle. Dummerley is
ready to swear that he has surveyed the whole line
from the south of England to the north of Scotland&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But how is that possible?” demanded Frank, again
lost in astonishment: for, crafty and cunning as he
was in petty trickeries, he was altogether bewildered in
the mazes of colossal swindles. “You only thought of
the plan a few days ago&mdash;and Dummerley would not
have even had time to travel the whole distance there
and back post haste&mdash;much less to survey it leisurely.”</p>

<p>“You are quite green in these matters, Frank,”
observed Mr. Styles.</p>

<p>“Green!” ejaculated Captain O’Blunderbuss: “be
Jasus! the Imerald Isle itself isn’t so green as my
frind Frank in cer-r-r-tain respicts. But it’s afther
enlightening him ye are, Misther Sthyles&mdash;and he’ll
be all the betther for the taching.”</p>

<p>“Dummerley is a regular good fellow, I can assure
you,” resumed the promoter. “‘<em>You will be the Engineer</em>,’
said I to him this afternoon: ‘<em>I told Podgson
that you would.</em>’&mdash;‘<em>Most certainly</em>,’ he replied.&mdash;‘<em>And
in case the Bill should be opposed in Committee, you
will be ready to swear that you particularly surveyed
the part of the line relative to which objections may be
raised?</em>’&mdash;‘<em>Oh! of course</em>,’ was his answer.&mdash;‘<em>And
you will also swear that your plans are perfectly
correct?</em>’&mdash;‘<em>As a matter of course</em>,’ he again replied.&mdash;‘<em>Well,
then</em>,’ said I, ‘<em>here’s a five pound note for you;
and now fall to work as hard as you can to get all
the plans up in such a business-like way that they
may look legitimate</em>.’&mdash;Dummerley accordingly took
himself off as happy as a prince; and thus every thing
goes on completely in our favour. But it is now
three minutes to five; and at five precisely I step into
the Hackney omnibus at the Flower-Pot,” added Mr.
Styles, looking at his watch for the hundredth time
during the last quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Frank Curtis and Captain O’Blunderbuss took the
hint and their departure; and the promoter of a
scheme for raising millions treated himself with a six-penny
ride in an omnibus as far as Cambridge Heath
Gate, in which suburban quarter this great man resided
in a six-roomed house, including the kitchens.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXVI">CHAPTER CXXVI.<br />

<span class="medium">ELUCIDATIONS.</span></h2>

<p>At the conclusion of the hundred and twenty-fourth
chapter we asked whether Charles Hatfield would succeed
in crushing the sentiments of curiosity that had
been awakened within him?</p>

<p>Alas! no&mdash;it was impossible!</p>

<p>His better feelings, aroused by the startling remembrance
of the assurances he had respectively given his
father and mother, had for a few hours triumphed
over that insatiable longing to penetrate into the mysteries
of the past:&mdash;but when he again found himself
alone in his chamber, in the silence of night, he could
not subdue the thoughts which forced themselves upon
him, and which were all connected with those mysteries.</p>

<p>Thus was it that we again find him pacing his
chamber while others slept,&mdash;pacing up and down in
an agitated and excited manner, and maintaining a
desperate struggle within his own soul.</p>

<p>For the irresistible temptation which beset him, was
to ponder once more and deeply on the incidents of his
early days, and to endeavour to retrieve from the
abysses of his memory any other recollections that
might be slumbering there. For the sake of the
pledge given to his mother&mdash;for the sake of the assurance
made to his father, he strove,&mdash;yes&mdash;sincerely,
ardently he strove&mdash;to vanquish that temptation: yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
he could not&mdash;human nature possessed not so grand a
power;&mdash;he might have ruled his actions by his will&mdash;but
his thoughts defied all controul.</p>

<p>Yielding, therefore, at length to their current, he
was whirled along by the same eddying tide of reflections
which had swept him through so considerable
a portion of the preceding night;&mdash;and now the efforts
of memory&mdash;by one of those superhuman strainings
which, while they seem as if they must break the very
fibres of the brain, also appear to evoke a sudden flash
from the depth of some profound cerebral cell,&mdash;those
powerful and painful efforts in a moment, as it were,
established a connexion between the name of <em>Benjamin
Bones</em> and <em>the murder of Tamar</em>!</p>

<p>Yes: Charles Hatfield suddenly became aware that
the name and the incident were in some way associated:&mdash;and
he necessarily supposed that, in his childhood,
he had heard facts mentioned which had created that
impression at the time, but the nature of which he
could not now for the life of him recall to memory.
This impression was probably vague even at the
period when it was engendered; because Charles recollected
full well that the utmost caution was adopted
by those around him not to discourse upon the particulars
of the foul murder in his presence, nor even to
respond otherwise than evasively to the questions he
put,&mdash;he being a mere child at the time.</p>

<p>As the young gentleman paced up and down, his
mind labouring with the new reminiscence which had
arisen within, it suddenly struck him that there were
means of informing himself of all and every detail of
that murder, whereof he at present entertained only a
vague and general impression of its atrocity. His
long absence on the continent had prevented him from
ever, even accidentally, falling in with an English book
of criminal annals, or a file of English newspapers, to
which he might have referred, had the thought struck
him so to do. But now what was to restrain him from
making those searches which would throw every light
on an occurrence of such fearful interest?</p>

<p>Scarcely was this idea conceived, when the means
of instantaneously carrying it into execution suggested
itself. For Charles Hatfield remembered that in the
well-stored library of the mansion he had observed a
complete set of the <cite>Annual Register</cite>, from the very
origin of that useful work until the most recent date
of its publication!</p>

<p>And now he trembled from head to foot&mdash;he literally
gasped for breath, at the thought of being enabled to
tear away the veil of mystery from at least one incident
which was so materially connected with his
childhood: for Tamar had been as a mother to him
during the few months that he was in her care!</p>

<p>There was in his soul a deep and yet undefined presentiment
that he stood on the threshold of strange
discoveries&mdash;that important revelations were about to
be made to him;&mdash;and, without being superstitious, he
bent to the influence of this solemn but dim forecasting&mdash;this
awe-inspiring but vague prescience.</p>

<p>Taking the lamp in his hand, he stole gently from
his chamber&mdash;descended the wide and handsome staircase&mdash;traversed
a long corridor, in the niches of which
stood beautiful specimens of sculpture&mdash;and entered
the spacious library.</p>

<p>On each side of the door was a marble statue as
large as life; and the young man started&mdash;but only
for a moment&mdash;as the white and motionless effigies
stood out suddenly as if it were from the deep darkness
which the lamp illumined. It was not that he had
forgotten such statues were there&mdash;nor that he was
positively frightened at their appearance:&mdash;but his
soul was influenced by one of those presentiments which
are of themselves superstitions in character&mdash;and moreover
he was on the point of seeking information relative
to the details of a foul and horrible murder.</p>

<p>Instantly recovering himself, and blushing at his
fears, he advanced into the library, closing the door
carefully behind him: then, approaching a particular
range of shelves, he reached down the <cite>Annual Register</cite>
for the year 1827.</p>

<p>In less than a minute he was seated at the table,
with the book opened at the proper place before him;&mdash;and
greedily&mdash;Oh! how greedily he plunged as it
were into its contents.</p>

<p>But&mdash;great heavens!&mdash;why starts he thus? What
discovery has he made?&mdash;what revelation has been
afforded him?</p>

<p>He learns, with a frightful sinking of the heart,
that Rainford was a highwayman&mdash;that he had been
executed at Horsemonger Lane Gaol&mdash;that he had
been resuscitated by some means or another with
which the writer was unacquainted&mdash;that he had reappeared
in London in the disguise of a Blackamoor&mdash;and
that he had received the royal pardon for all his
crimes. These details were incidentally given in the
course of the narrative of the foul murder of Tamar,
who was represented to have been Rainford’s wife;&mdash;and
now also Charles Hatfield discovered how terrific
was the connexion between the name of Benjamin
Bones and the assassination of that ill-fated daughter
of Israel. Yes&mdash;and he perceived, too, that <em>Benjamin
Bones</em> and <em>Old Death</em> were one and the same individual;&mdash;and
he shuddered from head to foot as he
perused&mdash;nay, almost rushed through the details of
the crime which had been committed nineteen years
previously in the subterranean cells belonging to a
house in Red Lion Street, Clerkenwell!</p>

<p>But Charles Hatfield is not satisfied with what he
has already <em>devoured</em>&mdash;for we can scarcely use the
word <em>read</em>:&mdash;his curiosity to know more has become
insatiable;&mdash;and guided by the hints and the observations
occurring in the narrative of the murder, he refers
to an earlier page in that volume, in order to
obtain a full and complete insight into the trial and
condemnation of Rainford&mdash;that Rainford whom he
had loved so well!</p>

<p>The whole particulars were given in detail and with
accuracy,&mdash;the robbery of Sir Christopher Blunt&mdash;the
capture of Rainford by Dykes and his myrmidons in
Lock’s Fields&mdash;the trial&mdash;the condemnation&mdash;and the
execution!</p>

<p>Charles read&mdash;read on with horrified feelings which
often threatened to get the better of him;&mdash;but there
was one point in the evidence which rivetted his attention.
Dykes, the officer, in explaining the mode in
which the highwayman had been taken into custody,
used these words:&mdash;“<em>When I and my people gained
admittance into the house in Brandon Street, the
prisoner was in bed with his mistress, a Jewess</em>.”</p>

<p>“Then,” thought Charles Hatfield immediately,
“Tamar was not his wife! Ah! that is clear enough&mdash;although
the narrative of the murder would imply
otherwise. But the only inference that can be drawn
from this discrepancy, is that the reporter of the assassination
was delicately and judiciously sparing of
the feelings of the Medina family&mdash;whereas, in the
former case, it was absolutely necessary to record the
evidence just as it was given. Poor Tamar!&mdash;no
wonder that thy name is never mentioned now by
those who once knew thee&mdash;no wonder that even thy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
very sister, the Countess of Ellingham, seems to have
forgotten thee!”</p>

<p>Thus, Charles Hatfield suddenly adopted the belief
that Tamar was not Rainford’s wife. Neither, indeed,
was she at the time when Rainford was arrested by
Mr. Dykes; and it never struck the young man that
the matrimonial ceremony might have been performed
between the period of Rainford’s resuscitation and the
murder of the Jewish lady. For when the nuptial
blessing <em>was</em> performed in Paris, Charles&mdash;being then
a mere boy&mdash;was not present at the proceedings which
took place as privately as possible in the British Ambassador’s
Chapel. As for his suspicion that the
Countess of Ellingham was ashamed to breathe the
name of Tamar,&mdash;Oh! the reader may judge how erroneous
was that belief! In her heart of hearts did
the generous Esther treasure the image of that dearly-beloved
sister;&mdash;and if neither herself nor her noble
husband ever breathed her name, it was through kind
feelings towards Mr. Hatfield and motives of delicacy
in respect to Georgiana. But Charles, being as yet
ignorant that his father and Rainford were one and
the same person, could not possibly suspect the necessity
for the exercise of such kind feelings on the one
hand or such delicacy on the other.</p>

<p>“And thus,” murmured Charles to himself, as he
closed the book which had made such marvellous
and horrifying revelations,&mdash;“and thus Thomas Rainford
was a highwayman! The good&mdash;kind-hearted&mdash;generous
man who loved me, was a felon&mdash;a
criminal: he passed through the hands of the public
executioner! Oh! my God&mdash;what dreadful things
have I this night learnt!” he exclaimed aloud, pressing
his hand to his forehead. “But how came
this Thomas Rainford to have the care of me?&mdash;how
was it that my parents could have left me
so long in his hands&mdash;or at his disposal? Oh! no
wonder&mdash;no wonder that Mr. de Medina and Esther
should have charged me, when first they left me at
school, never to mention the name of Rainford! And
now how many gaps in the earliest portion of my reminiscences
are filled up,&mdash;that absence of Mr. Rainford
for several weeks, during which period I pined after
him&mdash;that constant weeping of Tamar&mdash;then the removal
to Mr. de Medina’s house, and the sudden revival
of joy which Tamar experienced there. But&mdash;a
highwayman&mdash;a felon&mdash;a criminal! Oh! what awful
mysteries envelop all this matter still! For the Earl
of Ellingham was intimate with Rainford&mdash;and it
was said, I remember, that at Mr. de Medina’s death
he left to this same Rainford a large fortune. A fortune
to whom?&mdash;to the seducer of his daughter&mdash;to
one who had passed through the hands of the public
executioner! And Lord Ellingham was intimate
with the man who seduced the sister of his intended
wife;&mdash;and Esther was friendly likewise with him
who ruined that sister. Gracious God! all this is
most unaccountable&mdash;so unaccountable, that I am
lost and bewildered! But most mysterious&mdash;ten
thousand times the most mysterious of all these incidents,
is that one grand fact to which I cannot but
recur,&mdash;how could my parents have left me in the
care of a highwayman! ’Tis true that he received
the royal pardon: but that pardon&mdash;&mdash;Ah! the
<em>Register</em> says that it was procured through the interest
of Lady Hatfield&mdash;that Dykes, an officer of justice,
was present at the time when that lady announced&mdash;&mdash;Just
heavens! a light breaks in upon my
soul&mdash;&mdash;Oh! no&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;and yet that resemblance&mdash;&mdash;May
God have mercy upon me!”</p>

<p>And the young man, groaning bitterly&mdash;bitterly, in
the anguish of his spirit, fell back in his chair&mdash;covering
his face with his hands.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;a light had indeed broken in upon him, elucidating
a terrible mystery in a terrible manner! Lady
Georgiana Hatfield had procured the royal pardon:&mdash;Lady
Georgiana Hatfield must therefore have had
strong reasons thus to exert herself in behalf of a
convicted felon, who had passed through the hands of
the hangman, but had been recalled to life and restored
to the world in some wondrous manner. But
of what nature were those potent reasons? Naturally
did it strike Charles Hatfield that <em>love</em> must have been
the cause;&mdash;and when he recollected the resemblance
which existed between his own father and that
Thomas Rainford who had once been his friend and
protector, it flashed to his mind that he in whom
Lady Hatfield had shown such tender interest&mdash;even
to the compromising of her fair fame in the eyes of
the world,&mdash;he for whom she had so far stepped
aside from the precise course of female delicacy as to
implore the royal pardon,&mdash;he it must be who was
her husband!</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;yes: it was now as clear as the sun at noon-day:&mdash;Mr.
Hatfield and Thomas Rainford were one
and the same individual,&mdash;and he&mdash;Charles Hatfield&mdash;was
the son of a highwayman who had been tried&mdash;convicted&mdash;and
ushered through all the ignominious
ordeal of the scaffold!</p>

<p>For several minutes the young man sat motionless&mdash;crushed,
stupefied, astounded by the appalling truth
which he had elicited from his fatal investigations
into the past:&mdash;for several minutes it must have been
a mere balancing of chances whether he should
awake from that dreadful reverie to the light of
reason once more, or suddenly start up a howling,
hopeless maniac!</p>

<p>But this latter condition was not to be his frightful
doom. By degrees&mdash;by very slow degrees, he recovered
so much of his self-possession and composure
as to be enabled to look his misfortune in the
face, and even fall into additional reflections on the
subject.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;Thomas Rainford and Mr. Hatfield are the
same individual&mdash;and <em>he</em> is my father! It was but
little more than nineteen years ago when the trial and
the ordeal of the gallows took place&mdash;and I am twenty-five!
Was my mother&mdash;was Lady Hatfield my father’s
<em>wife</em> at that time? In other words&mdash;am I legitimate?
‘<em>As God is my judge</em>,’ said my father yesterday, ‘<em>she
has never been guilty of weakness or frailty</em>.’ Then
what am I to believe? That my father and my
mother were married privately in an honourable manner&mdash;and
that I was the offspring of that lawful union;&mdash;then,
that my father deserted my mother, and
became enamoured of Tamar, whom he took as his
mistress;&mdash;and, lastly, that after Tamar’s death, my
parents were reunited! This&mdash;this must be the truth&mdash;and
therefore my father deceived me not when he
so emphatically proclaimed my mother’s virtue and
my legitimacy. But&mdash;Oh! my God!&mdash;well might
he have said that <em>the weightiest reasons had alone
induced him and my mother to practise a deception
towards myself and the world in respect to the degree
of relationship in which I really stood with regard to
them</em>! Yes&mdash;for the world perhaps dates the marriage
of my parents only from the time when they were
reunited a few years after Tamar’s death:&mdash;and hence
the necessity of calling me their <em>nephew</em>! I understand
it all now&mdash;Oh! yes, I understand it all too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
well! I am legitimate&mdash;but I am the son of a highwayman:
my God! how bitterly&mdash;bitterly is my
curiosity punished this night!”</p>

<p>And now the young man sobbed as if his heart
would break.</p>

<p>Whither had flown his dreams of ambition?&mdash;where
now were his hopes of emulating the career of His
Royal Highness, the Prince of Montoni?</p>

<p>“The son of a highwayman!”&mdash;these were the
words that fell ten times in a minute from his tongue:&mdash;that
was the idea which now sate, dominant and
all-absorbing, but like a leaden weight, upon his soul.</p>

<p>And did he loathe his father?&mdash;did he curse the
author of his being?</p>

<p>No&mdash;no: a thousand times, <em>no</em>! Deep&mdash;profound&mdash;immeasurable
was the pity which he entertained for
his sire;&mdash;and if he loathed any thing, it was his own
existence&mdash;if he cursed aught, it was his own being!</p>

<p>For, oh! terrible indeed was it for that fine young
man, of lofty principles, generous nature, and soaring
aspirations,&mdash;terrible was it for <em>him</em> to receive a blow
so sudden&mdash;a shock so rude&mdash;a rebuff so awful!</p>

<p>Better&mdash;better far had it been for him to remain in
ignorance of his parentage,&mdash;still to have looked on
Mr. Hatfield as his uncle, and on Lady Georgiana as
his aunt,&mdash;rather than have learnt a secret which
only prompted him to fathom collateral mysteries and
clear up associated doubts! For the result of those
researches was the elucidation which had flashed on
him with almost lightning effect,&mdash;blasting&mdash;searing
scorching!</p>

<p>“Accursed book!” he suddenly exclaimed, hurling
the <cite>Annual Register</cite> across the apartment, as if the
volume were a living thing, and endowed with human
feelings, so as to be susceptible of the venting influence
of his rage.</p>

<p>But in the next moment he reflected that no trace
of an untimely or mysterious visit to that library
must remain,&mdash;that none must suspect his pryings
or his researches: for not for worlds&mdash;no, not for
worlds&mdash;would he have his father or mother know
that he had made the discoveries which characterised
this memorable night! He accordingly rose from his
seat&mdash;raised the volume from the floor&mdash;and turned to
the book-case to replace it.</p>

<p>This act, so simple in itself, was destined to lead to
a circumstance thenceforth influencing the entire destiny
of Charles Hatfield: for as he thrust the volume
back into the place on the shelf whence he had taken
it, he heard a sharp abrupt sound, like the click of a
lock.</p>

<p>He was in that humour when every incident, however
trivial, was calculated to assume an importance
in his imagination; and, standing on a chair, he proceeded
to examine the wainscotting at the back of the
shelves&mdash;for which purpose he removed several of the
books. To his surprise, he observed a small aperture
formed by the opening of a sliding panel, and which
revealed a recess in the wall of about a foot square,&mdash;the
violence with which, in his excitement, he had
thrust the book on the shelf, having acted on the secret
spring whereby the panel was fastened.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, Charles Hatfield
would have immediately closed the recess, in which
he beheld a small leathern case and a packet of letters,&mdash;in
the same way as he would have abstained from
reading a manuscript lying on a desk or evidently left
about through inadvertence. But, on the present
occasion, he was not his own master:&mdash;his honourable
feelings were triumphed over by emotions of the most
painful nature;&mdash;and it was impossible, in this state of
mind, that he should avoid catching at any circumstance
savouring of mystery,&mdash;every such circumstance
apparently linking itself with his own concerns.</p>

<p>Thus, obedient to an impulse which he could not
controul, he seized the leathern case and the documents
as if they were a glorious prize; and, returning
to his seat, proceeded to examine them.</p>

<p>The leathern case contained a roll of letters, and
other documents <em>tied round with a piece of riband
so faded that it was impossible to determine what
its colour might have originally been</em>. The writing in
the papers was, however, still completely legible&mdash;the
leathern case, and the total absence of damp in the
little recess, having preserved them for a period of
half a century!</p>

<p>Wrapped round the roll of papers in the case, was
a letter, addressed to the Earl of Ellingham; and it
instantaneously struck Charles that it was in the handwriting
of his father&mdash;Mr. Hatfield! By the comparative
darkness of the ink, it was of a far more recent
period than the documents which it accompanied;&mdash;but
the precise time when it was written did not immediately
appear, no date being attached to it.</p>

<p>Without pausing to reflect upon the impropriety of
violating the sanctity of correspondence concealed with
so much precaution in a secret recess,&mdash;but carried
away by the influence of those feelings which we have
above attempted to describe,&mdash;Charles Hatfield devoured
the contents of this letter; and though they
are already familiar to the reader, yet for the purposes
of our narrative we quote them again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have sent you the papers, my dear brother&mdash;for so I
shall make bold to call you still,&mdash;to convince you that I
did not forge an idle tale when we met last. Whatever your
motive for abandoning me in my last hour may be, I entertain
no ill feeling towards you: on the contrary, I hope that
God may prosper you, and give you long life to enjoy that
title and fortune which in so short a time will be beyond the
possibility of dispute.</p>

<p>“I had promised to leave behind me a written narrative
of my chequered and eventful history for your perusal:
but&mdash;need I explain wherefore I have not fulfilled this promise?</p>

<p class="author">
“T. R.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>“His brother&mdash;his dear brother!” gasped Charles
Hatfield, as the letter dropped from his hands; but his
eyes remained intently fixed upon it: “his brother!”
he repeated. “My God! then am I the nephew of the
Earl of Ellingham?&mdash;am I the cousin of Lady Frances,
whom I already love so well? But&mdash;&mdash;gracious
heavens!” he ejaculated, as another and still more
thrilling idea flashed to his mind: “if Mr. Hatfield be
indeed the brother of the Earl of Ellingham&mdash;as he
assuredly is,&mdash;then is he the elder brother! And if the
elder brother, he himself should be the bearer of the
title&mdash;and I&mdash;I should be a Viscount! But&mdash;ah!
perhaps my father is the illegitimate offspring of the
late Earl&mdash;and that this is the reason wherefore the
family honours and estates have devolved upon the
younger brother! And yet&mdash;what mean these words?&mdash;‘<em>give
you long life to enjoy that title and fortune
which in so short a time will be beyond the possibility
of dispute</em>!’ Oh! here again is some dreadful mystery:
just heavens! what a fated&mdash;doomed family is
ours! Doubt&mdash;uncertainty&mdash;secrecy characterise all its
history:&mdash;at least the experience of the last two days
would lead me so to believe!”</p>

<p>At this moment the young man’s eyes fell upon the
roll of paper which he had taken from the leathern
case: and with feverish impatience&mdash;yet still with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
care, inasmuch as the documents were as fragile with
old age as tinder&mdash;he proceeded to examine them.</p>

<p>And, oh! how deep&mdash;how intense suddenly became
the interest with which he now perused the diary and
the letters of the unfortunate Octavia Manners! His
excitement was stilled&mdash;his impatience was subdued:
a deadly pallor succeeded the hectic flush upon his
cheeks;&mdash;still and motionless sate he, his eyes devouring
the contents of those important papers!</p>

<p>The frightful treachery of Old Death towards his
half-sister, the beautiful but ill-fated Octavia, was revealed
step by step;&mdash;but there was likewise an elucidation
which touched a chord that thrilled to the
inmost recesses of young Hatfield’s heart,&mdash;and this
was the fact that Octavia was wedded by the late
Earl of Ellingham previous to the birth of the child!
Yes&mdash;there was the marriage-certificate: there, too,
was the certificate of the child’s baptism;&mdash;and that
child was therefore, at its very birth, the heir to the
proud title and the entailed estates of a mighty Earldom!</p>

<p>Here let us pause for a few moments to afford an
explanation which now becomes necessary.</p>

<p>If the reader will refer to the forty-seventh chapter
of this narrative, he will find recorded so much of the
history of poor Octavia Manners as Arthur himself
was acquainted with. In relating that history to Lady
Georgiana Hatfield, Arthur had stated that Octavia
fled away from her vile half-brother’s house the very
day after her disgrace was consummated. “For several
months no trace was discovered of her: it was
feared she had committed suicide.” During that interval
the first Countess of Ellingham died. At length
the Earl (Arthur’s father) accidentally discovered that
Octavia was living, and that she was in a way to
become a mother. “He hastened to the miserable
garret which she occupied, and found her in the most
abject state of poverty&mdash;endeavouring to earn a subsistence
with her needle.” All his affection for her revived,
with renewed vigour; and his heart smote him with
remorse for the appalling treachery which he had perpetrated
towards her. He saw her ruined in health,
character, and spirits,&mdash;ruined by him,&mdash;still surpassingly
beautiful, but only a wreck of what she once
was;&mdash;he saw all this&mdash;and he was horror-struck at
the effects of his crime! He threw himself on his
knees&mdash;he offered her every possible reparation which
it was in his power to make;&mdash;and then&mdash;for the sake
of the child which she bore in her bosom&mdash;she said,
“If you would prove your contrition, my lord&mdash;if you
would impart one single gleam of hope, however faint,
to my goal&mdash;you will make me your wife! It is not
for myself that I demand this boon at your hands,&mdash;for
a boon it becomes when the violater espouses the
violated,&mdash;yes, a boon in the estimation of the world,
though only an act of justice in the eyes of God! No&mdash;it
is not for myself; ’tis for our child! Think not
that I&mdash;the sister of the marine-store dealer&mdash;shall
ever assume the name or adopt the rank of Countess
of Ellingham! Let our union be secret&mdash;only let it
take place at once, so that our child may be legitimate!”
Thus spoke Octavia Manners on that occasion;
and the Earl of Ellingham, her violater, consented
to all that she asked. They were married with
so much privacy that even Miranda&mdash;the faithful
gipsy girl who had formed so strong an attachment to
Octavia&mdash;remained ignorant of the important occurrence.
But the very next day Octavia fled! No
affection had she for the noble who had ruined her&mdash;who
had been the cause of her severance from the
object of her first and only love: she had only asked
him to marry her for the sake of the honour of their
child’s parentage&mdash;and, the ceremony being performed,
she withdrew herself into the strictest solitude
and obscurity, to brood over her woes and sufferings
in secret!</p>

<p>Such was the substance of that portion of Octavia’s
own diary which revealed to Charles Hatfield the fact
that the injured girl was indeed the Countess of Ellingham
when her child was born! And that child’s
career could be traced&mdash;yes, satisfactorily traced&mdash;step
by step, by means of the papers which the young
man had taken from the leathern case, and the packet
of letters that he had likewise found in the recess;&mdash;and
it was evident, beyond the least possibility of
doubt, that the individual whom the world had known
as Thomas Rainford, and whom it now knew as Mr.
Hatfield,&mdash;it was clear, even beyond the remotest
ground of suspicion to the contrary, that this individual
was the rightful Earl of Ellingham!</p>

<p>Recollect, too, reader, that Charles Hatfield had become
firmly impressed with the belief that he was the
<em>legitimate</em> offspring of his parents;&mdash;and now, therefore,
conceive the wild enthusiasm of his delight, when
he came to the conclusion that he was in reality a
Viscount by present rank, and had an Earldom in the
perspective!</p>

<p>Forgotten was the fact that had ere now stunned
and stupefied him,&mdash;the fact that his father was the
notorious highwayman, Thomas Rainford:&mdash;he thought
of that no more, in the delirium of his rapture at the
idea of having a noble title within his reach. But had
he not, on the previous day, assured Lady Frances
Ellingham that he envied only the greatness which
had made itself, and not that which was obtained by
the accident of birth? Yes: and at the time he conscientiously
believed that he spoke his own thoughts
correctly. Now, however, that the temptation appeared
to be within his reach, it possessed charms and
attractions of irresistible power!</p>

<p>Recalling to mind the sounding titles of the object
of his admiration and heroic worship, he began to
fancy that <em>the Right Honourable the Earl of Ellingham</em>
was not comparatively so very insignificant, even
when uttered after the swelling appellations of <em>His
Royal Highness Field Marshal the Prince of Montoni,
Captain-General of the Castelcicalan Army,
and Heir-apparent to the Grand Ducal Throne</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as it were, we behold the young man,
whose sentiments were so noble and generous while he
deemed himself to be a mere civilian having every
exertion to make in order to rise to eminence,&mdash;suddenly
we behold him seized with an insatiable ambition,
now that a coronet appeared to be actually within
his reach.</p>

<p>But did he contemplate the immediate adoption of
measures to force his father to wrest the title and estates
of the Earldom from Arthur? We know not all
that passed through the mind of Charles Hatfield on
this fatal night:&mdash;we can, however, aver that having
fully perused the valuable documents which had made
to him such important revelations, he did not restore
them to the secret recess where he had found them,
but secured them about his own person.</p>

<p>Previously to quitting the library, he closed the
sliding panel, and replaced the <cite>Annual Register</cite> in
such a manner that the shelf did not appear to have
been disturbed.</p>

<p>The west-end clocks were striking three, and the
light of a July morning was streaming through the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
windows of the mansion, when Charles Hatfield retired
to his own chamber. His first care was to consign to
his writing-desk the documents and letters which he
now considered to be the arbiters of his destiny; and,
this being performed, he sought his couch.</p>

<p>But slumber would not visit his eyes:&mdash;myriads of
conflicting ideas were in his brain. He felt that he
had to play the hypocrite&mdash;to keep a bridle on his
tongue&mdash;to control every look, and measure every
word, until the time should come for proclaiming all
he knew. For the present he would not distress his
parents by allowing them even to suspect that the
things which they considered to be such profound secrets,
were no longer so to him. No:&mdash;he would endeavour
to appear the same gay&mdash;frank&mdash;confiding&mdash;affectionate
Charles Hatfield that he hitherto had
been!</p>

<p>These were amongst the principal reflections which
chased sleep from his pillow until long past four
o’clock;&mdash;and when at length his heavy lids were
weighed down through sheer exhaustion of the mental
and physical energies, his slumber was agitated with
wild and varying visions, and he awoke unrefreshed,
and still suffering with the fatigue of his long vigil.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXVII">CHAPTER CXXVII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE WANDERERS.</span></h2>

<p>The night on which Charles Hatfield made the important
discoveries detailed in the preceding chapter,
was marked by other events of a scarcely less interesting
nature.</p>

<p>It was about eleven o’clock&mdash;the weather was intensely
warm&mdash;and not a breath of air agitated the
foliage on the way-side, as two females toiled slowly
and painfully along the high road between Dartford
and Shooter’s Hill.</p>

<p>One was a hideous old harridan whose years could
not have been less than sixty-two or sixty-three; and
yet, though her form&mdash;once tall, symmetrical, and on
a large scale&mdash;was bowed with age and sufferings, she
still possessed considerable physical energy. The
countenance was weather-beaten and tanned to such
an extreme that, had she been dressed in male attire,
no delicacy nor feminine cast of features would have
betrayed her real sex: her short grizzled locks were
confined by an old kerchief wound round her head in
a gipsy fashion;&mdash;and her garb denoted the utmost
penury and distress. Not only did she leave upon the
mind the disagreeable impression of revolting ugliness;&mdash;but
her look was sinister and repulsive. The
wrinkles beneath her eyes and about her closely compressed
lips, bespoke a ferocious and determined character,&mdash;a
soul resolute and nerved to every evil purpose;&mdash;and
the acute observer might also mark in
that countenance traces of those stormy and impetuous
passions which had influenced her earlier years.</p>

<p>Her companion was a young woman of about
nineteen; and though she was dressed almost as
wretchedly as the old harridan, yet how different was
the form which those rags covered! For her figure,
though full even to a maturity beyond her years, was
exquisitely modelled,&mdash;a waist not ridiculously small,
but still small enough to develop in all their voluptuous
proportions the swelling hips and fine bust. Clothed
in stockings covered with darns, and shod with
large clumsy shoes, were limbs and feet that for
symmetry might have been envied by a queen;&mdash;and,
as if anxious in the depths of her penury to
preserve her charms as completely as possible, she
wore an old pair of gloves upon her beautifully
sculptured hands. Then her face, though sun-burnt
was of a beauty which event an anchorite must have
turned to admire,&mdash;yet a beauty of a bold and masculine
style, and stamping her rather as a very handsome
than as a very lovely woman. Her features were of
the Roman cast,&mdash;the strong facial aquiline denoting
a voluptuous and profoundly sensual disposition;&mdash;her
fine large grey eyes looked boldly and wantonly from
beneath dark brows majestically arched and almost
meeting between the temples, and above which rose
the high, straight, wide forehead, crowned with intelligence.
Her hair was of a dark brown and singularly
luxuriant, glossy, and silken;&mdash;and it was
evident that not even the bitter miseries of poverty
rendered her indifferent to the care which that glorious
covering required to maintain its splendour unimpaired.
Her mouth was small,&mdash;the upper lip thin&mdash;the lower
one fuller, but not pouting;&mdash;her teeth, the least thing
large, were nevertheless perfectly regular and of pearly
whiteness;&mdash;and her chin was prominent, but well
rounded. The general expression of her countenance
was indicative of strong passions and fierce desires&mdash;great
resolution of purpose&mdash;and something approaching
even to a resolute sternness of purpose, amounting
almost to implacability. She was not above the middle
height; and her carriage was more commanding
than graceful:&mdash;at the same time, it would have
struck a beholder that were she attired in a befitting
manner, her gait and gestures would have been characterised
by nothing positively inelegant.</p>

<p>The reader will perceive that great, in many respects,
was the contrast between the mother and
daughter&mdash;for in such close relationship did the two
females stand to each other: but in some points there
was a marked resemblance. For instance, the countenances
of both indicated strong passions and indomitable
resolution;&mdash;both were totally devoid of all moral
principle, though they could simulate the sanctity of
anchorites to suit their purposes or serve their interests;&mdash;and
both could be implacable enemies, while friendship
was a mere name with them at which their lips
would curl into a sneer.</p>

<p>In spite of her natural energies and the somewhat
substantial remains of physical strength, the old woman
dragged herself slowly and painfully along the road
towards London; while her daughter exhibited scarcely
less evident symptoms of fatigue&mdash;approaching almost
to total exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Perdita,” said the harridan, suddenly breaking a
silence that had been of long duration,&mdash;“Perdita,”
she repeated, “we cannot reach London this night: it
will be impossible,&mdash;I feel it will be impossible.”</p>

<p>“Then we must lie down by the road-side and
perish with hunger,” answered the young woman, who
bore, it seemed, the singular Christian name of <em>Perdita</em>.</p>

<p>We have above spoken of contrasts and resemblances
in respect to these two females, who are destined to
play no unimportant part in the forthcoming chapters
of our narrative;&mdash;but we must pause to observe that
it would be impossible to conceive a greater discrepancy
in tones than that which marked the voices of
mother and daughter.</p>

<p>The voice of the old woman was masculine&mdash;hoarse&mdash;disagreeable&mdash;and
grating to the ear; and although
she spoke the English language with the most grammatical
punctuality, and there was nothing positively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
vulgar in her manner of speech, yet the impression it
seemed calculated to produce upon a stranger was
singularly unpleasant. On the other hand, the whole
sphere of harmony has known nothing more melodious
than the voice of Perdita,&mdash;a voice which was capable
of many modulations, each characterised by a charm
peculiar to itself; for whether she were speaking in
indignation&mdash;or in softness,&mdash;in outbursting passion&mdash;or
in dogged ill-humour,&mdash;still were the tones of that
voice metallic, rich, and flowing.</p>

<p>“The heartless wretches!” exclaimed the old
woman, again breaking an interval of silence,&mdash;“to
thrust us on shore at Deal with only a shilling in our
pockets!”</p>

<p>“This is not the least hardship we have ever endured,
mother,” said Perdita, rather in a tone of
remonstrance than consolation. “For my part, I have
scarcely ever seen any thing but privation and
misery&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You ungrateful wretch!” ejaculated the harridan,
furiously. “When I had but a morsel of bread to give
you, did I ever take a portion for myself! For you, Perdita,”
she continued, speaking in a milder and even
more tender tone,&mdash;“for you I have gone through
sufferings unknown and unheard of in this country,&mdash;for
you have I toiled beneath the scorching South
Australian sun of summer, and amidst the noisome
damps of a South Australian winter! Yes&mdash;for years
and years have I toiled on&mdash;toiled on, that your beauty
might not be impaired by want or privation,&mdash;at least
that you might endure as little want and privation as
possible.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well,” cried the young woman, somewhat
softened by her mother’s words; “don’t let us look
back to the past. We are now in England&mdash;and you
say that we are not many miles from London. Good!
We will endeavour to sustain each other’s courage and
strength to reach the fine city where you hope to
change our rags into silks and satins, and fill our empty
pockets with gold.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and you shall see whether I have deceived
you, Perdita!” exclaimed the harridan, in a tone partaking
of enthusiasm. “Nearly nineteen years have
elapsed since I last saw the mighty metropolis; and,
unless its people be much changed, there is a fortune
to be made by an experienced woman and a beautiful
girl, leagued together.”</p>

<p>“And you are the experienced woman, mother?”
said Perdita, actually seeking a compliment&mdash;for inordinate
vanity was amongst her failings.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and you are the beautiful girl&mdash;and you
know it,” returned the old harridan. “Being of accord
as we are together, it is impossible that we can fail to
accomplish our grand designs. Why was it that I implored
you not to accept the offers of marriage which
needy settlers made you in New South Wales? Because
your charms can command thousands of pounds
in London; whereas, in that frightful colony, all you
could have hoped to gain was what is termed ‘<em>a comfortable
position</em>.’ And to one possessing your notions&mdash;your
pride&mdash;your strong passions&mdash;your soaring disposition,&mdash;aye,
and to one endowed with your loveliness
too,&mdash;a mere <em>home</em> is not sufficient. You require
luxuries&mdash;although you have never yet tasted them,&mdash;fine
clothes&mdash;although you have never yet worn them,&mdash;a
splendid equipage, although you have never yet
known the use of one! It was for this that I brought
you to England,&mdash;it was for this that I besought you
to contract no marriage in the colony,&mdash;it was for this
that I conjured you to abstain from any connexion
that might become permanent!”</p>

<p>“I am well aware of your motives, mother,” said
Perdita. “In a word,” she added, with a strange
mixture of pride and irony, “you considered my
beauty to be more marketable in London than in
New South Wales. And after all that you have told
me of the English people and England’s capital, I am
inclined to believe that you have not misled me. But
supposing that I contract some splendid marriage in
London&mdash;that I find my way into the highest circles&mdash;and
that I become the <em>belle</em> of the great city,&mdash;will
there not be the constant risk&mdash;the ever imminent
chance of falling in with the officers of some of those
regiments which have returned from Sydney or Botany
Bay&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I see now that you scarcely understand me&mdash;that
we do not altogether comprehend each other!” interrupted
the old woman, impatiently. “There is no
need for you to count only on the chance of making a
good match: ’tis indeed far more probable that you
may ensnare some young gentleman of birth, family,
and fortune,&mdash;or some old voluptuary of immense
wealth,&mdash;and there is more to be gained as the mistress
of one of these, than as a wife. Do not marry,
Perdita&mdash;do not dream of marriage: remain independent&mdash;and
the moment you have ruined one lover,
you can take another. There&mdash;that is plain speaking;
and now do you comprehend me?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” answered the young woman: then,
under the influence of the wanton thoughts which
rushed to her imagination, she said, “Yes&mdash;I comprehend
you, and I confess that your views now become
more suitable to mine. I could not chain myself to
one individual, with any hope of being faithful to
him:&mdash;<em>love</em> is a passion which will never obtain over
me that influence which it so often exercises over the
weak, the simple-minded, or the infatuated.”</p>

<p>“Be not too confident on that point, Perdita,” said
the old woman. “In Sydney and Botany Bay your
amours were only the result of a warm temperament;&mdash;for
carefully as I watched over you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, mother, let us have no moral teachings from
your lips!” exclaimed the young woman, in an imperious
and authoritative tone; “for had you been so
very immaculate yourself, I should never have beheld
the light of day, neither would you have passed some
eighteen or nineteen years of your life in a penal
colony. And such a colony as it is! Why&mdash;let a
pretty girl be hemmed in by all the precautions which
a parent can imagine, circumstances must inevitably
lead her astray in South Australia! And you,&mdash;<em>you</em>,
who know all this so well,&mdash;can you wonder if I were
seduced at the early age of thirteen, and if from that
period until your pardon arrived and we embarked to
return home, I have not failed to indulge my fancy
without hesitation? On the one side I obeyed your
instructions,&mdash;I accepted no offer of marriage, and
lived with no man permanently as his mistress: but,
on the other, I hesitated not to intrigue with the
gayest and most dashing officers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough! enough!” ejaculated the mother, who,
bad as she herself was, felt a cold chill come over her
at this open, audacious, and unblushing avowal of her
daughter’s depravity,&mdash;a depravity that was not however
unknown, either in circumstances or extent, to
the old woman. “Give me your arm, Perdita&mdash;assist
me to mount this hill,&mdash;for I am ready to drop. There!
you are a good girl! Ah! Perdita&mdash;I was once young
and beautiful as you are now,&mdash;well-formed too, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
elegant in carriage! I was a lady in every sense of
the word&mdash;as far as outward appearance and manners
went. But now&mdash;oh! how altered I am! My toothless
mouth was once filled with pearls as white as
yours&mdash;my bust was as voluptuous and as firm&mdash;my
figure was as upright&mdash;my feet and ankles as delicate&mdash;and
my step as light! Ah! that was many&mdash;many
years ago, Perdita!”</p>

<div id="i_065" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Shall you not be glad, mother, to visit London
again?” demanded the young woman.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;for ’tis the only city in the world where
adventuresses like ourselves&mdash;beggars, I may say&mdash;are
certain to succeed. Oh! you have no idea of what a
pandemonium is the great metropolis of England!”
exclaimed the harridan, with strange emphasis. “’Tis
a furnace in which millions of passions, interests, and
ideas are ever boiling&mdash;boiling madly and as if in
rage: ’tis a scene of immense iniquity and of boundless
luxury&mdash;of wondrous intrigues and ineffable enjoyments.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how I long to plunge headlong into that fine
city!” cried Perdita. “It is a vortex that will suit
my disposition well.”</p>

<p>“Aye&mdash;and play your cards as I shall prompt,” observed
her mother; “and you will speedily be the
mistress of all the pleasures which London can afford.
But, oh! I am ready to drop with weariness&mdash;I am
dying with hunger and thirst, Perdita: and not a
penny have we to purchase a morsel of bread&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I see a strong light yonder&mdash;there, mother&mdash;in
that bye-lane,” said the young woman. “Shall we
repair in that direction&mdash;perhaps it may be a hospitable
cottage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No: ’tis a gipsy’s encampment&mdash;I can distinguish
the cart and the tent,” interrupted the old wretch.
“But the gipsy race are good and generous; and they
will not refuse us a morsel of bread and a cup of
water.”</p>

<p>The two wanderers accordingly proceeded towards
the strong light which Perdita had first discovered,
and which proved to be, as her mother had surmised,
the fire of a gipsy encampment situate in a bye-lane.
As they approached, they observed a female form
crouching over the blazing faggots, in spite of the
intense sultriness of the weather, and apparently
watching with attention a huge cauldron that was
suspended above the fire in the usual gipsy fashion.
When Perdita and her mother drew nearer still, they
obtained a more perfect view of that female, whose
countenance was thrown out in strong relief by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
lurid flame; and they now perceived that she was a
very old woman, bent down with the weight of years,
but having nothing in her appearance of that weird-like
character which so generally marks gipsy women
of advanced age. She seemed to be all alone in the
encampment at the time;&mdash;and her attitude, which
had at first struck the wanderers as being that of a
person watching the culinary process, now assumed a
more thoughtful and serious character.</p>

<p>“Good dame,” said Perdita, “we are sinking with
fatigue and famishing through want; and we crave
your hospitality.”</p>

<p>“Ah! a woman as old as myself doubtless?” exclaimed
the gipsy-crone, surveying Perdita’s mother
with attention. “Come&mdash;sit down&mdash;you are welcome&mdash;you
are welcome! I am all by myself for the present:
my people have gone to a short distance&mdash;on
business of their own&mdash;but <em>that</em> is of no matter to you.
Young woman,” she continued, addressing herself to
Perdita, “you are strong and active: I was once so
myself! Ascend into the cart&mdash;you will find wooden
bowls and spoons&mdash;and help yourselves to the contents
of the pot. There will be enough for my people when
they come back.”</p>

<p>The old gipsy spoke in so strange&mdash;vague&mdash;and
peculiar a manner that the wanderers were both impressed
with the idea that she must be in her dotage;
and the rapid look of intelligence which passed between
mother and daughter, showed that they had simultaneously
entertained the same idea. Perdita, however,
hastened to obey the directions which she had
received; and, returning with the utensils, she and her
mother commenced a hearty meal upon the broth and
soddened poultry and meat which the cauldron contained.</p>

<p>While the two wanderers were thus employed, the
old gipsy began rocking herself to and fro, and uttering
her thoughts aloud. First she addressed herself to
her guests: then, by degrees forgetting their presence,
and becoming more and more enshrouded in the mists
of her own failing mind, she still continued her musings
in an audible tone.</p>

<p>“An old woman and a young one&mdash;eh?&mdash;then you
are doubtless mother and daughter? Ah! I wish that
I had a daughter so comely to look upon as yourself,
my pretty dear;&mdash;but I should not like her to be quite
so bold in her demeanour as yourself. You are very
lovely: and yet methinks you are scarcely as virtuous
as you are beautiful. Oh! now the red blood mantles
in your cheeks: but do not take offence. ’Twere a
sorry deed on my part to offer insult to those who
share my hospitality. Yes&mdash;I wish that I had a
daughter, who would love me in my old age. My own
people neglect me: they leave me alone&mdash;alone&mdash;for
many long hours together;&mdash;and then I have no other
companions but my own thoughts. And strange companions
are they at times, I can assure you. Let me
see&mdash;what was I thinking of when you came up? Oh!
I remember now:&mdash;yes&mdash;I remember now. Fifty
years ago&mdash;no&mdash;it was about forty-nine, I nursed a
male child,&mdash;the child of Octavia Manners and the
Earl of Ellingham. I do not mean this present Earl:&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;’twas
the late Earl. The child had a
peculiar mark on the right arm: ’twas near the
shoulder. Then I was turned away by the dead
Octavia’s half-brother, Benjamin Bones&mdash;a horrible
man, who knew no pity. But the child again fell in
my way&mdash;Egyptia had it in keeping. Ah! I loved
that child&mdash;I would have adopted it as my own. For
seven years did I retain the boy with me&mdash;the dear
boy, whom methinks I see now. But, the wretches&mdash;they
sent him away: they lost him in Winchester&mdash;cast
him off purposely on the wide world. Oh! how
I regretted that dear, flaxen-headed boy! They told
me he was dead&mdash;and I mourned for him. Years
and years passed away: heaven only knows how many&mdash;I
cannot stop to count them now. But it must have
been twenty or twenty-one years ago that I met the
flaxen-haired boy. Boy! no&mdash;no&mdash;he was a man&mdash;a
fine, dashing, jovial, rollicking man;&mdash;yes&mdash;and, woe
is me&mdash;a highway robber!”</p>

<p>By this time the two wanderers, who had not lost a
single word of all that the gipsy crone was thus uttering
aloud in her musings, became interested in the
wild, yet still connected history which she was relating,&mdash;a
history that was revealed by the development of
her own thoughts and reminiscences, and which she
seemed to experience a “pleasing pain” in reciting.
But it was the elder of the two listeners&mdash;Perdita’s
mother&mdash;who paid the deepest and most particular
attention to the crone’s audible meditations, and who
seemed to experience a presentiment that they were
furnishing a subject which might be turned to her own
and her daughter’s advantage.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” continued the old gipsy, “we met in
Hampshire&mdash;and circumstances revealed him to me.
The mark on the arm then proved that it was indeed
he! I told him the history of his birth&mdash;and he expressed
his intention to visit London and seek to
recover from Old Death&mdash;that was the villain Benjamin
Bones&mdash;the money of which he had been plundered.
Alas! poor Tom Rain&mdash;you went to the great city to
meet your doom! You were captured&mdash;you were
tried&mdash;you were cast for death&mdash;and you were hanged
on the roof of Horsemonger Lane gaol. Yes&mdash;I saw
it all with my own eyes: for I was amidst the crowd&mdash;drawn
thither by God alone can tell what strange
infatuation! And if in the deep anguish that rent
my heart, there was a single gleam of joy&mdash;a single
gleam, however faint&mdash;’twas to mark how boldly you
died, my brave Tom Rain! Died&mdash;died!” exclaimed
the old gipsy, now speaking with thrilling emphasis:
“no&mdash;no&mdash;you did not die! Methought, however, as
did the rest of the multitude, that you were indeed no
more: and for years&mdash;for many years&mdash;for nineteen
years have I held that same belief. And during that
interval, oft&mdash;oft have I thought of thee,&mdash;thought of
thee as once I knew thee, Tom Rain&mdash;a flaxen-headed
boy, and before thou didst bear that name of Rainford!
Yes&mdash;I have thought of thee&mdash;aye, and wept bitterly,
bitterly. But&mdash;am I dreaming&mdash;am I becoming crazy?&mdash;or
is it indeed true that ten days ago, when in
London, I saw thee&mdash;yes, thee&mdash;alive and in the full
enjoyment of health and wealth? Ah! I recollect&mdash;’twas
not a dream: no&mdash;no&mdash;I saw thee,&mdash;and I recognised
thee, too, disguised though thou wert. For
not even the hair dyed black&mdash;nor the change effected
by time&mdash;nor the plain and unassuming garb,&mdash;no&mdash;naught
could deceive me, Tom Rain, in respect to you!
I beheld you in a carriage, with your half-brother the
Earl of Ellingham, and with a fine young man whose
countenance was of glorious beauty.”</p>

<p>These words suddenly made Perdita as attentive
and interested a listener as her mother, both having
by this time finished their hearty meal.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;a young man divinely handsome,” continued
the gipsy-crone, rocking herself to and fro; “with a
countenance that would ensnare any young female
heart! And I made enquiries&mdash;and I learnt that my
Tom Rain was now Mr. Hatfield, and that this young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
man was his nephew. Oh! I know it was Tom Rain:
but how came he thus alive?&mdash;by what means was he
resuscitated?&mdash;who snatched him from the grave? No&mdash;no&mdash;I
am not a drivelling fool&mdash;a dreaming idiot,
as my people said: I know full well that it was he&mdash;I
could not be mistaken;&mdash;and yet, ’tis impossible to
say how he was snatched from death! He is married,
too&mdash;married to Lady Georgiana Hatfield, whose name
he has taken. And they are now all dwelling together
at the mansion of the Earl of Ellingham in Pall Mall.
I longed to go thither and tell Tom Rain&mdash;no, Mr.
Hatfield, I mean&mdash;that I had recognised him,&mdash;tell
him that in me he beheld the Miranda whom he once
knew: but my people laughed at me&mdash;they told me
that I was in my dotage&mdash;that I was dreaming,&mdash;I,
who have intellects as keen as ever&mdash;and sight so sharp
that I knew my dearly-beloved Tom Rain in spite of
his dyed hair and his changed aspect! Then my people
forced me away with them;&mdash;but they cannot prevent
me from thinking of Tom Rain as much and as often
as I choose!”</p>

<p>The gipsy-crone ceased; and now she seemed to
become suddenly aware again that she was not alone.
But not reflecting that she had been speaking aloud
the whole time, and that her two guests had overheard
every syllable she had uttered, she turned towards
them, making some remark of a perfectly indifferent
character. It was easy to perceive that the poor old
creature was half demented, in spite of her self-gratulation
on the keenness of her intellects: but Perdita’s
mother was sharp and far-seeing enough to know that
many important truths were evidently commingled
with the gipsy’s rhapsodical reminiscences.</p>

<p>“You have journeyed far to-day?” said Miranda&mdash;for
such indeed was the crone’s name.</p>

<p>“Many miles,” replied Perdita’s mother: “but now
that we are refreshed through your kindness, we shall
push more speedily on to London.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you are taking that pretty child of yours to
the great city, which we gipsies abhor and never visit
unless on urgent occasions,” observed Miranda. “What
is your name, young woman?”</p>

<p>“Perdita,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Perdita!” repeated the gipsy. “That is a strange
name. We have singular names amongst our race:
but I never before heard so remarkable a one as that
which <em>you</em> bear. What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“Have names any meaning at all?” demanded
Perdita’s mother, in a tone of impatience. “But,
come, daughter&mdash;let us thank this good woman, and
be off!”</p>

<p>The gipsy was however again rocking herself to and
fro before the fire, and seemed to have relapsed into
her profound reverie, save that this time she did not
give audible utterance to her musings. She was however
so much absorbed in thought that she did not
hear the thanks that were tendered by the wanderers,
nor mark their departure.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXVIII">CHAPTER CXXVIII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE JOURNEY CONTINUED AND CONCLUDED.</span></h2>

<p>Perdita and her mother exchanged not a word until
they reached the high road once more; but when their
faces were again turned towards London, the latter
exclaimed in a tone of chuckling triumph, “’Twas a
lucky chance which threw us in with that gipsy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother&mdash;as far as obtaining a good meal was
concerned,” replied Perdita.</p>

<p>“Silly child! it was the old crone’s talk that elicited
the remark which I just made. Did you not hear the
strange facts she suffered to ooze out in her idiotic
musings? Did nothing strike you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes: her description of a young man of such divine
beauty made so strong an impression upon me, that
my very veins appeared to run with lightning,” interrupted
Perdita.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried her mother, evidently struck by a
sudden thought: “you were pleased with her allusion
to that handsome young gentleman? Well, Perdita&mdash;trust
me when I declare emphatically that this same
young gentleman shall sue at your feet for those favours
which unasked you would this moment bestow
upon him!”</p>

<p>“Mother, you yourself will soon appear to me to be
indulging in idiotic musings!” cried Perdita, half in
delight&mdash;half in contemptuous incredulity. “You
never saw this young man&mdash;you know nothing of
him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Know nothing of him!” repeated her mother,
scornfully. “We know enough, Perdita, to compel a
whole family to implore our forbearance and our
mercy,&mdash;to reduce that Mr. Hatfield, Lady Georgiana,
and their nephew to the necessity of beseeching our
silence on their bended knees!”</p>

<p>“Do you really put faith in the rhodomontade of
that gipsy about the identity of the Mr. Hatfield of
whom she spoke with a certain Tom Rain who had
been hanged?” demanded Perdita, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;because I know it to be true!” ejaculated
her mother. “Listen, Perdita:&mdash;you were not born
at that time&mdash;but it was only a few months before
your birth when the whole metropolis was astounded
by the sudden discovery that Tom Rain, the highwayman,
was indeed alive. I was in London at the
time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In Newgate, mother?” asked her daughter, as
coolly as if it were the most common-place question.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;in Newgate, if you must have me be particular
in every detail,” answered the old harridan, bitterly.</p>

<p>“Where I was born,” remarked Perdita. “One of
the first places I shall request you to show me, will be
that same Newgate. But go on&mdash;I am listening
attentively.”</p>

<p>“Well, then&mdash;I was in Newgate at the time that all
London was astounded by certain discoveries relative
to this same Tom Rainford&mdash;all brought about in consequence
of a dreadful murder committed by that very
Benjamin Bones whom you heard the gipsy mention.
The story is too long to tell you now; but you shall
have it shortly in its fullest details&mdash;for it may regard
our interests more nearly than you at present imagine.
One fact I must however state,&mdash;which is that Thomas
Rainford was a famous highwayman who was hanged,
and that by some means which never transpired, he
was rescued from death&mdash;resuscitated, in fine. He
received the royal pardon for all the deeds he had
committed in opposition to the laws; and what afterwards
became of him I knew not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Because you had to leave England in pursuance
of your sentence, I suppose, mother?” added Perdita,
enquiringly.</p>

<p>“Precisely so. And now chance throws us in the
way of an old crone who, in the audible musings of
dotage, informs us that this same Tom Rain is actually
living under a feigned name&mdash;aye, and at the mansion
of the Earl of Ellingham. It is clear that the gipsy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
had never heard of the wondrous fact that Rainford
appeared in London disguised as a Blackamoor, only
a few months after his execution, as I may call it: it
is evident that the circumstance of his having survived
the scaffold was unknown to her and to her
companions. Thus was she struck with amazement
and surprise, as well she might be under such circumstances,
when she beheld him in Lord Ellingham’s
carriage. But gipsies go so little into great cities
and towns&mdash;hold so little intercourse with any save
their own people&mdash;and are so little curious in respect
to matters which do not immediately concern themselves,
that it is not surprising if the old gipsy had
never heard reported the well-known fact of Rainford’s
resuscitation.”</p>

<p>“Then you presume that this Rainford is now living,
honourably and respectably, in London, under the name
of Hatfield,” said Perdita, enquiringly; “and you mean
to use your knowledge of his real name to work out
our particular aims?”</p>

<p>“You now comprehend me, daughter,” returned the
old woman; “and you may perhaps begin to understand
how his nephew shall become bound to you by
silken cords.”</p>

<p>“I have set my mind upon that handsome young
man,” said Perdita, emphatically; “and believe me,
I shall omit nothing that will tend to gratify my
passion.”</p>

<p>“Wanton&mdash;voluptuous, even as I was,” muttered
the harridan to herself;&mdash;“aye, licentious and depraved
as was her father!”</p>

<p>“What are you mumbling to yourself, mother?”
demanded Perdita. “Something about me, I warrant.”</p>

<p>“No harm&mdash;no harm,” responded the wretch, hastily.
“But, to return to the subject of our conversation,
Perdita; what do you think of our prospects now?&mdash;knowing
all we do of this Mr. Hatfield, and able as
we are to overwhelm him, his titled wife, and his
nephew in disgrace, if we choose to utter a single
word.”</p>

<p>“I think that all will go well enough in respect to
money; for <em>that</em> we have the means of extorting,” said
Perdita. “But I cannot see how, by such a course,
we shall do otherwise than disgust the nephew, and
make an enemy of him.”</p>

<p>“Ah! short-sighted girl” ejaculated her mother.
“We must not commence with extortion! I know
that Lady Georgiana Hatfield was very rich when I
was a resident in London years ago; and it is not probable
that she has become poor since. Then again,
this Hatfield or Rainford must be on intimate terms
with the Earl of Ellingham, since he and his family are
residing at that nobleman’s mansion. All this denotes
that the young man can command ample funds at
will;&mdash;and the young man, then, must be ensnared by
your wiles. But if you surrender yourself to him
immediately&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Trust me for knowing how to play my cards well!”
interrupted Perdita, impatiently. “But on our arrival
in London to-night, where are we to find a dwelling-place?&mdash;how
are we to clothe ourselves decently to-morrow?&mdash;how,
in a word, are we to live until all these
grand schemes begin to work?”</p>

<p>“You shall see, Perdita,” answered her mother.
“During my long sojourn in Australia, one person in
England wrote to me frequently&mdash;one person sent me
sums of money occasionally. Otherwise, Perdita, after
I obtained my ticket of leave, we should have starved:
for the labour of my hands, severely as I toiled, produced
not sufficient to maintain us both. This one
person lives in London: I know his address;&mdash;and to
his door must we first repair before we can even procure
the wherewith to obtain a bed!”</p>

<p>“Is it the friend who, as you told me, interested himself
to procure your pardon?” demanded Perdita.</p>

<p>“The friend!&mdash;the relation you mean,” said her
mother, hastily. “Yes&mdash;he is my relation&mdash;the only
one I possess in the world save yourself, if a daughter
can be called by that name.”</p>

<p>The conversation, which may have served to throw
additional light upon the depraved character of these
two women, was interrupted by the necessity of stepping
to the side of the road to permit a cart, which was
on the point of overtaking them, to pass. The vehicle
was driven along at a rapid pace by a sturdy, good-natured
butcher; and as it was whisking by the two
females, the pure moon-light falling fully on the handsome
countenance of Perdita, enabled the man to catch
a glimpse of the surpassing beauty of that face.</p>

<p>Instantly pulling up, he said, “Holloa! my good
women, you are out late&mdash;or rather early&mdash;for ’tis two
o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>“We are very tired, and are anxious to reach London
as soon as possible,” replied Perdita’s mother.</p>

<p>“I am going as one may say right through London,”
observed the butcher: “in fact, to Oxford Street&mdash;and
if you like to have a ride, both of you, I’ll put you
down at the nearest point to where your business leads
you.”</p>

<p>The old woman greedily snapped at the offer; and
the good-natured butcher helped her daughter and
herself into the cart, which immediately drove on again
at a spanking pace.</p>

<p>And now full soon did the myriad lights of London
greet the eyes of the travellers; and Perdita felt her
heart dilate with ineffable emotions as she drew near
that sovereign city of a thousand towers, pinnacles,
and spires,&mdash;that mighty Babylon in which all her
hopes, her aims, her ambitious views were centred. A
misty haze of light, resembling a faintly illuminated
fog, appeared to hang over the vast metropolis;&mdash;and
as the vehicle approached nearer and nearer still, the
countless dwellings began to stand out in relief from
the bosom of that dimly lustrous shroud. On&mdash;on the
travellers go: the houses are scattered along the road;&mdash;but
in a short time they become continuous ranges
of habitations;&mdash;and now it may be airily said that
the wheels of the cart rattle on the pavement of
London.</p>

<p>But a feeling of disappointment seizes upon Perdita:
instead of lordly mansions, she sees dingy-looking
tenements of no considerable size, and presenting any
thing but an imposing appearance, especially at that
sombre hour. Nevertheless, the farther she advances
the more satisfied does she become;&mdash;and now the
travellers reach that great junction-point for cross-roads,
where stands the Elephant and Castle.</p>

<p>The tap is open&mdash;the butcher stops, alights, and disappears
inside the establishment. In a few minutes
he returns with a steaming hot glass of brandy-and-water,&mdash;for
a good-natured fellow is this butcher;&mdash;and
he kindly proffers it to the two females. It was
not because Perdita was so handsome, that he did it:
no&mdash;it was through pure kindness, and as much for
the sake of her mother as of herself. Nor did the
two females require much pressing to partake of the
welcome beverage; and while they were drinking
<em>their</em> glass, their good-hearted friend hurried back to
the tap to enjoy <em>his own</em> reeking jorum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>And now away they speed again&mdash;up the Waterloo
Road&mdash;over the bridge. Then and there it was that a
splendid and soul-stirring spectacle burst upon the
sight of Perdita:&mdash;for an instant her admiration was
rivetted to that magnificent piece of masonry constituting
the finest viaduct of the kind in the whole
world;&mdash;but in the next she threw her glances right
and left, embracing thus rapidly all the splendid features
of a scene bathed in silver by the cloudless lamp
of night. The bosom of the mighty Thames reflected
the lights on the banks and the bridges,&mdash;those very
lights tracing the course of the proud stream and
marking its ample width:&mdash;then her looks dwelt on
the mighty dome of Saint Paul’s, rearing its colossal
head to the deep purple summer sky;&mdash;and lastly they
ran rapidly along the northern shore, embracing each
point of interest, until they stopped at the New Houses
of Parliament, so gleamingly white in the chaste lustre
of the moon.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” she whispered, in an exulting tone:
“this is indeed a stupendous city!”</p>

<p>“You have seen nothing of it as yet,” was the
reply. “But here we must alight,” added the old
woman, the moment the cart reached the Strand.</p>

<p>The wanderers accordingly descended; and, having
proffered their hearty thanks to the butcher for his
kindness, they continued their journey on foot, their
way now lying in the direction of Brompton.</p>

<p>Along the Strand they proceeded&mdash;through Spring
Gardens&mdash;into St. James’s Park,&mdash;Perdita admiring
the fine buildings which she passed; for the morning
was now breaking, and each grand feature of that part
of the metropolis emerged slowly and majestically
from obscurity.</p>

<p>Perdita’s mother, in pointing out Carlton House to
her daughter, observed, “When I was last in England
George the Fourth was King; and that was his
favourite residence.”</p>

<p>They proceeded through the park;&mdash;and now Perdita
beheld the abode of the Queen of England&mdash;that palace
on which so much of the country’s money has been
shamefully squandered, and with the arrangements of
which her Majesty is still dissatisfied! God help
Victoria, if she cannot contrive to make herself comfortable
at Buckingham House; we sincerely hope that
she will always find such quarters gratuitously provided
for her, and that she will learn not to grumble
at them. Contrast that palace with the working-man’s
home, and then let us see whether Parliament
would be justified in voting another sixpence to enlarge
or improve the sovereign residence. Oh! how
loathsome&mdash;how revolting to our mind are the caprices,
the selfishness, and the insolence of Royalty!</p>

<p>The two wanderers now entered the spacious district
of Pimlico, which they traversed painfully&mdash;for they
had become almost as wearied as when they were toiling
on between Dartford and Shooter’s Hill.</p>

<p>“Shall we soon be there, mother?” enquired Perdita,
her handsome countenance bearing a care-worn
expression as if patience and strength were alike
nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>“In less than twenty minutes now,” was the answer,
“we shall reach the place whither we are bound.”</p>

<p>“And suppose your nephew should not be in London?”
said Perdita.</p>

<p>“Ah! now you have touched the very chord which
vibrates with anguish to my heart’s core!” exclaimed
the old woman. “But let us not yield to despondency,”
she added, almost immediately.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it is useless to meet evils half way,” observed
Perdita.</p>

<p>The two proceeded in silence for upwards of a quarter
of an hour, until they reached a particular part of
Brompton, when the elder wanderer said, “It must be
somewhere about here that he lives. Ah! Number
Seven! Yes&mdash;<em>this</em> is the house, Perdita!” she added,
indicating a beautiful cottage-residence, standing alone
in the midst of a pleasant garden. “But it will be
useless for you to accompany me,” continued the hag:
“on the contrary, many reasons, which I will hereafter
explain, render it advisable that my nephew should
not come to know you by sight.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please, mother,” said Perdita, in the
quiet way which was habitual to her when she had no
inclination either on one side or the other. “There
is a large stone at the angle of the road yonder: I will
rest there until you return.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” replied the old woman; and, having paused
for a few moments to dwell admiringly on the fine
symmetry of her daughter’s form as Perdita repaired
slowly towards the point indicated, the harridan advanced
to the door of the house in which her relation
dwelt.</p>

<p>She knocked and rang;&mdash;and in a few minutes a
servant-maid, throwing open a window, enquired who
it was that came at such an unseasonable hour.</p>

<p>“Is your master at home?” demanded the old
woman.</p>

<p>“He is: but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” ejaculated the visitor, considerably
relieved by this announcement. “You must inform
him that an elderly female wishes to speak to him on
particular business&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I cannot venture to disturb him,” answered the
servant. “Come at eight o’clock: master and missus
will be up then.”</p>

<p>At this moment another window was opened, and a
gentleman, who had evidently slipped on a dressing-gown
in great haste, appeared at the casement, exclaiming,
“I will see you now&mdash;at once!”</p>

<p>And in less than a minute the old woman was admitted
into the dwelling by the gentleman who had
thus addressed her.</p>

<p>Not a word was uttered,&mdash;merely hasty glances of
recognition were exchanged, and those looks dubious on
her part and reserved on his,&mdash;until they entered a
parlour, the door of which the gentleman carefully
closed, while his visitress sank exhausted upon a
sofa.</p>

<p>“I am returned at last, Clarence,” she said, in a low
and hoarse voice,&mdash;for she was now evidently much
moved at finding herself in the presence of her relative,
and by no means so confident as she had appeared
to her daughter with regard to the reception
she was likely to experience.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;returned, against my express desire&mdash;against
the solemn promise that you sent me to remain in the
colony if I procured your pardon!” exclaimed Mr.
Villiers&mdash;for it was he&mdash;in a reproachful tone.</p>

<p>“Would you have had me bury myself in that
horrible place of exile?” demanded his aunt&mdash;Mrs.
Torrens, or Mrs. Slingsby, or whatever she now denominated
herself.</p>

<p>“I would have had you keep your pledge so sacredly
given,” replied Clarence; “and on my side I should
have fulfilled my engagement by remitting you forty
pounds every half-year. Why&mdash;why have you come
back to England?”</p>

<p>“Because I would sooner die than remain in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
colony where I have endured so much,” responded the
woman.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you have endured much indeed,” said Mr
Villiers, still more bitterly than before: “but it has
been your own fault. Do you remember the interviews
I had with you in prison both prior and subsequent
to your condemnation? Did you not exhibit
every sign of the deepest contrition&mdash;utter every possible
vow of amendment? And what were the results?
Arrived in the colony, you became unruly&mdash;profligate&mdash;a
perfect scandal where all is scandalous&mdash;shameless
where every thing is shameful&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Clarence!” exclaimed his aunt, rising
from the sofa and advancing towards him: “it is
so easy to reproach&mdash;but not so easy to admit of extenuation
for guilt. As God is my judge, my penitence
in Newgate was sincere&mdash;my contrition unfeigned!
I even longed for the hour of my departure
to arrive, that I might for ever quit a country where
I had played so vile a part, and to some extent retrieve
my character in a penal colony. But when I set foot
on board the convict-ship, I found myself thrown into
the depths of a very sink of immorality,&mdash;plunged into
an infernal stew of profligacy, from which escape was
impossible. I threw myself on my knees before the
surgeon, and implored him to remove me from that
dreadful assemblage of fiends in female shape: he
laughed at me, and bade me return to my place. Then
my companions abused and ill-treated me for having
dared to complain;&mdash;and the babe which I bore in
my arms was made the subject of the bitterest taunts
and most cutting gibes. I had named her <em>Perdita</em>&mdash;as
you well know&mdash;that her lost and hopeless condition,
through the infamy of her mother, might ever be
retained fresh in my memory, and that the necessity
of toiling hard and honourably for her might be impressed
on my soul even by the warning nature of
that very name. But, oh! those wretches, with whom
I was forced to associate, levelled the most cruel jeers
and jests against me on account of that innocent babe;
because she was born in Newgate! And nothing is so
galling&mdash;nothing so terribly afflicting&mdash;nothing so
poignantly cutting, as to insult a woman through the
medium of her illegitimate, helpless babe! My God!
what bitter tears I shed on board that convict-ship,&mdash;tears
which seemed to sear my very countenance as
they fell, so scalding were they! Then the frightful
scenes which were enacted in our cabin,&mdash;the quarrelling
that took place, the imprecations that accompanied
even the simplest remark, the obscene tales
that were told,&mdash;oh! it was horrible, horrible. I
struggled against the contamination as mortal being
never struggled before:&mdash;but it was like a combat
between a drowning person and the fury of a whelming
torrent,&mdash;a vain, ineffectual, and useless fight, in
which I felt myself to be completely powerless;&mdash;until,
in despair, I resigned myself to the flood that
was whirling me along in its triumphant course;&mdash;and
I found relief even in drinking of that feculent, fœtid
stream from which there was no escape. Yes&mdash;thus
was I drawn down into the whirlpool of immoralities
and profligacies on the brink of which the law placed
me:&mdash;and if my vows of contrition&mdash;my asseverations
of penitence proved so many delusions, you must
blame the system to which I was subjected&mdash;and not
myself.”</p>

<p>“And do you mean, then, to inform me that you
endeavoured to be moral, reserved, pious, and tranquil
on board the convict-ship&mdash;but that it was impossible
to avoid being dragged into the common abyss of depravity?”
demanded Clarence, now speaking in a mild
and even compassionate tone.</p>

<p>“Most solemnly do I swear that such is the fact!”
exclaimed his aunt, with an emphasis which spoke
volumes in favour of her sincerity.</p>

<p>“Then are you to be pitied, poor woman,” said
Clarence; “and the Government of that day most
bear all the blame of your relapse and subsequent depravity.
But where is your daughter Perdita?”</p>

<p>“She is in the neighbourhood&mdash;waiting for me,”
was the answer. “I did not choose to bring her beneath
your roof. Indeed, naught save necessity&mdash;necessity
the most stern&mdash;should have led me hither.”</p>

<p>“The accounts which I received from a correspondent
at Sydney, spoke, alas! most unfavourably of
your daughter,” observed Clarence. “My God! could
you not at least have saved her from entering the
paths that lead to perdition?”</p>

<p>“Behold, now, how ready you are to blame me!”
cried his aunt, in a voice expressive of vexation. “I
was allotted as a servant to a free-settler in the penal
colony; and the man made me his mistress. There
was no compliance on my part in the first instance:
’twas absolute compulsion. Then I yielded to my
fate, seeing that it was useless to contend against it.
I had to work hard all day; and the moment Perdita
was able to run alone, she played in the streets with
the other poor children of Sydney. I could not prevent
it&mdash;do all I would to endeavour to keep her in
doors.   Well, at last I obtained a ticket of leave, and
tried to earn a livelihood by the toil of my own hands.
But to do this, I was compelled to be out all day;&mdash;and
then, where was Perdita? Where was she?”
almost screamed the woman, becoming much excited:
“why&mdash;<em>lost</em>&mdash;as her name implies;&mdash;not lost as you
lose an object and can find it no more,&mdash;but lost
<em>morally</em>&mdash;irretrievably lost! ’Tis true that I imparted
to her as much knowledge as I myself possessed
or had leisure to instil into her&mdash;and that to do
this I deprived myself of my natural rest. But how
could I teach her virtue?&mdash;how could I read the Bible
with her? My story was known throughout the
colony;&mdash;and Perdita learnt before even she had intelligence
to understand the meaning of the facts, that
she was a bastard&mdash;born in Newgate, the great criminal
prison of London&mdash;and that her mother was every
thing infamous and vile! My God! circumstances
would not allow me to nurture her in moral ways,
even if I had possessed the inclination: but by the
time she was old enough to learn, I had myself become
as deeply steeped in profligacy as any other woman in
the colony. Can you wonder, then, that she soon fell
into the ways of vice? Beautiful as she was&mdash;and is&mdash;she
soon attracted notice;&mdash;and your fine English
officers&mdash;the gentlemen sent out to protect the colony,&mdash;<em>they</em>
were the authors of her ruin&mdash;and they encouraged
her in a career of infamy. Oh! Clarence, it
is a frightful thing for me to stand before you&mdash;you,
who are my own nephew&mdash;and have to make such
horrible revelations: but you reproach me for my own
wickedness&mdash;you would seek to represent me as the
cause of my daughter’s wickedness&mdash;and I am forced
to explain to you the appalling nature of the influences
acting upon us, and the circumstances surrounding us.
Now&mdash;now, I could weep in humiliation;&mdash;but an hour
hence, I shall be obdurate and hardened as ever. The
world has made me so.”</p>

<p>“And now what do you propose to do?” enquired
Clarence. “It is impossible for me even to advise you
in the frightful position in which you are placed, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
since you have acted so completely in opposition to
my counsel by returning to England. Pecuniary
assistance&mdash;<em>that</em> I can afford you to a limited
amount&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Give me fifty guineas, Clarence&mdash;and you shall
never see me more,” interrupted his aunt.</p>

<p>“I will spare you a hundred,” answered the generous-hearted
young man; and quitting the room, he
returned in a few minutes, bringing the money in a
bag. “Here,” he said,&mdash;“take that, my poor aunt&mdash;and
may God make it prosper in your hands. But,
oh! suffer not your daughter to continue in the ways
of vice and depravity: remember that she possesses
an immortal soul&mdash;and that there is another world in
which an account must be given for the conduct pursued
in this.”</p>

<p>The old woman made no answer; but, clutching the
bag eagerly, she secured it amongst her tattered garments.
Then, ashamed of the greedy impatience which
she had manifested, and seeking to avert her nephew’s
attention from the fact by turning the conversation
into another channel, she said, “I hope you continue
to enjoy that happiness, Clarence, which yourself and
your excellent Adelais so much deserve!”</p>

<p>“Thank God! my felicity is as complete as man’s
can be in this world,” was the reply. “Having now
for upwards of nineteen years held the good situation
which my kind patron, the Earl of Ellingham, gave
me, I have enjoyed a certain means of existence&mdash;have
acquired influential friends&mdash;and have been enabled to
rear my sons and daughters in a way which, I hope,
will be salutary to them on their entrance into life.”</p>

<p>“And that man&mdash;my husband&mdash;have you heard of
him lately?” enquired Villiers’ aunt, in a low tone
and hesitating way.</p>

<p>“Never since the occasion&mdash;and that is now nine
years ago&mdash;when he wrote to announce the death of
poor Rosamond at Geneva. I mentioned that fact
to you in a letter which accompanied one of the remittances
I made to Sydney on your behalf&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And from that time you have received no tidings
of my husband?”</p>

<p>“Not once!” replied Villiers. “Whether he be
alive or dead&mdash;what has become of him, I cannot tell
you. This uncertainty relative to her father’s fate is a
cause of uneasiness to Adelais:&mdash;but every state and
station in life has its annoyances and its sorrows.
Poor Rosamond! she fell into a slow decline shortly
after leaving England&mdash;and for nearly ten years did
she linger on, wasting away! Adelais and I saw her
once during that period: we visited Switzerland on
purpose. Then how deeply was my wife shocked when
she behold the wreck that remained of her once lovely
and blooming sister. But I cannot dwell upon that
episode in our lives&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” exclaimed Perdita’s mother, now in haste
to depart. “I will not distress you,” she added, with a
hypocritical appearance of sympathy, “by exacting
the painful narrative from you. Farewell, Clarence&mdash;farewell.”</p>

<p>The generous-hearted Villiers proffered his hand to
his aunt,&mdash;that aunt who was once so fine a woman,
so elegantly dressed, and the mistress of a splendid
mansion,&mdash;but who was now hideous to look upon,
clothed in rags, and as yet homeless on the face of the
earth!</p>

<p>For a few instants her heart swelled with profound
emotions as she pressed that hand which was thus
kindly extended to her, and tears rose to the very
brims of her eyes, but did not run over.</p>

<p>Then she hurried away from his presence:&mdash;and the
moment she set foot on the threshold of the dwelling&mdash;or
rather, when its door closed behind her&mdash;she subdued
the feelings that had well nigh overpowered her;
and gave all her attention&mdash;all her interest&mdash;all her
thoughts to the precious bag which she had concealed
amongst her garments.</p>

<p>“Well, mother, I thought you were never coming
back!” cried Perdita, in a reproachful tone: then, perceiving
by the old woman’s countenance that she had
good news, she allowed her own to brighten up, as she
hurried to meet her.</p>

<p>“Perdita&mdash;we have now the means&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of obtaining shelter and a breakfast, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Of purchasing good clothes&mdash;taking fine lodgings&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! then your nephew&mdash;or relation of some kind,
whatever he may be&mdash;has behaved well!” cried the
young woman, overjoyed by this intelligence.</p>

<p>“A hundred guineas, Perdita&mdash;a hundred guineas
in this bag!” exclaimed her mother, shaking the precious
object of her avaricious worship: then, again
concealing it beneath her rags, she said, “But come,
Perdita: let us betake ourselves to another quarter of
the town&mdash;for I have promised Clarence Villiers that
he shall see my face no more.”</p>

<p>The old hag and the handsome young woman retraced
their way into the heart of London; and, arriving
in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden, they entered
an early breakfast-house, where they partook of a
copious meal, to which appetite and good spirits enabled
them to do honour.</p>

<p>The repast being despatched, the elder of the two
wanderers had a few minutes’ whispering conversation
with the landlady of the establishment; the result of
which was that a bed-room was speedily placed at the
disposal of the guests, who retired to partake of a few
hours’ most necessary repose.</p>

<p>It was near mid-day when the mother and daughter
rose; and then another interview with the landlady
was shortly followed, in obedience to the instructions
given her, by the arrival of a woman who sold second-hand
female apparel, and who came laden with band-boxes.
The contents thereof were speedily examined;
and the wanderers having selected the articles which
seemed most appropriate for their temporary use, the
slop-seller was well paid and dismissed.</p>

<p>And now Perdita and her parent began to assume
each a very different appearance from that which they
had so recently worn. Copious ablutions and decent
clothing made the elder less revoltingly ugly, and the
younger more strikingly beautiful.</p>

<p>As they thus performed their toilette together, in
the little chamber of the coffee-house, the mother surveyed,
with pride and admiration, the features and
form of her daughter,&mdash;calculating at the same time
how large a fortune the judicious sale of such loveliness
was likely to amass;&mdash;while on her side the young
woman stood in superb complacency before the glass,
exercising a thousand little arts to render the details of
her toilette as perfect as circumstances would admit.</p>

<p>Perdita’s dark brown hair was combed out with the
utmost care, and arranged in simple bands, glossy and
massive on either side of her fine forehead. By chance
she had obtained from the second-hand dealer a gown
which precisely fitted her, and which, being very low
in the body, displayed her full and swelling bust to its
greatest advantage. The darned stockings and the
clumsy shoes wore superseded by more fitting articles;
and now the robust leg, the slender ancle, and the long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
narrow foot were as faultless in proportion as if a
sculptor had modelled them to his own exquisite but
voluptuous taste. A neat straw bonnet and an ample
shawl completed her attire;&mdash;and now well, but by no
means splendidly nor elegantly dressed, Perdita appeared
a creature so exceedingly handsome, that even
her mother was surprised as much as she was delighted.</p>

<p>And, as for the old woman herself, she had assumed
an air of greater respectability than at first might
have appeared possible&mdash;seeing that her look was
sinister and repulsive, and her countenance so weather-beaten
and marred by suffering!</p>

<p>Forth went the mother and daughter into the
streets of London;&mdash;and their first care was to purchase
a variety of articles of attire of a far better
kind than that which they had just procured,&mdash;likewise
a little jewellery and the necessary <em>paraphernalia</em> of
the toilette. The goods were all sent to the coffee-house
where they had hired a chamber; and a couple
of large trunks were the last objects they bought, and
which were despatched to the same place.</p>

<p>These matters having been accomplished, the old
woman conducted her daughter into the fashionable
quarter of Regent Street; and there Perdita beheld
enough to excite her wonder and her admiration. The
magnificent shops&mdash;the fine buildings&mdash;the splendid
equipages&mdash;and the handsomely dressed gentlemen on
horseback, all shared her attention in their turns:&mdash;nor
was she, an observer, unobserved&mdash;for many an old
voluptuary and stripling gallant paused to bestow a
second glance upon the plainly but decently dressed
young female whoso countenance was so strikingly
beautiful, and in whose looks there was a subdued
wantonness engendering the most voluptuous sensations.</p>

<p>To Perdita’s mother how altered did London seem!
Here was a street which she had never seen before&mdash;there
a street had been pulled down to make way for
some great thoroughfare. Here buildings once familiar
had disappeared: there strange edifices had sprung up!
In Regent Street she looked for the shops at which
she had been accustomed to deal long years before,
when she dwelt in the immediate neighbourhood, and
when she was deemed a <em>saint</em>: but most of the establishments
she sought had changed their proprietors
and their nature,&mdash;a grocer’s having become a book-seller’s,
a milliner’s a china warehouse, and so on. She
had a great mind to pass into Burlington Street; but
she had not quite the necessary courage to do <em>that</em>&mdash;at
least for the present.</p>

<p>Having threaded Regent Street from Oxford Circus
to Waterloo Place, the two women turned into Pall
Mall West, along which they proceeded for a short
distance; when the mother suddenly clasped her
daughter’s arm almost violently, exclaiming in a hasty
whisper at the same time, “This is the mansion of the
Earl of Ellingham!”</p>

<p>Scarcely were these words uttered, when the door
was opened, and forth came Charles Hatfield. Passing
by the two females without noticing that he had immediately
become the object of their most earnest
attention,&mdash;and indeed, without observing them at all,
so deeply was he absorbed in thought,&mdash;he moved on
at a slow and uncertain pace, as if he had merely come
out to seek the fresh air, and having no particular
destination.</p>

<p>Yes:&mdash;he had indeed become the cynosure of
attraction on the part of the old woman and her
daughter,&mdash;the former devouring him with her eyes,
in order to read his character and disposition in his
countenance, and assure herself from that physiognomical
perusal that he was fitted for her purpose,&mdash;and
the latter embracing with a look of ardent, wanton
scrutiny every feature of his fine face and every proportion
of his symmetrical form.</p>

<p>He passed on:&mdash;and for a few minutes the mother
and daughter preserved a deep silence, each occupied
with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>“That young man may be rendered pliant and docile
according to our will,” said the old woman at length.</p>

<p>“He is beyond all doubt the one whom the gipsy
alluded to in such glowing colours,” observed Perdita,
with a voluptuous languor in the eyes, a flushing of
the cheeks, and a slow but deep heaving of the bosom.</p>

<p>“And he has something on his mind&mdash;that is clear!”
added the old woman.</p>

<p>“Which we will soon make him divulge to us,” said
Perdita. “But how do you intend to proceed in order
to form his acquaintance?”</p>

<p>“Oh! nothing is more easy!” returned her mother.
“In the first place we must take handsome lodgings.
I know of a nice, quiet, retired street in the neighbourhood.
Come along, Perdita&mdash;we must not waste valuable
time.”</p>

<p>The two women repaired direct to Suffolk Street,
Pall Mall East; and in the window of a house of handsome
appearance they saw a card announcing furnished
apartments to be let. The lodgings were
speedily inspected and hired, the prepayment of a
month’s rent immediately ensuring the good opinion
of the landlady and rendering references unnecessary.</p>

<p>Back to the coffee-house in the vicinity of Covent
Garden did the wanderers hasten; and in a few
minutes all their packages and new purchases were
transported to a hackney coach, which was fetched
from the nearest stand. The coffee-house keeper was
liberally rewarded, and a handsome fee was bestowed
upon the driver of the vehicle to induce him to state,
in case of being questioned in Suffolk Street, that he
had brought the ladies from some respectable hotel.</p>

<p>All these matters being arranged, the mother and
daughter proceeded in the hackney-coach to their
new lodgings, where they at once took up their quarters
under the imposing name of Mrs. and Miss Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>Had the worthy butcher who a few hours previously
took pity on the two ragged, sinking mendicants, and
sustained their strength and courage by means of hot
brandy-and-water at the Elephant and Castle,&mdash;had
he now beheld Mrs. and Miss Fitzhardinge sitting
down, elegantly attired, at a well spread dinner-table,
and at the fashionable time of six in the evening,&mdash;he
would not for an instant have supposed that the
way-worn beggars of the morning’s adventure and the
ladies of Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, were identical: or
if, by chance, he should have recognised Perdita’s
handsome countenance, he would have thought that
the delusions of enchantment had been practised upon
him or her.</p>

<p>And now we have prepared the way, with due prefatory
explanation, for one of the most striking and
remarkable episodes in this narrative&mdash;an episode
showing how Perdita’s arts and Perdita’s beauty accomplished
aims which women of less enterprise than
herself and her mother would have deemed impossible.</p>

<p>Oh! fatal influence&mdash;that influence which the depraved
and wanton Perdita wielded by means of her
transcendant charms!

<span class="medium">THE ADVERTISING AGENT.</span></h2>

<p>On the day after the one the incidents of which have
just been related, Mr. Bubbleton Styles called, precisely
as the clock struck eleven in the forenoon, upon
an advertising agent dwelling in the immediate vicinity
of Cornhill.</p>

<p>The agent, knowing that Mr. Styles was the registered
promoter of a scheme which had obtained the
patronage of the high and mighty Mr. Podgson, was
particularly civil and urbane; and having bowed him
into the private office, and presented him with a chair,
he said, “Now, Mr. Styles, sir&mdash;what can I do for
you?”</p>

<p>“I intend to give the newspapers a round of advertisements,”
answered the City gentleman, pulling out
his prospectuses.</p>

<p>“Softly&mdash;softly, my dear sir,” exclaimed the agent:
“you must be guided by me in this. If you went to
the generality of agents, they would say, ‘<em>Oh! advertise
by all means in every paper in existence</em>:’&mdash;but I,
Mr. Styles, am a little more conscientious. There are
some journals, in fact, which are perfectly useless as
advertising media: it would be money completely
thrown away.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you for your kindness,” said
Mr. Styles. “Of course we shall advertise in the
<cite>Times</cite>.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of course!” cried the agent. “’Tis
the great daily Leviathan which every body sees, no
matter what his politics may be. The <cite>Morning
Chronicle</cite>, too, is a good medium: the <cite>Herald</cite>, <cite>Post</cite>,
and <em>Advertiser</em> must likewise be included;&mdash;and it
would be folly to omit the <cite>Sun</cite>, <cite>Globe</cite>, and <cite>Standard</cite>.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;and what about the <cite>Daily News</cite> and the
<cite>Express</cite>?” asked Mr. Styles, apparently astonished
that no reference should have been made to those
print.</p>

<p>“The <cite>Daily News</cite>!” ejaculated the agent, in perfect
wonderment: “the <cite>Express</cite>!” he cried, in horrified
amazement. “Excuse me, my dear friend&mdash;but are
you mad? have you taken leave of your senses?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” responded Mr. Styles, in his usual
calm, business-like manner. “What makes you
think so?”</p>

<p>“What makes me think so!” repeated the agent:
“why, the idea that you should for an instant entertain
the notion of advertising in those contemptible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
abortions! They are a perfect disgrace to newspaper
literature, sir,” proceeded the agent, who was speaking
conscientiously, and indeed truly. “Did you ever
happen to read the <cite>Daily News</cite>?”</p>

<p>“I have never seen the paper in my life,” answered
Mr. Styles: “I had only heard of it.”</p>

<p>“And you are not likely to see it,” returned the
agent, “unless you go into the heart of Wapping or
explore the back slums of Whitechapel. No respectable
newsman keeps it: not that newsmen are more
particular than other shop-keepers&mdash;but they only
keep what they can sell, Mr. Styles. As for the
<cite>Express</cite>, it is a regular cheat of an evening paper&mdash;made
up entirely of the articles in the <cite>Daily News</cite>,
without even having the bad grammar and the typographical
errors corrected. But both prints are the
most contemptible threepenny things I ever saw in
my life; and one would be inclined to fancy that all
the real newspaper talent had been absorbed by the
pre-existing journals, leaving only the meanest literary
scrubs in London to <em>do</em> the <cite>News</cite> and the <cite>Express</cite>.”</p>

<p>“And yet I thought that the <cite>News</cite> had been started
under the auspices of Mr. Charles Dickens&mdash;the immortal
<em>Boz</em>?” said Mr. Styles, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“So it was,” replied the advertising agent: “but
the name of Charles Dickens was rather damnatory
than useful to a newspaper-speculation. Every one
must admit that <em>Boz</em> is a great novelist&mdash;a very great
novelist indeed&mdash;the Fielding of his age; but he is
totally incapable of writing for a newspaper. The
proprietors of the <cite>News</cite> made a tremendous splash
with his name; but they only created a quagmire for
themselves to flounder in. When their paper was first
coming out, every body thought it was to do wonders.
The <cite>Times</cite> was to lose half its subscribers; and the
<cite>Chronicle</cite> was to be ruined altogether. But, alas!
never did so labouring a mountain produce such a contemptible
mouse; and people began to fancy that
the wags engaged on <cite>Punch</cite> had started the <cite>Daily
News</cite> as a grand parody on the newspaper press. The
leaders were rubbish&mdash;the criticisms of new works, mere
nonsense&mdash;the dramatic reviews, utter balderdash. It
however seems that in the lowest depths there is a
deeper still even with the bathos of journalists; for when
the <cite>News</cite> tumbled down (which it soon did) to a two-penny
halfpenny print, the rubbish, the nonsense, and
the balderdash became more astounding still. There
is a young man named Bilk who does the ‘<em>moral department</em>’
of the paper; and he is the most grovelling
ass that ever was created. He undertakes to
review a whole batch of cheap publications in a lump;
but what he calls <em>reviewing</em> is nothing else than <em>abusing</em>
the works with an insolence so cool, and a rashness
so indiscriminate that he must be as consummate
a coxcomb as he is an unprincipled ruffian. The
<cite>News</cite> affects a moral tone, and entrusts its conscience
to this half-buffoon&mdash;half-barbarian, in the hope that
the lucubrations of the ungrammatical scribe may acquire
for it the reputation of a serious, sober, and sedate
journal. The despicable being to whom I allude
is the son of the proprietor of the <cite>Assinœum</cite>&mdash;a paper
which Bulwer mauled and exposed so terribly in one
of his admirable novels many years ago. The articles
in the <cite>Assinœum</cite> may be termed <span class="smcap">Twaddle upon
Stilts</span>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are really very inveterate in your denunciations
of these prints,” observed Mr. Styles, who
having an hour to spare, did not experience any impatience
in listening to the agent’s remarks.</p>

<p>“Not at all inveterate&mdash;only justly indignant,” was
the answer. “I am indignant, because I admire the
newspaper press of Great Britain&mdash;I am proud of it&mdash;I
glory in belonging to the country which possesses it;
and therefore when I see journalism prostituted to the
lowest and meanest purposes&mdash;when I behold such despicable
abortions as the <cite>Daily News</cite> and the <cite>Express</cite>
daring to show themselves in that sphere where respectability
and talent alone existed until those threepenny
things made their appearance,&mdash;I am angry&mdash;I
am disgusted! Only see how the <cite>News</cite> has been
tinkered and hacked about with the idea of making it
a property. First it was five-pence&mdash;then it was two-pence
halfpenny&mdash;next it was three-pence;&mdash;and yet
with all this derogatory experimentalising, the owners
have failed to make it a property. What a miserable
thing does it look, with its beggarly three columns of
advertisements! The <cite>Times</cite> has as many in a day as
the <cite>News</cite> has had altogether since its sickly existence
began. The very Parliamentary Reporters engaged
upon the <cite>News</cite> are ashamed of their connexion with
such a scurvy affair; and the doorkeeper of the Gallery
of the House of Commons looks on them with kind
commiseration, knowing how degrading it must be to
their feelings to take their places in the seats allotted
to the representatives of that three-penny hodgepodge.
You never see the <cite>News</cite> quoted from nor
alluded to by its contemporaries. It is not recognised
as a member of the newspaper press. It has tried
all imaginable kinds of manœuvres to force itself into
notoriety,&mdash;sometimes currying favour with the superior
journals, and at others abusing them; but
all to no purpose. Its contemporaries will <em>not</em> notice
it: they will not be bullied nor coaxed into such
condescension. Why&mdash;would you believe that the
very Editor is heartily ashamed of his post: but he
knows that if he resigned it, he should be compelled
to relapse into the lowest walks of penny-a-lining,
whence he was dragged forth to conduct the <em>thing</em>.”</p>

<p>“How is it possible that such a contemptible journal
continues in existence?” asked Mr. Styles.</p>

<p>“There! now you puzzle me indeed!” exclaimed
the advertising agent. “The question you have put
to me involves one of the greatest mysteries of London;
and I am quite incapable of affording you the solution.
Time will however show: for, in this case, time <em>must</em>
clear up all doubt and uncertainty regarding the
matter. For the present, however, take my advice
and refrain from advertising in a paper which is contemptible
in circulation and influence&mdash;scurrilous<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
hypocritical, according to circumstances, in its literary
articles&mdash;and wishy-washy in the extreme in its
leaders.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am excessively obliged to you for this most
useful warning,” observed Mr. Bubbleton Styles. “You
have nothing to say against the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>&mdash;the
<cite>Sunday Times</cite>&mdash;<cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All good papers!” exclaimed the advertising
agent. “But here is a list of those metropolitan and
provincial journals in which I should recommend you
to advertise.”</p>

<p>“I place myself entirely in your hands,” answered
the promoter of the grandest railway scheme ever devised:
and, thrusting his hands into his breeches
pockets, he rattled a little silver and a great many
halfpence, saying, “Shall I give you a hundred or so
in advance? or will you send in the account&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pray do not think of offering any sum in advance,
Mr. Styles&mdash;my dear Mr. Styles!” cried the agent.
“It is but a trifle: three hundred guineas will cover
the outlay for this first batch of advertisements&mdash;and
I will send in my little account to the secretary when
the Board meets.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” rejoined the promoter;&mdash;and, having
come to this excellent understanding, the two gentlemen
parted&mdash;Mr. Styles betaking himself to Garraway’s
Coffee-house, where he ate his lunch standing
at the bar, and afterwards returning to his office at
Crosby Hall Chambers.</p>

<span class="medium">PERDITA.</span></h2>

<p>A week had elapsed since the arrival of Mrs. and Miss
Fitzhardinge in the great metropolis; and as yet they
appeared to be no nearer to an acquaintanceship with
Charles Hatfield than they were on the day when they
first beheld him issue from Lord Ellingham’s mansion;&mdash;for
that it was he whom they had seen on the occasion
alluded to, the mother had satisfactorily ascertained.</p>

<p>Indeed, the old woman had not been idle. Every
evening, for a couple of hours, did she watch in the
immediate vicinity of the Earl’s dwelling to obtain an
interview with the young man: but he did not appear
to go out after dusk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhardinge accordingly began to think of
changing her tactics, and endeavouring to catch him
in the day-time, when fortune at last favoured her
views;&mdash;for on the eighth night of her loiterings in
Pall Mall, she had the satisfaction of seeing him sally
forth shortly after nine o’clock.</p>

<p>Unhesitatingly accosting him, she said, “Mr. Hatfield,
will you accord me your attention for a few
moments?”</p>

<p>The young man turned towards her, and beheld a
very ugly, plainly-attired, old lady: he nevertheless
answered her respectfully, because she had addressed
him in a manner denoting genteel breeding. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
should observe, too, that she had purposely assumed a
humble apparel on the occasion of these evening
watchings, in order to avoid the chance of attracting
the attention of passers-by or policemen, who would
naturally have wondered to see a handsomely apparelled
person thus loitering about.</p>

<p>“Certainly, madam,” replied Charles: “I will listen
to any thing you may have to say to me. Will you
walk into the house which I have just left: ’tis the
mansion of the Earl of Ellingham.”</p>

<p>“I know well who lives there, Mr. Hatfield,” answered
the old woman; “and it is precisely because I
wish to speak to you alone, that I have accosted you
in the street. Can you pardon such boldness?”</p>

<p>“If your business with me be of importance, madam,”
said Charles, “no apology can be necessary on
your part.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;my business is indeed of importance,” returned
Mrs. Fitzhardinge, with mysterious emphasis.
“But I cannot speak to you here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have already requested you to accompany me to
the house where I am residing with my relatives and
friends,” said Charles, with the least indication of impatience
in his manner.</p>

<p>“And I have already assured you that I am anxious
to converse with you alone,” responded the old woman,
nothing daunted. “Do not mistrust me, sir&mdash;do not
suppose that I have accosted you for the purpose of
soliciting any assistance of a pecuniary kind&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then, madam, what <em>do</em> you require of me?” asked
Charles, hastily.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes’ private conversation&mdash;on matters of
importance&mdash;of deep importance to yourself!” replied
Mrs. Fitzhardinge, as rapidly and as firmly as the
other had spoken: then, before he had time to make
any rejoinder, she added, “For your own sake, Mr.
Hatfield&mdash;if for no other consideration&mdash;you will accompany
me to my own dwelling, which is close at
hand. What! you hesitate? Then continue to cherish
the secret grief which weighs upon your mind&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! what did you say?” ejaculated the young
man, starting as if a chord had been touched so as to
vibrate to his very heart’s core.</p>

<p>“I mean that if you refuse to accompany me, you
will repent the loss of an opportunity to receive revelations
nearly concerning yourself, and which opportunity
may not speedily occur again.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Fitzhardinge uttered these words, she fixed
a strange, mysterious, and almost ominous look upon
Charles Hatfield, who was bewildered and amazed by
her language. The old woman had dealt her random
shots with good effect; and she experienced an inward
triumph at her skill, and a sure conviction of its success.</p>

<p>“Who are you? and what do you know of me?”
demanded Charles, breaking silence abruptly after
more than a minute’s pause, and speaking in a tone of
earnestness denoting mingled suspense, wonder, and
curiosity.</p>

<p>“My name is Fitzhardinge,” replied the old woman;
“and I know all&mdash;every thing concerning you,&mdash;aye,
much more than you can possibly suspect. But not
another word of explanation will I utter here; and
you may now decide whether you will at once accompany
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> accompany you, madam,” interrupted
Charles Hatfield, in a decided manner. “In which
direction does your abode lie?”</p>

<p>“Five minutes will take us thither,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>The old woman and the young gentleman now proceeded
in silence towards Suffolk Street, Pall Mall&mdash;the
latter wondering who his companion might be,
what she could possibly have to communicate to him,
and how she had acquired the information which she
alleged to be so important and was about to impart.
He naturally associated the promised revelations with
the mysterious circumstances which he had so recently
fathomed by means of the letters and manuscripts
found in the secret recess of the library at Lord
Ellingham’s mansion;&mdash;and yet he was at a loss to
conceive how a Mrs. Fitzhardinge, whose name was
entirely strange to him, could possibly have any connexion
with his own family affairs. At one moment
he fancied that the proceeding on her part was nothing
more nor less than a plot to inveigle him to some
den for predatory purposes: for he had heard that
London abounded in such horrible places, and also in
persons who adopted every kind of stratagem to lure
the unwary into those fatal snares. But when he
considered the quarter of the great metropolis in
which his companion evidently resided, as she had
assured him that her abode was only a few minutes’
walk from the spot where she had first accosted him,&mdash;when
he again noticed the respectability of her appearance,
and reflected that there was something
superior in her manners, language, and address,&mdash;and
lastly, when he remembered that amidst circumstances
so complicated and mysterious as those which regarded
his own family, it was highly possible for that aged
female to be interested in them in some way or another,&mdash;he
blamed himself for his misgivings, and resolved
to see the end of the adventure.</p>

<p>Scarcely was his mind thus made up, when Mrs.
Fitzhardinge turned into Suffolk Street; and in less
than another minute, she knocked in an authoritative
manner at the door of a handsome house. The summons
was instantaneously responded to by a respectable
female-servant; and Charles Hatfield followed
the old lady up a wide stair-case lighted by a lamp
which a statue in a niche held in its hand. On reaching
the first landing, Mrs. Fitzhardinge threw open a
door, saying, “Walk into this room, Mr. Hatfield: I
will join you in a few moments.”</p>

<p>Charles entered&mdash;and the door immediately closed
behind him.</p>

<p>The young man found himself in a well-furnished
apartment, in which the light of the wax candles
placed upon the mantel was reflected in a handsome
mirror. The atmosphere was rendered perfumed and
refreshing by vases of fresh flowers tastefully disposed
around: and on a side-table stood a large globe filled
with the clearest water, in which gold and silver fish
were disporting. The curtains were closed over the
windows; but still the room was cool and the air
grateful in that sultry summer season.</p>

<p>These observations were made at a rapid glance;&mdash;and
then Charles Hatfield’s looks were concentrated in
the cynosure which instantly absorbed all interest&mdash;all
attention. For, half sitting, half reclining upon
the sofa, was a being of such transcendant beauty that
never in the wildest of his dreams had he conceived
the like. When reading a novel or a poem, his imagination
had often depicted to itself the semblance of
the heroine&mdash;and this mental portraiture was invariably
drawn with the utmost perfection of form and feature
which impassioned and enthusiastic youth could devise.
But no flight&mdash;no soaring of that fervid imagination
had ever yet idealised such dazzling, brilliant
charms as those which now met his astonished gaze,&mdash;charms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
that intoxicated while they delighted, and
that ravished while they infused a warm voluptuousness
into the soul of the beholder.</p>

<p>And, in sooth, well might Charles Hatfield experience
ineffable feelings and tender emotions as he
contemplated the fiend in an angel’s shape that was
half reclining on the sofa; for Perdita was surpassingly
lovely on this occasion! She was attired in a
light pink muslin dress, made very low in the body,
so that her neck and shoulders were set off in all their
dazzling whiteness against the deep purple velvet of
the sofa&mdash;and her full, swelling, firm bosom was more
than half revealed. Her hair was arranged in long
ringlets, glittering like hyperions, luxuriant, and
sweeping those glowing globes that appeared to heave
to their caresses. Her large grey eyes beamed with
voluptuous languor, although a brilliant light shone
in the depths of the dark pupils;&mdash;and her vermilion
lips, parted with a smile, displayed the white and even
rows of pearls, so faultless in their beauty. The
slightly sun-burnt tinge of her face appeared to be
the rich hue of an Italian complexion&mdash;the carnation
glow of health, and youth, and warm blood animating
her cheeks. Then her arms were naked,&mdash;those arms
which were dazzlingly white, robust, and yet admirably
modelled, and which seemed ready to stretch out and
clasp a favoured lover to the panting breast. One foot
was raised on the sofa&mdash;the other rested on an ottoman;&mdash;and
thus, as Charles Hatfield’s eyes swept the
rich and fine proportions&mdash;the undulating contours of
that splendid form, it seemed to him as if a halo of
voluptuousness surrounded this enchanting being&mdash;a
very perfume of beauty enveloped her in its intoxicating
influence.</p>

<p>She had heard him ascending the stairs&mdash;and she
had purposely placed herself in an attitude which
should seem as if he had disturbed her unexpectedly,
and thus serve as an apology for the negligent abandonment
of limb which gave to her position an air
alike wanton and lascivious. While she, therefore,
affected to gaze on him in soft surprise, he was intently
devouring her with looks of unfeigned amazement;&mdash;and
while she still retained that voluptuous
attitude as if unwittingly, he was rivetted to the spot
near the door where he had stopped short on first
catching sight of her. This dumb-show on the part
of both,&mdash;artificial with her, and real with him,&mdash;lasted
for nearly a minute;&mdash;and during that time Perdita
had an opportunity of surveying the young man’s
handsome appearance with even more searching scrutiny
than when she had seen him in Pall Mall the
very day of her arrival in London,&mdash;while, on his side,
Charles Hatfield had leisure to scan a combination of
charms such as transcended all his ideal creations, and
which, had he beheld them in a picture, he would have
declared to be impossible of realization.</p>

<p>Again must we observe how different was this elegantly-attired,
captivating creature as she now appeared,
from the ragged, way-worn wanderer that she
was when first we introduced her to our readers! But
oh! dangerous&mdash;trebly dangerous Perdita,&mdash;a snake
with the loveliest skin&mdash;a demon with the most heavenly
form&mdash;utter profligacy in the most witching
guise!</p>

<p>And now the young man, who has been brought
within the sphere of this perilous influence, recovers
his self-possession so far as to be able to stammer forth
an apology for what he conceives to be an intrusion
occasioned by some strange mistake.</p>

<p>“No excuse is necessary, sir,” replies Perdita; “The
lady whom you state to have conducted you hither, is
my mother; and she has doubtless sought her chamber
for a few minutes to change her attire. Pray be
seated.”</p>

<p>But Charles Hatfield once more stood still&mdash;rivetted
to the spot, after having advanced a few paces towards
Perdita;&mdash;for the sound of her voice, so sweetly musical&mdash;so
enchantingly harmonious, appeared to inspire
him with ecstatic emotions and infuse an ineffable
delight into his very soul.</p>

<p>Then Perdita arose from the sofa, and indicating a
chair close by, again invited the young man to be
seated,&mdash;accomplishing this courtesy with so ravishing
a grace and such a charming smile, that he felt himself
intoxicated&mdash;bewildered&mdash;enchanted by the magic of
her beauty, the melody of her silver tones, and the
soft persuasion of her manner. For the consciousness
of almost superhuman beauty had rendered Perdita
emulative of every art and taught her to study every
movement which might invest her with a winning way
and a witching power;&mdash;and thus this singular young
woman had acquired a politeness so complete that it
seemed intuitive, and a polish so refined that it appeared
to have been gained by long and unvaried
association with the highest classes.</p>

<p>Sinking into the chair thus gracefully offered him,
Charles Hatfield could not take his eyes off the magnificent
creature who remained standing for a few seconds
after he was seated; for, affecting to alter the position
of one of the wax candles on the mantel, as if it were
too near the mirror, she placed herself in such an attitude
that the young man might obtain a perfect view
of the flowing outlines of her glorious form,&mdash;the splendid
arching of the swan-like neck&mdash;the luxurious fulness
of the bust&mdash;the tapering slenderness of the waist&mdash;the
plump and rounded arms&mdash;the large, projecting
hips&mdash;and the finely proportioned feet and ankles.</p>

<p>The effect thus produced by the artful, designing
creature, whose voluptuous position seemed all natural
and all unstudied, was precisely that which she had
intended;&mdash;for Charles Hatfield experienced a delirium
of emotions till then unknown&mdash;and he felt
that he could almost spring from his seat, catch that
bewitching form in his arms, and, covering her with
kisses, exclaim, “Pardon me&mdash;but I am mad&mdash;intoxicated&mdash;raving
with passion!”</p>

<p>“My mother will not be many minutes, sir,” said
Perdita, now returning to her seat upon the sofa;
“and in the meantime I must solicit you to exercise
your patience&mdash;for I am afraid you will find me but a
dull companion.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” cried Charles, enthusiastically; then
fearing that he had spoken in too decided and earnest
a manner to one who was a perfect stranger, he added
in a more subdued and reserved tone, “But perhaps I
am intruding on your privacy, as I am afraid that
when I entered&mdash;I mean, I fear that I&mdash;I disturbed
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I certainly was not aware that my mother expected
a visitor this evening,” answered Perdita;
“and it is I who should apologise, inasmuch as you
caught me in such a lounging, lazy attitude. But
since I have been in London I have experienced a
heaviness in the atmosphere that engenders indolence&mdash;for
I have hitherto been accustomed to the
country.”</p>

<p>“Then you have not long resided in London, Miss
Fitzhardinge?” said Charles, hazarding this mode of
address with the determination of ascertaining whether
the beautiful young woman were married or single.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>“We have only been in this city for one week,”
she replied in an acquiescent way which convinced
him that she had not changed the parental name by
means of wedlock&mdash;a discovery that infused a secret
glow of pleasure into his very soul, though at the
same instant his heart smote him as if he were already
playing a treacherous part in respect to Lady Frances
Ellingham. “No,” continued Perdita, “we have not
long resided in London. Urgent affairs have compelled
my mother to visit the capital; and as our
stay is likely to be of considerable duration, we are
about to take a house. For my part, I am not sorry
that we are thus to settle in London: for, in spite of
its oppressive atmosphere, its smoke, and its noise, it
has many attractions.”</p>

<p>“You have already seen enough, then, to induce
you to prefer London to the country, Miss Fitzhardinge?”
said Charles, now admiring the fine
aquiline profile of which he was suffered to obtain a
perfect view, as Perdita half averted her looks on purpose,
though quite in a natural manner.</p>

<p>“I have seen enough to render me an enthusiastic
admirer of your great city,” she replied, now turning
her full countenance upon him, and smiling so as to
display her brilliant teeth: “but I am anxious to
behold more, and my wish cannot very readily be
gratified. For, save our attorney, we have no acquaintances&mdash;no
friends in London: we are perfect
strangers here&mdash;and we cannot very well ask our solicitor
to escort us to the theatre and to those places of
amusement which ladies would hardly choose to visit
unless accompanied and protected by a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that <em>you</em>, Miss Fitzhardinge, should
have to experience the want of such a <em>chaperon</em>?”
demanded Charles Hatfield, again hurried by his enthusiasm
into language too little reserved and distant
for a perfect stranger to address to a young lady:&mdash;at
least, so he thought and feared immediately after he
had made the observation.</p>

<p>“It is very possible,” replied Perdita, in a mild and
almost plaintive tone. “In the country we had numerous
friends; but here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And the artful creature, stopping short, stooped
down to pick up her handkerchief as if to apply it to
her eyes:&mdash;at the same instant Charles, obeying the
impulse of polite attention, bent down also to save the
lady the trouble and perform the little act of courtesy,
when their hair&mdash;their very cheeks came in contact,&mdash;accidentally
as the confused and bewildered Charles
imagined, but intentionally on the part of the wanton
and astute Perdita.</p>

<p>And that contact&mdash;Oh! it was thrilling in the extreme;
and Charles Hatfield felt as if his veins ran
with liquid fire;&mdash;for the perfume exhaled from the
lady’s hair&mdash;the velvety feeling of the luxuriant curls&mdash;the
softness and the warmth of her carnation cheek&mdash;and
then the view which he could not possibly avoid
for a moment obtaining of the glowing breast which
her stooping posture completely revealed,&mdash;all this was
sufficient to madden him with passion and excite him
to a degree when all self-command becomes nearly
impossible. But he still possessed a sufficiency of
mental energy to controul himself; and, stammering
forth an awkward apology, he hurriedly observed,
“Would you not think me too bold, Miss Fitzhardinge,
I should be proud to offer my services as
a <em>chaperon</em> to yourself&mdash;and your mother,” he added
for decency’s sake.</p>

<p>The instant this offer was made,&mdash;made without the
least forethought and in the confusion of the young
man’s mind arising from the incidents just related,&mdash;he
repented of his rashness: he would have given
worlds to be able to recall the proposal. For, in a
moment to his mind flashed the image of the lovely
Lady Frances Ellingham&mdash;the reflection that he was
offering his attentions to a young person totally unknown
to him&mdash;the remembrance that he had many
matters of importance to occupy his leisure&mdash;and the
general impression that he had committed himself in
a most singularly foolish and inconsiderate manner.</p>

<p>Perdita saw what was passing in his mind: at least,
she perceived that he repented of the proposal which
he had so precipitately made, and which it had rejoiced
her so much to receive;&mdash;and she resolved to conquer
his scruples&mdash;overcome his repugnance&mdash;and confirm
him in the act of vassalage to which her transcendent
charms and her wanton arts had already prompted
him.</p>

<p>Laying her soft warm hand upon his, and approaching
her countenance so near to his own that her fragrant
breath fanned his cheek, she said, in a tone
apparently of deep emotion, “Mr. Hatfield, this proposal
is so generous&mdash;so kind&mdash;so unexpected, that I
know not how to answer you otherwise than by
expressing my sincere gratitude. And yet&mdash;so frankly
have you made the offer, that it would be a miserable
affectation on my part to hesitate or to appear leas
candid and open in accepting it. I <em>do</em> therefore accept
it, my dear sir&mdash;and with renewed thanks. And think
not that in constituting yourself the friend&mdash;for in such
a light must I henceforth consider you&mdash;of Miss Fitzhardinge,
you are doing aught derogatory to yourself.
No: for my mother is descended from an old and illustrious
family,&mdash;a family which has enumerated amongst
its members personages of rank, eminence, and renown;&mdash;and
should the Chancery suit which she has come
to London to prosecute, result favourably to her, she
will recover an enormous fortune that has been accumulating
for years through remaining in a dormant
state.”</p>

<p>While Perdita was delivering this tissue of falsehoods
with an air of the most profound sincerity, she
still kept her hand upon that of the young man&mdash;still
retained her countenance near his own&mdash;and likewise
fixed upon him looks at once languishing, tender, and
voluptuous.</p>

<p>Again did he lose all power of sober reflection and,
completely yielding to the influence which the syren
had in so short a time gained over him, he said, “I
shall be proud and delighted to act as your escort, Miss
Fitzhardinge. But you just now addressed me by my
name&mdash;and yet I thought you were unprepared for my
presence here this evening.”</p>

<p>“I was well aware that my mother wished to see
you on particular business,” said Perdita, having a
ready reply for every question that might be put to
her; “and therefore when I saw you enter the room, I
concluded that you must be Mr. Charles Hatfield.”</p>

<p>“And are you acquainted with the nature of the
business concerning which Mrs. Fitzhardinge desired
to speak with me?” inquired the young man, wondering
why the old lady did not make her appearance.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I am well informed on that subject,” returned
Perdita; “but pray do not ask me to talk to you on
business! I detest the very name! And now perhaps
you will consider me a silly&mdash;flighty&mdash;volatile creature&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I consider you to be an angel of beauty!” exclaimed
Charles, unable to restrain the raptures which
hurried him on to this impassioned ejaculation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>“I was told before I came to London that the
gentlemen of the great metropolis were very fond of
paying silly young ladies vain and empty compliments,”
said Perdita, looking with good-humoured
archness at her companion, while her eyes beamed
with wickedness and her bosom heaved visibly.</p>

<p>“Is it the first time that you have been assured of
your beauty?” asked Charles, still carried away by an
uncontroullable influence.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not precisely the first,” responded Perdita,
with a <em>naivet&eacute;</em> so admirably assumed that her companion
believed it to be completely genuine. “There
was a young gentleman&mdash;or rather a nobleman, but I
must not mention his name&mdash;in the country, who
offered me his hand;&mdash;and he paid me many very fine
compliments.”</p>

<p>“And you accepted the proposal? you are engaged
to him?” exclaimed Charles, with a strange fluttering
of the heart.</p>

<p>“Neither the one nor the other,” answered Perdita.
“I could not love him&mdash;and therefore I declined the
honour. My mother was angry with me, and talked
a great deal about the excellence of the match and so
forth: but I was obstinate&mdash;yes, very obstinate, Mr.
Hatfield,” she said archly; “for never&mdash;never,” she
continued, her tone suddenly becoming earnest and her
manner serious,&mdash;“never could I bestow my hand
where I cannot likewise give my heart!”</p>

<p>“And you have resolved wisely, Miss Fitzhardinge!”
exclaimed Charles. “Matrimony without sincere
affection can afford no promise of happiness. But
one so beautiful as yourself&mdash;impressed too with such
sterling sentiments and harbouring such pure principles&mdash;oh,
you will prove indeed a treasure to the man
who is fortunate enough to secure your heart and
hand!”</p>

<p>“Again you compliment me, Mr. Hatfield,” said
Perdita, looking down and blushing,&mdash;for even her
very blushes she could command at pleasure. “In
reference, however, to the observation you have just
made, I should remark that I have never yet met with
one of your sex whom I could comprehend fully and
who could understand me. I admire openness, candour
and sincerity,&mdash;that generous frankness, too,
which at once establishes friendship and dissipates
cold formality. For I believe that the trammels of
ceremonial politeness positively spoil the heart,&mdash;tutoring
it to curb its enthusiasm where enthusiasm
would be so natural! I know not how to express myself
clearly; but what I mean to imply is this&mdash;that I
am a believer in the possibility of friendship at first
sight&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And of love at first sight also?” exclaimed Charles
Hatfleld, in an impassioned tone.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and of love at first sight also,” repeated
Perdita, again hanging down her head&mdash;again commanding
a deep blush&mdash;and likewise speaking in a
low, melting tone of deep emotion, as she drew a long
sigh.</p>

<p>“Was it that possibility of experiencing the feeling
of friendship at first sight, which led you to accept
my proposed services as an escort to the places of
public amusement?” enquired Charles.</p>

<p>“Wherefore do you seek thus to probe the secret
feelings of my soul?” asked Perdita, turning upon
him a look indicative of mingled pleasure and amazement.</p>

<p>“Have I offended you by the question, charming
lady?” exclaimed Charles.</p>

<p>“Oh! I do not so readily take offence, Mr. Hatfield,”
cried Perdita. “But&mdash;frank, candid, and ingenuous
though I believe myself to be&mdash;I still have my little
feelings of pride, and I could not think of making an
avowal to a gentleman otherwise than as a reciprocity.”</p>

<p>“Then were I to declare sincerely and solemnly&mdash;and
on my honour as a man&mdash;that it was a sentiment
of friendship, experienced at first sight and according
to your own doctrine, which prompted me to
offer my services as a <em>chaperon</em>,” said Charles, hastily
and enthusiastically, “would you deign to answer my
question?”</p>

<p>“Such a declaration on your part, sir, would necessarily
elicit&mdash;nay, demand some kind of a response on
mine,” returned the artful beauty, looking down, and
tapping the carpet with her foot in such a manner
that her ankle peeped from beneath her dress, and the
young man’s eyes could catch a glimpse of the exquisitely
white skin through the net work of the
dainty silk stocking.</p>

<p>Charles hesitated: an avowal of friendship trembled
on his tongue&mdash;but he thought how dangerous such a
confession would be&mdash;he thought, too, of Lady Frances
Ellingham!</p>

<p>And Perdita again perceived that he hesitated; and
instantly had recourse to a new artifice to display her
charms to their utmost advantage. Stooping down,
she affected to arrange the ottoman in the most convenient
manner for her feet;&mdash;but, in this attitude
which seemed so natural, ingenuous, and artless, she
revealed so much of the treasures of her bosom that no
room was left for imaginings&mdash;and Charles Hatfield
felt himself seized with a delirium in which he would
have made over his soul to Satan had such been the
price demanded for the possession of Perdita.</p>

<p>“Miss Fitzhardinge,” he said, his voice almost
subdued and his tongue parched through the maddening
fierceness of passion, “on my honour as a gentleman,
I swear that the offer I ere now made you was
dictated by a feeling of friendship! Yes&mdash;of a friendship
that sprang up in my soul in a single instant&mdash;that
took birth in a moment&mdash;a friendship that
prompted me to declare how proud and delighted I
should be to act as your escort! For I am candid,
frank, and ingenuous as I perceive <em>you</em> to be,&mdash;and I
will give you another proof of the existence of these
qualities in respect to myself&mdash;even at the risk of
offending you. From the first moment that I set foot
in this room until now, I have experienced emotions
such as I never felt before. In my delirium I apostrophised
you as an angel of beauty;&mdash;and an angel of
beauty must you indeed be to exercise such prompt&mdash;such
speedy&mdash;such witching influence as that which
has enthralled me. For it appears as if there were a
spell upon me&mdash;an enchantment, from which there is
no escape. Sweet lady, pardon me for having spoken
thus frankly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I again assure you that I do not very readily take
offence,” answered Perdita: then, laying her hand
upon his&mdash;for the designing woman sought to excite
him almost to madness&mdash;and again approaching her
countenance so near his own that he could look into
the depth of her large, wanton eyes,&mdash;she said, “You
have made a certain avowal, and you have a right to
expect a candid and unreserved reply from me. Then
learn, Mr. Hatfield, that never should I have accepted
your services as a <em>chaperon</em>&mdash;never should we have
talked thus familiarly&mdash;never would you have been
suffered to read so much of my disposition as within
the last hour you have learnt&mdash;had not I likewise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
experienced a feeling of friendship at first sight for
you!”</p>

<p>“Oh! my God&mdash;this is happiness so unhoped&mdash;so
unlooked for&mdash;so unexpected, that I am bewildered-dazzled&mdash;amazed!”
murmured the young man, a mist
obscuring his brain&mdash;and yet a glorious, lustrous,
golden mist through which he seemed to catch
glimpses of paradise. “Friendship did you say,
charming lady? Yet is not friendship a dangerous
word for lips like ours to breathe&mdash;and a dangerous
sentiment for hearts like ours to feel?”</p>

<p>“You speak as if you were under an apprehension
that you are doing wrong?” said Perdita, in a tone of
soft reproach. “Oh! is this candour and frankness?
If you regret that you have pledged me your friendship&mdash;for
such I augur of your words&mdash;I release you,
Mr. Hatfield, from the bond: nay&mdash;I should be too
proud to ask you to adhere to it!”</p>

<p>And now the young man beheld the fascinating
woman in a new phasis of her charms;&mdash;for, with
that ready versatility of aspect and demeanour which
she had so completely at her command, she suddenly
invested herself with all the majesty of sublime
haughtiness;&mdash;no longer melting, tender, wanton, and
voluptuous as Venus&mdash;but terrible, domineering, superb,
and imperious as Juno,&mdash;no longer wearing the
cestus of the Goddess of Love&mdash;but grasping, as the
Queen of Heaven, the thunders of Olympian Jove.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed fire&mdash;her cheeks flushed&mdash;her nostrils
dilated&mdash;her lip curled&mdash;her neck arched proudly rather
than gracefully&mdash;her bosom heaved as if it would burst
the low corsage which only half restrained it&mdash;and
her very form seemed to draw itself up into a height,
which, even as she sate and of middling stature as she
was, appeared colossal at that moment to the astounded
gaze of the young man.</p>

<p>Never was artifice more successful&mdash;never was
triumph more complete, on one side;&mdash;never was defeat
more signal&mdash;never was humiliation more contrite,
on the other. For, overwhelmed as it were by
the sovereign majesty of that anger which he believed
himself to have provoked, Charles Hatfield fell upon
his knees before the haughty beauty, and seizing both
her hands in his, he extravagantly devoured them
with kisses, exclaiming, “Pardon&mdash;pardon!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: it is as frankly accorded as sincerely
demanded!” exclaimed Perdita, not offering to withdraw
her hands from the lips which were now glued to
them: and in an instant her whole manner and appearance
changed again&mdash;and when Charles Hatfield
ventured to look up into the syren’s face, he saw her
bending over him with cheeks flushed it is true, but
not by anger&mdash;and with eyes that seemed to swim in
wanton, liquid languor.</p>

<p>Rising from his suppliant posture, and now taking a
seat by the side of Perdita on the sofa,&mdash;relinquishing
her hands at the same time, for fear of giving offence
by retaining them,&mdash;the infatuated young man, drunk
with passion, said in a low murmuring tone, “We
have not been acquainted more than one hour, and we
have exchanged vows of friendship&mdash;is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;if you do not repent now, and never will repent
of that pledge on your part,” answered the dangerous
young woman, who thus conducted her designing
machinations with such consummate skill.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;never, never!” cried Hatfield. “And now
we know each other as well as if we had been intimate
since our infancy! To you, then, henceforth I am
<em>Charles</em>; and you are to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<em>Perdita</em>,” said she.</p>

<p>“Oh! beautiful&mdash;singular&mdash;and yet ominous name!”
exclaimed the young gentleman. “Yes&mdash;you are my
friend&mdash;my dear friend Perdita! And now, Perdita,
I will avail myself of this romantic yet not the less
sincere friendship that is established between us, to
ask you what caprice or fancy gave you so remarkable
a Christian name?”</p>

<p>“Because in my infancy&mdash;shortly after my birth,
and before I was baptised&mdash;I was lost,&mdash;or rather
stolen by gipsies,” answered Perdita, investing herself
and her history with as much of the charm of mysticism
as possible: “and when I was recovered from the
kidnappers by my parents, they christened me Perdita&mdash;or
<span class="smcap">The Lost One</span>.”</p>

<p>“Every thing connected with you seems to be imbued
with deep and enthralling interest, my dear
friend,” said Charles: “a supernatural halo appears to
surround you! Your beauty is of a nature so superior
to aught of female loveliness that I ever before beheld&mdash;your
voice has something so indescribably melting
and musical that it awakens echoes in the inmost
recesses of the soul&mdash;your history is strange, wild, and
impressive in its very commencement&mdash;your disposition
is characterised by a frankness and candour so
generous that it inspires and reciprocates profound
friendship the instant it meets a kindred spirit&mdash;and
then there is about you a something so witching, so
captivating, so enchanting, that the best and most
virtuous of men would lose all sense of duty, did you&mdash;sweet
syren that you are&mdash;undertake to lead them
astray.”</p>

<p>“If I have indeed found a kindred spirit in you,
Charles,” said Perdita, taking his hand and pressing
it as if in grateful and innocent rapture to her heaving
bosom&mdash;an act which only tended to inflame the
young man almost to madness,&mdash;“I shall have gained
that which I have long sought, and never yet found.
For my heart has hitherto been as complete a stranger
to a sincere friendship as to love! When I spoke ere
now of our friends in the country, I meant those acquaintances
whom custom denominates by the other
title.”</p>

<p>“Perdita&mdash;my friend Perdita, the amity that we
have pledged each other shall be eternal!” exclaimed
Charles, in an impassioned tone.</p>

<p>“And you will return to visit me to-morrow?” said
the young woman, her fine grey eyes beaming with
an unsettled lustre, as if the mingled voluptuousness of
day and night met in those splendid, eloquent orbs.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;oh! yes!” cried Charles, as if it were unnecessary
to have asked the question. “And now I
shall leave you, Perdita: I shall depart to feast my
imagination on the pleasures of this interview.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the young man pressed Perdita’s
hand to his lips, and hurried from the room, intoxicated
with a delirium of bliss, and scarcely conscious
of where he was or whither he was going.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXI">CHAPTER CXXXI.<br />

<span class="medium">THE SYREN’S ARTS AND CHARMS.</span></h2>

<p>On gaining the street, Charles Hatfield hurried along
like one demented,&mdash;positively reeling with the influence
which Perdita’s charms, allurements, and arts
had shed upon him,&mdash;and feeling within his soul a
glow of such ineffable happiness that he appeared to
have been snatched from the world and wafted to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Elysium. Had he just quitted a banquet where his
head had been pillowed on the bosom of beauty, and
the fair hands of the charmer had held to his lips
brimming goblets of champagne of which he had
drunk deeply, he would not have experienced a more
extraordinary degree of excitement, nor such felicitous
sensations.</p>

<div id="i_081" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But the moment of reaction came; and though the
revulsion was slow, yet it was powerful&mdash;and even
painful.</p>

<p>He had found his way into Saint James’s Park; and
hurrying to the most secluded quarter, he was still
giving rein to the luxuriousness of his thoughts, when
it suddenly flashed to his mind that he had not received
from the lips of Mrs. Fitzhardinge the important
communications which she had promised him.
Indeed, he had not seen her again from the moment
when she showed him into the drawing-room where
he had found the lovely creature to whom his friendship&mdash;his
eternal friendship was so solemnly plighted.</p>

<p>Striking his repeater,&mdash;for obscurity reigned in that
portion of the park where he now was, and he could
not see the position of the hands of his watch,&mdash;he
was amazed to discover that his interview with Perdita
had lasted two hours.</p>

<p>Two hours!&mdash;and it scarcely seemed to have occupied
ten minutes!</p>

<p>But now his reasoning faculties returned;&mdash;and he
began to ask himself innumerable questions.</p>

<p>“Wherefore was I conducted to that house? was it
really to receive important revelations from the
mother? or only to be thrown into the way of the
daughter? Why did not the mother make her appearance
once during those two hours which I passed
with the daughter? Was it a stratagem devised by
designing women to ensnare me? or was Mrs. Fitzhardinge
unexpectedly prevented from joining us so
soon as she had intended? My God! I am bewildered&mdash;I
know not what to think! For if they be women
of evil repute and having sinister aims in view, Perdita
would not have given me to understand that they
are at ease in their circumstances, and hope to be even
rich very shortly? But that young creature&mdash;so
beautiful,&mdash;so indescribably&mdash;so enchantingly beautiful,&mdash;what
object could she have in pledging her
friendship to me&mdash;to <em>me</em>, a stranger whom she had
never seen before? Fool that I am! wherefore did I
give a similar promise to her? Oh! it was in a moment
of delirium&mdash;of enchantment&mdash;of intoxication;&mdash;and
might it not also have been the same with her?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Ah! that belief would denote a boundless vanity on
my part;&mdash;and yet women have their sudden caprices&mdash;their
instantaneous attachments, as well as men!
Yes&mdash;it must be so&mdash;Perdita loves me!&mdash;she loves
me&mdash;and I already love her deeply&mdash;madly, in return!”</p>

<p>But scarcely had these thoughts passed through
his brain, when his heart smote him painfully&mdash;severely,&mdash;reproaching
him with his treachery towards
Lady Frances Ellingham, and suggesting a
comparison between the retiring, bashful beauty of
this charming young creature, and the warm, impassioned,
bold loveliness of the syren Perdita.</p>

<p>The more Charles Hatfield pondered upon the strange
scene that had taken place in Suffolk Street, the less
satisfied did he feel with himself. He saw that his
conduct had been rash, precipitate, and thoughtless;&mdash;and
yet there was something so pleasurable in what
he blamed himself for, that he was not altogether
contrite. Indeed, he felt&mdash;he admitted to his own
secret soul, that had he the power of recalling the last
two hours, he should act precisely in the same manner
over again. For when he thought of Perdita,&mdash;remembered
her witcheries&mdash;dwelt on her faultless
charms&mdash;and recalled to mind the mystic fascination
of her language and the delicious tones of her voice,&mdash;his
imagination grew inflamed&mdash;his blood ran rapidly
and hotly in his veins&mdash;and it seemed that were she
Satan in female shape, he could sell his soul to her!</p>

<p>It was late when he returned to Ellingham House;
and he repaired at once to his chamber. But he could
not sleep: the image of Perdita haunted him;&mdash;and
were it not so unseasonable an hour he would have
returned to Suffolk Street under pretence of soliciting
the promised revelations from Mrs. Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>When he retired to rest, and sleep did at last visit
his eyes, that beauteous image followed him in his
dreams. He thought that he was seated by the side
of the witching fair one on the sofa, and that she was
reclining, half-embraced, on his breast, with her countenance,
flushed and wanton in expression, upturned
towards his own. This delicious position appeared to
last for a long&mdash;long time, neither uttering a word, but
drinking deep draughts of love from each other’s eyes.
Then he fancied that he stooped to press his lips to her
delicious mouth;&mdash;but at that instant the lovely face
changed&mdash;elongating, and undergoing so horrible a
transformation that his eyes were fixed in appalling
fascination upon it,&mdash;while, at the same time, he became
sensible that the soft and supple form which he
held in his arms was undergoing a rapid and signal
change likewise,&mdash;till the whole being, lately so charming,
so tender, and so loving, was changed into a
hideous serpent. A terrible cry escaped him&mdash;and he
awoke!</p>

<p>The rays of the gorgeous sun were streaming in at
the window, as Charles Hatfield started from his slumber;
and, to his surprise, he found his father standing
by the side of the bed.</p>

<p>“You have been labouring under the influence of an
unpleasant dream, Charles,” said Mr. Hatfield, taking
his son’s hand.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;’twas indeed a hideous dream!” exclaimed
the young man, shuddering at the idea which still pursued
him.</p>

<p>“And was that dream a reflex of any thoughts
which occupy you when awake?” asked his father, in
a kind and anxious tone.</p>

<p>Charles surveyed his parent with astonishment, and
then became absolutely crimson in the face;&mdash;for this
early and unusual visit seemed to imply that its object
was in some way connected with matters that had
lately been occupying, as the reader knows, no inconsiderable
share of the young man’s reflections&mdash;we
mean, the family secrets into which he had so strangely
penetrated.</p>

<p>“Yes, Charles,” continued Mr. Hatfield; “I feared
that you had something upon your mind; and your
manner now confirms that apprehension. For the last
week you have not been the same gay, happy, lively
being you so lately were;&mdash;and, although you have
endeavoured to conceal your sorrow from observation,
yet it has not escaped the eyes of your affectionate
mother and myself. Tell me, Charles&mdash;tell me candidly,
I implore you&mdash;is it in consequence of the
discovery that we are your parents, and not mere
relatives&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear father,” exclaimed the young man,
“that discovery made me happy, I solemnly assure
you!”</p>

<p>“Then wherefore are you melancholy and thoughtful
at times?” asked Mr. Hatfield, in a tone of deep
interest.</p>

<p>“Melancholy and thoughtful!” repeated Charles,
mechanically.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear son: and even at this moment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Even at this moment,” still repeated Charles,
whose imagination was wandering to Suffolk Street,
the influence of his dream having been to fill his soul
with a more profound terror than he had ever before
experienced from the worst of sleep’s delusions.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;even at this moment you are abstracted&mdash;your
ideas are unsettled&mdash;and there is a wildness in
your looks which terrifies me!” cried Mr. Hatfield,
speaking with strong emphasis and in an earnest
manner. “Charles! again I implore you to tell me
the cause of this change which has so lately come over
you!”</p>

<p>“Dear father, why will you press me on the subject?”
cried the young man, now brought to himself,
yet knowing not how to reply. “Oh! believe me&mdash;believe
me, it will be better for us both that you do
not persist in questioning me!”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Charles,” returned Mr. Hatfield,
speaking more seriously and firmly than before, “it
will be far more satisfactory to me&mdash;yes, and to your
mother also&mdash;to be made the depositors of your secret
cares. You have assured me that you are not unhappy
on account of the discovery made on the day when
the Prince of Montoni was received at Court; and
therefore I must conjecture the existence of some
other cause of grief. Charles, my dear boy,” added
his father, gazing steadfastly upon him, “you love
Lady Frances&mdash;and you are fearful of avowing your
passion?”</p>

<p>The young man had expected that his father was
about to speak on some of those family matters into
the mysterious depths of which he had penetrated;
and, therefore, when Mr. Hatfield addressed to him
that species of interrogative accusation, Charles experienced
a relief which betrayed itself as well in the
brightening up of his countenance as in the surprise
wherewith he regarded his parent.</p>

<p>“Ah! now I have penetrated your secret!” cried
the latter: then, wringing his son’s hand, he said impressively,
“Fear nothing&mdash;but hope every thing,
Charles;&mdash;and if you have reason to believe that
Lady Frances reciprocates your attachment, hesitate
not to offer her your hand.”</p>

<p>With these words, Mr. Hatfield hurried from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
room, leaving his son amazed and bewildered at the
turn which the scene had so unexpectedly taken.</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed the young man aloud, after a
long pause, during which he reflected profoundly
alike on his fearful dream and his father’s suggestion;
“I will banish Perdita from my memory&mdash;for that
vision was a providential warning! The most deadly
serpents often wear the most beauteous skins;&mdash;and
Perdita&mdash;the syren Perdita&mdash;has secret ends of her
own to serve in thus throwing her silken chains round
me. There is mischief in her fascination:&mdash;the honey
of her lips will turn to gall and bitterness in the
mouth of him who presses them! And Frances&mdash;my
charming cousin Frances, who knows not that she is
thus related to me,&mdash;sweet Lady Frances is endowed
with every quality calculated to ensure my happiness.
Yes&mdash;I will adopt my father’s counsel: I will secure
the hand of this amiable girl! Then, although I
must sooner or later compel my sire to wrest the earldom
from his younger brother, the blow will fall the
less severely on the latter, inasmuch as his daughter
will become a Viscountess in espousing me, and a
Countess at my father’s death!”</p>

<p>Thus reasoned Charles Hatfield, as he performed
the duties of the toilette; and when he descended to
the breakfast-parlour, there was so fine a glow of animation
on his countenance, and so much happiness in
his bright eyes, that his parents were rejoiced to mark
the change. They did not, however, make any audible
observation on the subject; but the rapid and significant
glances which they dealt at each other, expressed
the delight that filled their souls.</p>

<p>Lady Frances looked more than usually beautiful
and interesting on this occasion: at least so thought
Charles Hatfield, as, seating himself by her side,
he ministered to her the attentions of the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>The conversation turned upon an important event
which was to take place in the evening&mdash;the Prince of
Montoni having accepted the Earl of Ellingham’s
invitation to a banquet at the lordly mansion in Pall
Mall. It was resolved, in order to render befitting
honour to the illustrious guest, that the entertainment
should be of the most sumptuous description; and no
expense was to be spared on the occasion. A select
number of the noble Earl’s acquaintances were invited;
and these were chosen not on account of great names
and sounding titles,&mdash;but on the score of personal
merit and consideration.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast Charles Hatfield and Lady
Frances found themselves alone together in the apartment;
and the young maiden, approaching her companion,
said in her artless, fascinating manner, “I am
delighted to see that you have recovered your natural
gaiety. Do you know, Mr. Charles, that you have
latterly been most desperately moody and reserved?”</p>

<p>“Not towards you, I hope, dear Fanny,” he replied.
“Not for worlds,” he added emphatically, “would I
give you cause to think ill of me.”</p>

<p>“As for thinking ill of you, Charles,” she observed,
“<em>that</em> would be impossible! But may I not seek to
know the reasons of your late unhappiness?”</p>

<p>“Let us not discourse upon the past, Fanny,” said
the young man, earnestly. “I am happy now, at all
events&mdash;happier, too, than ever, because I perceive
that my welfare is not altogether indifferent to you.”</p>

<p>“Far from it,” observed Lady Frances, with the ingenuous
emphasis of her extreme artlessness. “Do we
not live beneath the same roof?&mdash;are we not friends?&mdash;are
not our parents very dear friends to each other?&mdash;and
is it not therefore natural that I should feel interested
in all that concerns your happiness?”</p>

<p>“Adorable creature!” exclaimed Charles, as he drew
a rapid contrast between the charming <em>naivet&eacute;</em> of the
beautiful Lady Frances and the forward, bold manner
of the voluptuously lovely Perdita: then, taking his
cousin’s hand, and gazing tenderly upon her innocent
countenance, he said, “Fanny, were our parents to
sanction our marriage, would you consent to be
mine?”</p>

<p>Lady Frances withdrew her hand hastily; and,
blushing deeply, she gazed for a few seconds in the
most unfeigned surprise on her companion.</p>

<p>“You are not offended with me?” asked Charles.
“I had hoped&mdash;I had flattered myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I am not offended with you,” returned
Fanny, now casting down her eyes and blushing even
more deeply than before: “but I fear&mdash;I tremble lest
I am doing wrong thus to listen to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A virtuous affection is no crime,” said the young
man, hastily. “And now, my dearest Frances, if you
feel that you <em>can</em> love me, I will at once declare to
your noble parents the attachment&mdash;the deep attachment
which I experience towards you.”</p>

<p>“Whatever my father and mother counsel, will become
a law for me,” answered Lady Frances, in a low
and tremulous tone, which convinced the suitor that
he was not indifferent to her.</p>

<p>Charles pressed her hand to his lips, and hurried
from the room with the intention of immediately seeking
the Earl of Ellingham; but in the passage he encountered
a domestic who gave him a note which had
just been left by a messenger. The address was in an
elegant female hand; and the word “Private” was
written in the corner. Charles hastened to his own
apartment, and read the note, the contents of which
ran as follow:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;Before you see my mother again,
I must have a few words with you in private. She is compelled
to visit her solicitor at mid-day, and will be absent for
at least two hours. I shall expect you as soon after twelve as
possible.</p>

<p class="author">
“PERDITA FITZHARDINGE.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>“No&mdash;I will not accept the invitation!” exclaimed
the young man, aloud: then, gazing again at the note,
he murmured, “What a charming hand-writing&mdash;and
how beautiful does her mystic and romantic name
appear upon paper! <em>Perdita!</em>&mdash;’tis a name which
possesses an irresistible attraction! But&mdash;oh! that
dream! And yet it was but a dream&mdash;and a very
silly dream, the more I contemplate it. Heavenly
warnings are not sent by such means; and Lady
Frances might as well have been the subject of the
vision as Perdita. What can she require with me?
She must have a few words with me in private before
I see her mother again. Then her mother expects and
intends to have an interview with me&mdash;and she must
therefore have certain communications to make, after
all. This does not appear like delusion nor trickery:&mdash;no&mdash;the
old lady really has matters of import to
discuss with me;&mdash;and I should be wrong&mdash;I should
perhaps be criminally neglectful of my own interests,
were I not to hear whatever she may have to state.
And, Perdita&mdash;it would be at least rude and ungentlemanly
on my part not to attend to this missive, the
nature of which appears to be urgent. Yes&mdash;I will
call on Perdita: ’tis already verging close upon mid-day&mdash;and
there is no time to be lost. But&mdash;after all
that has passed between dear Frances and myself this
morning&mdash;I shall be as distant and reserved as politeness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
will admit: I shall arm myself against the fascinations
of the syren;&mdash;and if she offer to release me
from the pledge of friendship so inconsiderately given,
I shall not fail to accept with joy the proposed emancipation.”</p>

<p>But, before he repaired to Suffolk Street, did he not
seek his father to communicate to him the important
fact that he had duly followed his counsel and solicited
the hand of Lady Frances?&mdash;or did he not obtain an
interview with the Earl and acquaint him with the
nature of the conversation which had taken place
between himself and that nobleman’s daughter?</p>

<p>Alas! no:&mdash;for it was close upon twelve when the
young man received Perdita’s note;&mdash;and he thought
that it did not precisely signify for an hour or two
when he might make those statements; whereas it
was necessary to see the syren without delay.</p>

<p>Thus reasoned Charles Hatfield to himself;&mdash;and
the reader will agree with us in deciding that the
necessity which constituted the excuse for his conduct,
was not quite so urgent as he chose to fancy it.</p>

<p>Moreover,&mdash;since Charles Hatfield resolved to appear
as reserved and formal as he well might be, towards
Perdita,&mdash;it was assuredly strange that he should
devote more than usual attention to his toilette,
arranging his hair in the most becoming style, and
surveying with inward satisfaction his very handsome
countenance in the mirror.</p>

<p>The clock struck twelve as he quitted the house;&mdash;and
it was impossible to conceal from himself the fact
that he was rejoiced at having an excuse to call upon
Perdita.</p>

<p>Then, as he proceeded with some degree of rapidity
towards Suffolk Street, he could not possibly prevent
his imagination from indulging in exciting conjectures
how Perdita would be dressed&mdash;how she would look
by day-light&mdash;and how she would receive him when
she observed his studied coolness and his constraint of
manner.</p>

<p>“Poor girl!” he murmured to himself: “if she
really hoped to find a sincere friend in me, how will
she bear the disappointment which is in store for her?
It grieves me&mdash;Oh! it grieves me to be compelled to
inflict a wound upon her gentle heart; but duty&mdash;yes,
my duty towards Lady Frances leaves me no alternative.”</p>

<p>With a beating heart he knocked at the door;&mdash;and
in less than a minute he was conducted to the drawing-room,
where Perdita was waiting to receive him.</p>

<p>The young lady was dressed in an elegant morning
wrapper; and, the weather being intensely hot, the
ribbands which should have fastened it round her
neck, were left untied, so that it remained open at the
bosom. Her hair was arranged in bands, and she
wore a cap of the slightest material, but the snowy
whiteness of which enhanced the glossy richness of
those luxuriant masses that crowned her fine forehead.
Her large grey eyes, with their dark pupils,
were as bright and lustrous as on the preceding evening;
and the noon-day sun detracted not from the
exquisite whiteness of the neck and shoulders, and the
healthy hues of the complexion of the countenance,
which had shone to such advantage by candle-light.</p>

<p>No: Perdita was as ravishingly beautiful on this
occasion, as on the former;&mdash;and there was a freshness&mdash;yes,
even an appearance of virgin freshness, about
her, matured and developed as her charms were, which
counteracted the impression that her wanton looks and
the forwardness of her manner might otherwise have
created in respect to her virtue. Her depravity in
Australia had not impaired her loveliness, nor marred
the youthfulness of her beauty: her face&mdash;her figure
afforded not an intimation that she had been steeped in
licentious enjoyments from the age of thirteen until
she embarked on board the ship that wafted her to
England.</p>

<p>The moment Charles Hatfield entered the room, he
was struck by the enchanting loveliness of Perdita as
much as he had been on the preceding evening&mdash;indeed,
as completely as if this were the first time that
he had ever seen her. For an instant he stopped
short as if he dared not proceed farther within the
sphere of that Circean influence which a warning voice
within his soul seemed to declare was alluring him on
to total destruction but, fascinated as is the tremulous
bird by the eye of the serpent, he advanced towards
the beautiful creature who rose from the sofa to receive
him.</p>

<p>Then as he felt her warm hand in his,&mdash;as her countenance
beamed upon him in all the glory of its loveliness,&mdash;as
her soft, musical, and delicious voice flowed
upon his ear, borne on a breath fragrant as the perfume
of flowers, and issuing from lips that seemed to
have robbed the rose of its tint,&mdash;he felt his stern resolves
thawing within him, and experienced the impossibility
of manifesting coolness towards a creature
of such exquisite charms and such rare fascinations.</p>

<p>“I thank you, my dear friend, for this punctuality,”
she said, gently drawing him to a seat by her side on
the sofa, when she resumed her place. “Have you
thought of all that passed between us last evening?&mdash;and
have you reflected that we played the part of silly
children in pledging eternal friendship, total strangers
as we were to each other?&mdash;or did you regard the
proceeding as a natural and solemn compact, to be
inviolably maintained?”</p>

<p>“Wherefore these questions, Perdita?” enquired
Charles, dazzled by the impassioned looks that were
fixed upon him. “Have you yourself repented&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I never repent of any thing that I may do,” answered
Perdita, hastily. “I do nothing without being
convinced beforehand that I am acting judiciously
and properly; and when I most appear to be the child
of impulse, I am on those occasions the most considerate,
cautious, and reflective. But this may not
be the case with you: and, therefore, it was incumbent
upon me to ascertain your feeling in respect&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In respect to that friendship which I have sworn!”
exclaimed Charles, no longer master of himself. “Not
for world’s would I recall the pledge I gave&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then we are friends&mdash;friends in the manner I had
hoped we should be,” said the young woman. “But
it was necessary that I should be assured of this
before I spoke to you on a subject which otherwise
would have been indifferent to you,” she added, bending
on her companion a look that seemed to invite
him to kiss the red, pouting lips which, now parting
with a delicious smile, revealed her somewhat large,
but pearly, even, and admirably shaped teeth.</p>

<p>“Proceed, my dearest&mdash;dearest friend,” exclaimed
Charles, no longer thinking of Lady Frances, but
totally absorbed in the fascination which attracted
him towards the bewitching Perdita.</p>

<p>“You call me your friend&mdash;and it is as a friend that
I wish to consult you, Charles,” said the young woman,
heaving a deep sigh. “You must know that,
singular being that I may appear to you, and even
unmaidenly hasty in forming so sincere a friendship&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no: you obeyed the dictates of a generous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
heart&mdash;a heart as ingenuous and innocent as it is
fervid and warm,” cried Charles, seizing one of her
hands and pressing it in both his own.</p>

<p>“Ah! now you comprehend my sentiments just as
I would have explained them had I been able to
find language for the purpose!” she said, abandoning
her hand to him as if unwittingly. “But, as I was
about to observe, I am all candour and frankness:&mdash;that
is my deposition;&mdash;and when you left me last
evening, I immediately hastened to my mother, who
was seized with a sudden indisposition which prevented
her from joining us in this room; and to her
I revealed at once and unhesitatingly every word of
the conversation that had occurred between you and
me.”</p>

<p>“And she doubtless reproached you for opening
your heart so freely to one who was a complete
stranger to you?” said Charles, now fearful lest Mrs.
Fitzhardinge should forbid his visits to Perdita in
future.</p>

<p>“She reproached me indeed&mdash;but mildly and
blandly,” answered the deceitful young woman, assuming
a plaintive tone; “and yet not so mildly as
was her wont on former occasions&mdash;for it appears
that she has formed certain views in regard to me&mdash;views
of marriage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Marriage, Perdita!” repeated Charles Hatfield,
bitterly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she responded, her voice growing more
mournful still. “A man of immense wealth&mdash;and
with a noble title, but whose name I do not even yet
know, and whom I have never seen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! this is infamous, thus to dispose of you to a
person whom perhaps you may never be able to love!”
cried Charles, with strange emphasis and excitement
of manner.</p>

<p>“Love! I shall hate and abhor him, even though
he be handsome and amiable beyond all conception,”
exclaimed Perdita. “I shall detest him for the mere
fact that I am compelled to espouse him.”</p>

<p>“But will you yield with docility to an arrangement
which seems to me&mdash;pardon the freedom with
which I speak of your mother&mdash;to be indelicate and
unjust?” demanded the young man.</p>

<p>“Alas! I fear that I have no alternative save to
yield with as good a grace as I can assume,” answered
Perdita, tears now starting to her eyes, and trembling
on her long dark lashes; “for the nobleman whom
my mother would thus force me to wed, is her opponent
in the law-suit&mdash;and he has discovered a means
of establishing his claims beyond all possibility of
farther dispute.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I understand the dreadful selfishness that is
now at work in respect to you!” cried Charles. “He
will allow your mother to enjoy the fortune, provided
you are immolated&mdash;sacrificed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes: those are the terms;&mdash;and now you may
easily comprehend how I shrink from such a fate!”
exclaimed the young woman, sobbing profoundly.</p>

<p>“But this nobleman&mdash;who is he? what is his
name?” demanded Hatfield, powerfully excited.</p>

<p>“I know so little of my mother’s private affairs,
that I am unable to answer the questions,” said Perdita.
“To speak candidly, she refused even to mention
the name or the age of this unknown suitor for my
hand: and therefore I apprehend the worst. Indeed,
from an observation which she inadvertently dropped,
I am convinced that he is old&mdash;very old&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you who are so young&mdash;and so beautiful!”
cried Charles Hatfield, gazing upon her with admiration&mdash;nay,
with adoration and enthusiastic worship.
“It were an infamy&mdash;a crime&mdash;a diabolical crime,
thus to sacrifice you!”</p>

<p>“Yet such is my mother’s intention,” murmured
Perdita; “and therefore was it that she reproached
me for vowing a permanent friendship with you.”</p>

<p>“Then Mrs. Fitzhardinge will immolate you on the
altar of selfishness&mdash;she will sell you for gold,&mdash;sell
you, perhaps, to an old man who may be hideous, and
who is certain to be loathsome to you?” exclaimed
Charles, speaking with all the rapidity of wild excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes:&mdash;and it was not until last night that I
was aware of the frightful arrangement which my
mother had thus made&mdash;the dreadful compact to
which she had assented. It seems that this nobleman
had heard of me&mdash;and the description given of my
appearance pleased him; so that when he yesterday
discovered the existence of some paper which at once
annihilated all my mother’s previously conceived
hopes of gaining the law-suit, he promised his hateful
conditions.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Fitzhardinge has now sought her attorney&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For the purpose of declaring that I assent to this
most unnatural union!” added Perdita, with the well-feigned
emphasis of violent sorrow.</p>

<p>“But was it possible that you could hold out to
your mother even the faintest prospect of thus sacrificing
all your happiness suddenly and in a moment?”
demanded Charles.</p>

<p>“When I beheld my mother weep&mdash;heard her implore
and beseech&mdash;and was made aware of the ruin
that threatened her unless I agreed to the proposals
of this unknown suitor, I wept also&mdash;and, my tears
choking me, my silence was taken for assent. Then
my mother departed to visit her solicitor: and in my
despair I despatched a note to you, praying you to call
on me during her absence.”</p>

<p>“My God! what counsel&mdash;what advice can I give
you?” exclaimed Charles, bewildered by the tale
which was told so plausibly that not a doubt of its
truth existed in his mind. “I cannot see you sacrificed
thus:&mdash;yet how can I save you? Oh! were I
possessed of a fortune, I would bestow it upon your
mother that she might leave you free and unshackled
to obey only the dictates of your own will&mdash;follow your
own inclinations&mdash;and bestow your hand where you
could likewise grant your affections!”</p>

<p>“Ah! my generous friend,” murmured Perdita, advancing
her countenance towards his own as if unwittingly
and in the excitement of her feelings: “how
deeply grateful to you am I for these assurances! I
knew that I should receive your sympathy&mdash;if not your
aid,&mdash;your commiseration&mdash;if not your assistance.”</p>

<p>“How can I assist you, dearest Perdita?” exclaimed
Charles, pressing her hand violently in his own. “The
liberality of my pa&mdash;&mdash;my uncle and aunt, I mean&mdash;have
enabled me to accumulate some seven or eight
hundred pounds&mdash;for my allowance is far more liberal
than my expenditure: and that amount is at your
mother’s service. But it is so small&mdash;so contemptibly
small in comparison with the fortune which she doubtless
hopes to acquire&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it may procure a delay, by rescuing
my mother from the immediate embarrassments in
which this sudden change in the aspect of her affairs
has plunged her,” said Perdita: “for, to speak candidly
to you, her solicitor has been advancing her a
regular income during the time that the suit has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
lasted;&mdash;and now, since all hope of gaining it is destroyed,
no farther supplies can be expected from that
quarter.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it may procure a delay,” said Charles, in a
musing tone; “and with leisure to reflect calmly&mdash;deliberately&mdash;much
may be done! O Perdita&mdash;never,
never could I see you thus sacrificed to a man whom
you would abhor!”</p>

<p>“Generous friend&mdash;’twas heaven who sent you to
me!” exclaimed the young woman, drooping her head
upon his breast, and weeping,&mdash;weeping tears of gratitude,
as he fondly believed.</p>

<p>He threw his arms around her&mdash;he pressed her to
his heart&mdash;he clasped her with such fervour that the
embrace was passionately violent&mdash;he strained her as
it were to the seat of his very soul: then, hastily
loosening his hold, he raised her face&mdash;her warm,
blushing face&mdash;and on her lips he imprinted a thousand
rapturous kisses,&mdash;those lips that were literally
glued to his own. He looked into her eyes, and read
love, desire, and passion in those orbs, now melting
with languor and wantonness;&mdash;for Perdita herself
had almost entirely lost all power of self-controul, and
clung to him as if inviting the full extreme of voluptuous
enjoyment. He felt her bosom heaving against
his chest; and, maddened with excitement, his daring
hand invaded the treasures of those swelling, palpitating
globes, so snowy in their whiteness&mdash;so warm with
their licentious fires.</p>

<p>But at that instant Perdita recovered her presence
of mind: and it flashed to her memory that it was no
part of her scheme to surrender herself completely up
to him until she had ensnared his affections so fully&mdash;so
inextricably, that all subsequent escape or estrangement,
through repentance and remorse, should be impossible.</p>

<p>Accordingly&mdash;wresting herself from his embrace,
and retreating to the farther end of the sofa, she hastily
arranged her cap and dishevelled hair&mdash;drew the
wrapper over her breast&mdash;and, turning upon him eyes
that still seemed to swim in liquid languor, said in a
half-reproachful manner, “Oh! Charles&mdash;is this friendship?
would you ruin me?”</p>

<p>“Sweetest&mdash;dearest creature,” exclaimed the young
man, “did I not tell you yester-night that <em>friendship</em>
was a sentiment dangerous for us to feel, and a word
perilous for our tongues to utter? O Perdita&mdash;it is
not friendship that I feel for you: ’tis love&mdash;ardent,
sincere, and devoted love! And ’twas not friendship
at first sight that I experienced for you the moment I
last evening set foot in this room: but ’twas love&mdash;love,
my Perdita&mdash;such love as never before did man
entertain for woman!”</p>

<p>“And it was because I love you, Charles,” murmured
Perdita, in her softest, tenderest tones, “that I
loathe and abhor the idea of that union which my
mother has so inconsiderately&mdash;so rashly&mdash;so cruelly
planned for me!”</p>

<p>“You love me, Perdita!” ejaculated the young man,
wild with joy: “oh! thanks&mdash;ten thousand thanks for
that assurance, my own sweet Perdita! I was happy
in the possession of your friendship: but I am now
mad&mdash;demented in the confidence of owning your love!
For the love of such a being as yourself is something
that would make a paradise of the blackest and most
barren desert on the face of the earth! Is it possible,
then, that I possess your love, Perdita&mdash;dearest Perdita?
Oh! tell me so once more: it is so delicious to
hear such an avowal from your lips!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Charles&mdash;I love you&mdash;I do indeed love you,”
replied the young woman, throwing as much softness
into her melting tones, as much witchery into her
manner, and as much voluptuous languor into her
glances as she possibly could.</p>

<p>It was like a scene of enchantment for that young
man of wild and fervid impulses; and he was completely&mdash;wholly
absorbed in its magic interest,&mdash;an
interest so enthralling, so captivating that he felt as if he
had been suddenly wafted into a new world of delights
unknown in this sublunary sphere. Lady Frances
was forgotten&mdash;his parents, his ambitious aims, and
even his admiration of the Prince of Montoni,&mdash;all, all
were forgotten in the delirium of passion which had
seized upon him.</p>

<p>“You love me&mdash;you do indeed love me!” he exclaimed;
and, approaching the object of his worship,
he again wound his arms around her&mdash;again drank in
the sweetness of her moist red lips.</p>

<p>“Charles&mdash;Charles,” she murmured; “you are gloriously
handsome&mdash;and I adore you!”</p>

<p>But as she thus spoke, she once more disengaged herself
from his maddened embrace&mdash;for she felt that her
own passions, ever violent, were raging to a degree that
became almost uncontroullable.</p>

<p>“And now listen to me&mdash;patiently and tranquilly if
you can; and I will lay down the conditions on which
our complete happiness may be based,&mdash;conditions
which have for their elements that generous confidence,
that mutual reliance, and that candour and
frankness which alone constitute pure affection.”</p>

<p>“Proceed, dearest Perdita,” said Hatfield: “I am
all attention&mdash;and your voice is sweeter in my ears
than the most delicious music.”</p>

<p>Perdita once more arranged her cap and the massive
bands of her glossy hair: then, turning with a simulation
of charming artlessness towards her companion,
she addressed him in the following manner.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXII">CHAPTER CXXXII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE DANGEROUS SOPHISTRY OF A LOVELY WOMAN.</span></h2>

<p>“You are now about to discover a new phasis in my
character, dear Charles; and perhaps you will look
upon my notions and opinions as unmaidenly and
bold&mdash;if not positively immoral. But remember that
I am not like the generality of my sex; and that my
sentiments, though audacious as innovations, are nevertheless
as sincerely believed in as they are tenaciously
clung to by me.”</p>

<p>“It is because you are so different from other
women, not only in the loveliness of your person, but
also in the tone and strength of your mind,” said
Charles, “that I am thus enamoured of you&mdash;yes, and
proud too of possessing your affection in return.”</p>

<p>“But I am about to preach a doctrine which you
may think repugnant to the befitting delicacy of my
sex,” returned Perdita: “for it is of the uselessness of
the marriage rites that I have now to discourse.”</p>

<p>“Proceed, dearest,” said Charles; “and I will
frankly give you my opinion on your views in this
respect.”</p>

<p>“Ah! now you encourage me to open my heart to
you, my dear friend,” exclaimed Perdita; “and you
do not affect the sanctimonious hypocrite, who frowns
even before he has heard the argument broached.
Thus stands our present position in my estimation:&mdash;We
love each other&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>“Devotedly&mdash;earnestly,” added Charles, with strong
emphasis, the image of Lady Frances being as completely
banished from his mind as if such a person as
that charming creature did not exist in the world.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;we love each other devotedly and earnestly,”
continued Perdita; “and the extent as well as the
ardour of our passion is a something which should
remain a solemn and sacred mystery to the vulgar and
curious observer. ’Tis a secret which we should
cherish between ourselves,&mdash;a secret whose charm is
spoilt, or at all events marred, by being revealed
to others who are indifferent to us. This is one
reason wherefore I consider the pompous ceremony of
marriage to be actually detrimental to the fervid,
ardent, and warm attachment which seeks to hide
itself in the bosoms of the fond couple who entertain
it. Then, again, I should not be happy were I to
have the conviction that I was so enchained to you by
legal trammels that you could not cast me off did I
become displeasing to you;&mdash;for I should never know
whether you still clung to me through the endurance
of real affection, or because an indissoluble bond forged
by human legislation united us. No:&mdash;I would rather
that our love rested upon its own basis alone&mdash;existing
by its own vitality, and through no borrowed and artificial
auxiliary,&mdash;that it should be a mutual confidence&mdash;a
mutual reliance,&mdash;free and independent in one
sense, and compulsory in none. If on these terms you
will take thy Perdita to thine arms, Charles&mdash;then indeed
shall I gladly become thine:&mdash;but if our union
must be characterised by solemn ceremonies and cold,
inanimate rites&mdash;then, heartbreaking as the alternative
will be, I can never&mdash;never be more to thee than a
sincere and faithful friend.”</p>

<p>“Dearest Perdita,” exclaimed Charles, “I receive
all these confessions of your peculiar sentiments as
new proofs of your love for me! For by the very
nature of the conditions which you stipulate, you convince
me of the trust which you repose in my fidelity
and honour.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;because in defiance of the opinion of the
world, I surrender myself up to you, to be a wife in
every thing save in respect to that ceremony which is
the first object of a virtuous woman’s thoughts,” murmured
Perdita. “And now, dear Charles, do you entertain
a mean opinion of my principles, because I dare
to chalk out a path of happiness according to my own
fancy?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no. Perdita!” cried the young man, pressing
to his lips the hand which was extended to him with
such an appearance of ingenuousness that it quite enchanted
him. “But how is it possible that you&mdash;so
young&mdash;should have pondered so seriously on the subject
of love and of marriage? For you have assured
me that you never loved till now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Though nineteen summers have not yet passed
over my head,” interrupted Perdita, “my mind has
travelled much in the realms of thought and meditation;&mdash;and
though, as I will candidly confess to you,
I have read but little, yet have I pondered much.”</p>

<p>“And there is about you a mystery as charming
and as interesting as your loveliness is indescribably
great,” said Charles: “and you know, angel that you
are, how I adore you!”</p>

<p>“Then if we plight our faith to each other to-day,
as solemnly and as emphatically as yester-night we
vowed an eternal friendship, shall you ever repent the
step you will have taken?” asked Perdita, gazing affectionately
on her handsome companion, whose looks
seemed to devour her.</p>

<p>“Repent!&mdash;what, repent the step that makes you
mine?” he exclaimed. “No&mdash;never, never!”</p>

<p>“And you take me as your wife on the conditions
I have named&mdash;that I am to be a wife, and no wife?”
said Perdita, her musical voice sounding soft as a
silver bell and tremulously clear,&mdash;ravishment in her
tone, love in her eyes, and warmth in the tender
pressure of the hand which the young man had
grasped.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I take you as my wife on those conditions,”
he returned, pressing her to his bosom. “But there
are still many things to be considered, my Perdita,”
he observed, after a short pause, during which they
exchanged the most rapturous kisses. “In the first
place, your mother&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall boldly acquaint her with what I have
done,” said Perdita; “and she will not seal my unhappiness
by an opposition&mdash;which, after all, would be
vain and useless,” added the syren.</p>

<p>“And will not Mrs. Fitzhardinge recoil in horror
from the idea that her daughter should have formed
this connexion, without bearing the legal name of a
wife?” demanded Charles, gazing earnestly on her
beautiful countenance.</p>

<p>“Leave me to make my mother a convert to my
own principles respecting marriage,” was the reply.
“And now, with regard to yourself, my Charles,&mdash;you
need be under no restraint. Continue to dwell with
your family&mdash;and visit me as frequently as you can.
In fact, I shall of course expect you to pass as much
of your time as possible with me,&mdash;but never when
your relatives and friends require your presence.”</p>

<p>“Oh! on these terms we shall indeed be supremely
happy!” cried Charles. “And now you are my
wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and you are my husband,” blushingly answered
the syren, as she drooped her head upon his
breast.</p>

<p>He wound his arms around her; and then their lips
met in warm and luscious kisses. Charles grew bolder:
his hand wandered to Perdita’s glowing bosom,&mdash;and
Perdita no longer restrained him&mdash;no longer shrank
back. Still, however, she did not choose to surrender
herself immediately: a little more tantalization would
only rivet his enthusiastic attachment and confirm the
madness of his devouring passion;&mdash;and, accordingly&mdash;at
the moment when, wild with desire, he was about
to claim the privilege of a husband, she started from
his arms, exclaiming, “Hush! my mother has returned&mdash;I
hear her approaching!”</p>

<p>They separated&mdash;retreating to the ends of the sofa;
and Perdita arranged her disordered hair once more.</p>

<p>No one however came: it was a false alarm,&mdash;as
Perdita indeed well knew it to be.</p>

<p>“You must leave me now, Charles,” she said; “for
my mother cannot be long ere she comes back. To-morrow,
at mid-day, I shall be again alone&mdash;for I am
aware that she will have to pay another visit to her
attorney. Come, then, at that hour&mdash;and I will tell
you all that has passed between my parent and myself.”</p>

<p>“Not an instant later than twelve to-morrow shall I
be!” exclaimed Charles. “And now,&mdash;forgive me for
returning for a moment to worldly affairs&mdash;quitting the
paradise of happiness to which you have raised me,
my Perdita,&mdash;but in respect to the small sum&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! I had forgotten all our arrangements with
regard to that matter,” said Perdita: “and, indeed&mdash;I
detest and abominate money-affairs. But now&mdash;as
your wife, dearest Charles&mdash;I may mention my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
wishes on that head without a blush. I should therefore
be pleased if you could forward the amount to me
in the course of the afternoon; and I will use it to the
best possible advantage with my mother.”</p>

<p>“In less than an hour it shall be here in an envelope,
sealed, and addressed to yourself,” said Charles.
“Farewell, my sweet Perdita&mdash;farewell, until to-morrow!”</p>

<p>They embraced each other fervently; and Charles
Hatfield took his departure.</p>

<p>Before he returned home, he walked into the park
to collect his scattered thoughts and acquire some
degree of composure. His perfidy&mdash;his infamous
treachery towards Lady Frances now burst upon him
in all its hideousness. That very morning had he
demanded his cousin’s hand in marriage;&mdash;and within
an hour afterwards he had solemnly contracted a
strange and scarcely comprehensible union with Perdita
Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>His conduct seemed vile in the extreme: his heart,
smote him painfully.</p>

<p>Yet was he so completely infatuated with Perdita,
that he could not calmly contemplate the idea of breaking
with her for ever. He was like a gambler who
loathes himself for his ready yielding to a ruinous vice&mdash;but
who nevertheless returns with renewed zest to
the gaming-table.</p>

<p>For Charles thought of the happiness which he had
so nearly attained on this eventful day, and which he
felt assured must await him on the morrow:&mdash;he
could not banish from his imagination the recollection
of those charms which had plunged him into a perfect
delirium of passion;&mdash;and the more he thought on the
witching loveliness of Perdita, the less inclined was he
to resign her.</p>

<p>Then came the almost inevitable results of the
sophistry which the designing woman had called to
her aid,&mdash;results which may be explained the more
completely by following the current of the young man’s
thoughts.</p>

<p>“After all, I am not indissolubly bound to Perdita&mdash;nor
has she for ever linked her destiny with mine. No
marriage ceremony has taken place between us&mdash;nor
will any. I am not inextricably fastened to her apron-strings.
And yet&mdash;and yet, is it honourable of me
to make such calculations, the inferences to be drawn
from which I am ashamed even to express to my own
secret self? No&mdash;no: because no legal ties exist between
us, I am the more imperiously bound to remain
faithfully attached to her! Beautiful&mdash;enchanting&mdash;mysterious
Perdita, how hast thou enthralled me!
But&mdash;my God! am I not your willing slave?&mdash;do I
not accept the yoke which thou hast thrown upon me?&mdash;would
I release myself from those silken chains,
even were I able? No&mdash;ten thousand times <em>no</em>, my
adored&mdash;my worshipped Perdita! I care not whether
thou dost exercise a supernatural enchantment over
me: if thou art Satan in a female shape&mdash;or a serpent,
as my dream appeared to give warning&mdash;I cannot
cease to love thee,&mdash;no&mdash;never&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>But what of Lady Frances Ellingham? Oh! it was
rash&mdash;it was indiscreet of him to solicit her hand;&mdash;but
had he not acted in pursuance of the advice of his
father?&mdash;and had he gone so far as to be unable to
retreat?</p>

<p>Alas! Charles Hatfield, the sophistry of Perdita
has rendered thee sophistical, until thou dost stand on
the very threshold of&mdash;villainy!</p>

<p>Reckless art thou of the whisperings of conscience:&mdash;thou
art infatuated with the fatal beauty of thy
Perdita&mdash;and the hope, the burning hope of tasting in
her arms the pleasures of paradise, renders thee studious
only to subdue the remorse that whispers to thee
the name of the outraged Lady Frances Ellingham!</p>

<p>Having wandered in the park for upwards of half
an hour, Charles Hatfield bethought himself of the
promise to send the amount of his savings to his
beauteous Perdita; and, hastening home, he sought
his chamber, which he reached unperceived by any
one save the domestic who gave him admission. That
he was thus unobserved, was a source of satisfaction,&mdash;inasmuch
as he felt that his cheeks were flushed,
and he feared lest his appearance might seem singular.</p>

<p>Opening his desk he took from a secret drawer the
Bank-notes which constituted his savings; and enveloping
them in a sheet of paper, he issued forth again
to leave the parcel at the house in Suffolk Street.
This being done, Charles returned to the park, where
he roamed about until the hour arrived when it was
necessary for him to return home in order to dress for
dinner.</p>

<p>The reader must not forget that a splendid banquet
was to take place that evening at the mansion of the
Earl of Ellingham,&mdash;a banquet given in honour of the
Prince of Montoni, and at which his Royal Highness
was to be present.</p>

<p>As the hour approached, Charles Hatfield felt his
heart beat; and all his admiration of the illustrious
hero revived;&mdash;so that his mind was labouring under
no inconsiderable degree of excitement, as he thought
of Perdita on the one hand&mdash;the Prince on the other&mdash;and
also of Lady Frances Ellingham!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXIII">CHAPTER CXXXIII.<br />

<span class="medium">A THRONE SURROUNDED BY REPUBLICAN
INSTITUTIONS.</span></h2>

<p>The entertainment was of the most splendid description&mdash;worthy
of the hospitality and taste of the noble
host and hostess.</p>

<p>The Prince of Montoni was dressed in plain clothes:
but on his breast gleamed the star denoting his rank;
and on his left leg he wore the English Garter, his
Royal Highness having been admitted on the previous
day a member of that illustrious Order.</p>

<p>He was seated on the right of the Countess of
Ellingham, Lady Frances being next to him, and
Charles Hatfield occupying the place immediately following.
In addition to these personages and the Earl
of Ellingham, Mr. Hatfield, and Lady Georgiana
there were Sir John Lascelles, Clarence Villiers and
Adelais, and the select few who had been invited to
the banquet on this occasion.</p>

<p>The Prince was naturally of a modest and unassuming
disposition,&mdash;though endowed with ample
dignity to maintain his lofty rank and honourably
fill his high position,&mdash;yet bearing himself so condescendingly
and affably, that every one felt completely
at ease in his presence. Even Sir John Lascelles, who
had grown somewhat morose, and difficult to please in
his old age, was quite delighted with the youthful
hero, whose conversation was characterised by so
much sound sense and such a total absence of obtrusiveness.</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield was delighted at the thought of
being once more in company with the object of his
worship; and he seemed to hang upon every word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
that fell from the lips of the Prince of Montoni, as if
he were listening to a demigod.</p>

<div id="i_089" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_089.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When the ladies had retired, the conversation
turned upon political matters; and the Earl of Ellingham
questioned the Prince relative to the condition of
the Castelcicalans, whom report, newspapers, and
books represented to be in the highest possible state
of civilisation prosperity, and happiness.</p>

<p>“His Sovereign Highness, my revered father-in-law,”
said the Prince, “has exerted himself in all
possible ways to render his people contented and
flourishing. The task may seem to be difficult for a
monarch to undertake; but it really is not so. Honourable,
upright, and liberal-minded Ministers are to be
found in all countries, if the sovereign have but the
discrimination to select them: indeed, a Chamber of
Deputies, rightly constituted, will be sure to indicate
the most efficient and trust-worthy men to whom the
responsibilities of government may be safely confided.
Every man in Castelcicala, having a habitation in
which he may be said to be settled,&mdash;no matter
whether it be a house of his own, or a mere lodging,&mdash;has
the right of suffrage. The elections take place by
ballot; and thus, considering that all save absolute
mendicants have the power of voting, and seeing likewise
the immense number of voters that there are,
bribery is almost impossible. But to ensure, as much
as mortal means can, the purity of election, any attempt
at bribery or intimidation is counted a misdemeanor,
and is punished by a fine, imprisonment, and
the loss of civil rights for a period of seven years.
Under these circumstances our elections take place in
an orderly, quiet, and honest manner: the people conduct
themselves with propriety, because they recognise
the generous confidence reposed in them by their sovereign,
and endeavour to render themselves worthy of it.”</p>

<p>“When your Royal Highness liberated Castelcicala
and opened the way for the Grand Duke Alberto to
the throne,” said Sir John Lascelles, who had listened
attentively to the Prince’s observations, “the Castelcicalans
were in a state of abject slavery. Were these
boons of consummate freedom conferred upon them in
a moment?&mdash;and if so, were the people prepared in
any way to receive them?”</p>

<p>“A nation in slavery, Sir John,” answered the
Prince, “is like a body in a condition of deep disease.
Now, would you restore that body to perfect health all
in a moment, if you had the power?&mdash;or would you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
only effect the restoration by slow and almost imperceptible
degrees?”</p>

<p>“As a conscientious and an honest man, I should
of course adopt the mode of instantaneous cure,” replied
the physician.</p>

<p>“Then, Sir John, your question whether the Castelcicalans
were prepared to receive the consummation
of their freedom in a moment, is answered,” said the
Prince, smiling. “Believe me, those statesmen who
talk of the necessity of gradual reform are either weak
and timid, or else in their hearts opposed to the interests
of the people. Freedom is a nation’s right; and
a right cannot be recognised too suddenly nor too
frankly. Were your fortune in the grasp of a rapacious
monarch, should you be contented by receiving
it in small instalments according to his caprice and
good pleasure? No: certainly not! You would demand
and expect to receive the whole at once&mdash;and would consider
yourself the victim of a monstrous tyranny, were
your claims refused, or ridiculed, or set at naught.
Yes, Sir John&mdash;the Castelcicalans obtained in a moment,
as it were, their emancipation from tyranny and
oppression. Immediately after His Sovereign Highness
ascended the throne of that powerful State, he
promulgated a decree, not merely conceding universal
suffrage as a boon, but at once proclaiming it as the
recognised right of the people. He did not say, ‘<em>I
give it to you</em>:’ but he said, ‘<em>I do not for an instant
attempt to withhold it</em>.’ The people saw that they
were not treated as children, but as a free and enlightened
nation; and they generously proffered gratitude,
and testified their admiration and respect for
their monarch. The Chambers assembled in due time&mdash;both
Senators and Deputies being elected, and the
principle of an hereditary Peerage being totally eschewed.
Not even is the President of the Senate appointed
by the Grand Duke: he is chosen by his compeers,
as is the President of the Chamber of Deputies.
The Grand Duke pledged himself to retain in power
or to nominate only those Ministers whom the parliamentary
majority pointed out; and, accordingly, the
Cabinet which I had the honour to appoint during
the period when I exercised the functions of Regent,
immediately after the battle of Montoni, has remained
in office ever since that time&mdash;because it is supported
by the majority. There is an Opposition in both
Chambers,&mdash;an Opposition consisting of the Aristocracy
of the Old School, High Churchmen, and a few
very wealthy landowners; and indeed an Opposition
is necessary to all good government, because were
measures passed by universal acclamation, there would
be no sifting of all their details to the very bottom.
The Progressist Ministry in Castelcicala is therefore
rather thankful to the Opposition than otherwise;&mdash;but
the popular voice is entirely in favour of the
Ministerial party.”</p>

<p>“The Grand Duke is therefore almost a cypher in
Castelcicala?” observed Sir John Lascelles.</p>

<p>“Not so,” returned the Prince, mildly but firmly.
“There must be a chief magistrate&mdash;an executive&mdash;in
every State; and he is that chief magistrate. Do you
suppose that the task of discriminating and rewarding
merit,&mdash;in patronising the arts and sciences,&mdash;in raising
the humble but deserving individual,&mdash;and in performing
all the various services to a country which the
supreme ruler must ever have the opportunity of
doing,&mdash;do you not suppose, Sir John Lascelles, that
these are duties which render a good Prince any thing
but a cypher? It is true that Castelcicala has a
Throne: but it is surrounded by Republican Institutions;&mdash;and
it matters very little whether Alberto be
called President, Grand Duke, Emperor, or King.
There is nothing in the name of the office: all that
merits our attention is the extent of the privileges of
that office.”</p>

<p>“But the sovereignty of Castelcicala is hereditary,”
said Sir John Lascelles; “and yet your Royal Highness
is an opponent to the hereditary peerage. If the principle
be objectionable in the one case&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me for interrupting you, sir,” exclaimed
the Prince: “but you are arguing on a false premise.
The hereditary principle is abolished even in respect to
the sovereignty. Alberto voluntarily abdicated this
dynastic privilege; and one of his first acts was to
place his diadem at the disposal of the Chambers. He
told them that he was willing to obey the sovereign
will of the people. The Chambers confirmed him in
his high office; and of their own accord they honoured
me by naming me the heir-apparent to the throne.
But the hereditary principle is virtually annihilated;
because one generation cannot bind its successor; and
the law which thus appointed me as the heir-apparent,
may be repealed by a new Chamber. It is monstrous
to suppose that the hereditary principle can be tolerated
by a nation knowing its own power and appreciating
its own interests: for that principle may give
you a good sovereign to-day, and a tyrant, an idiot, or
a degraded sensualist to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I admit the force of your Royal Highness’s argument,”
said Lascelles; “and if I object, it is rather to
seek information on these subjects than to question the
excellence of the system of government introduced into
Castelcicala. I would now deferentially seek to learn
how far that system has benefitted the people of your
Highness’s adopted country?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, Sir John,” returned the Prince,
“the people have the elections entirely in their own hands,
and return to Parliament representatives who do not
buy their seats, but who are chosen on account of their
merits. At least, this observation applies to the great
majority of the Senators and Deputies. The elections
take place every two years; so that ample opportunity
is allowed the constituents of getting rid of persons who
may chance to deceive them or prove incapable; while
a sufficient space of time is afforded for giving the representatives
a fair trial. The result of these arrangements
is, that the majority of the representatives legislate
for the interests of the mass&mdash;and not of the few.
Good measures are the consequence; and the happiness
of the people is promoted, while civilisation progresses
rapidly, and the prosperity of the country increases
daily. My lord,” continued the Prince, turning
towards the Earl of Ellingham, “history has recorded
the memorable speech which your lordship delivered
nineteen years ago in the House of Lords&mdash;the
speech that first introduced your lordship to the world
as the generous defender, vindicator, and champion of
the People;&mdash;and it rejoices me unfeignedly to be
enabled to inform you, my noble friend&mdash;for so you will
permit me to call you&mdash;that the speech I allude to, and
all your subsequent orations on the same subject have
been studied, weighed, and debated upon in the Councils
of the Sovereign of Castelcicala.”</p>

<p>The Earl acknowledged the compliment in befitting
terms; and the Prince of Montoni continued in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To prove to your lordship that it is no idle flattery&mdash;of
which, indeed, I am incapable&mdash;that I am now addressing
to you, I will at once inform you that every
suggestion which your lordship’s first and grandest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
oration contained, has been carried out with complete
success in Castelcicala. Anticipating the pleasure of
being enabled this evening to give your lordship some
account of the condition of the Castelcicalans, I had
furnished myself with a copy of the memorable speech
to which I have already several times alluded; and I
will now explain in detail the results of your lordship’s
views, as exemplified in their application to the
Grand Duchy.”</p>

<p>The Prince produced a manuscript; and, spreading
it before him, his Royal Highness continued in the ensuing
terms,&mdash;addressing himself to a most attentive
and delighted audience:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your lordship stated that it was too frequently
alleged that the industrious classes are thoughtless,
improvident, ungrateful, and intellectually dull: but
this assertion you emphatically denied; and you proceeded
to reason thus:&mdash;‘Despair, produced by their
unhappy condition, naturally led to dissipation in
many instances; but were the working man placed
in a position so that his livelihood should be rendered
less precarious than it now was&mdash;were his labour adequately
remunerated&mdash;were he more fairly paid by
the representatives of property&mdash;were a scale of wages
established, having a fixed minimum, but no fixed
maximum, the increased comfort thus ensured to him
would naturally remove from his mind those cares
which drove him to the public-house.’&mdash;Well, my lord
and gentlemen,” continued the Prince, “the suggestion
has been adopted in Castelcicala: a fixed minimum
for wages has been established&mdash;the lowest
amount of payment ensuring a sum sufficient to
enable the working man to maintain himself and his
family in respectability. The results may almost be
said to have been instantaneous. Crime diminished
rapidly: statistical returns soon proved that intemperance
experienced a remarkable decrease; and such
was the falling off in the consumption of spirituous
liquors, beer, and tobacco, that the Government found
it necessary to grant a compensation to the licensed
victuallers, publicans, and tobacconists who suffered
by this change in the habits of the people. Even <em>employers</em>
speedily began to recognise the advantage of
the new state of things in the improved condition of
their <em>employed</em>, the increase and the excellence of
the labour they obtained, and the superiority of their
agriculture or their manufactures. No <em>maximum</em> of
wages has been fixed in Castelcicala; and when I left
the country a month ago, those wages were higher
than ever they were known to be before. The demand
for labour has greatly increased; and, though the
territory be densely populated, employment may be
found for all. If a man be now a pauper or mendicant
in Castelcicala, it must be either through physical infirmity,
or through his unwillingness to work. Of this
latter, however, we have comparatively few examples&mdash;emulation
and patriotism acting powerfully in a
country where so much happiness and such prosperity
prevail. Now, with a slight alteration in your lordship’s
speech, one of the most remarkable passages in that
speech reads thus when applied to Castelcicala:&mdash;‘There
is no fixed <em>maximum</em> of wages, because wages
are always to be increased in proportion to the value
of productive labour to employers: but there is a
<em>minimum</em> established, to obviate the cruel and disastrous
effects of those periods when labour exceeds
the demand in the market. This is not considered
unfair towards employers, because when the markets
are brisk and trade is flourishing, they (the employers)
reap the greatest benefit from that activity, and enrich
themselves in a very short time; therefore, when
markets are dull and trade is stagnant, they are still
compelled to pay such wages as enable their employed
to live comfortably. The profits gained during prosperous
seasons not only enable employers to enjoy
handsome incomes, but also to accumulate considerable
savings; and as the best wages scarcely enable the
employed to make any thing like an adequate provision
for periods of distress, it is not deemed fair that the
representatives of property should use the labour of the
working classes just when it suits them, and discard
it or only use it on a miserable recompense when it
does not so well suit them. For the labour of the
employed not only makes annual incomes for the employers,
but also permanent fortunes; and the value
of that labour is not calculated as lasting only just as
long as it is available for the purpose of producing
large profits. Labour is recognised in Castelcicala and
positively stated to be the working man’s <em>capital</em>, and
bears constant interest, as well as money placed in the
funds&mdash;that interest of course increasing in proportion
to the briskness of markets; but never depreciating
below a standard value&mdash;much less being discarded as
valueless altogether, in times of depression. A thousand
pounds always obtains three per cent. interest,
under any circumstances; and, at particular periods,
is worth six or seven per cent. Labour is considered
by the Castelcicalans in the same light. Stagnant
markets diminish the profits of employers, but do not
ruin them: if they do not obtain profit enough to live
upon, they have the accumulations of good seasons to
fall back upon. But how different used to be the case
with the employed! To them stagnation of business
was ruin&mdash;starvation&mdash;death;&mdash;the breaking up of
their little homes&mdash;the sudden check of their children’s
education&mdash;the cause of demoralisation and degradation&mdash;and
the necessity of applying to the parish!
All these terrible evils have been completely annihilated
by the system introduced into Castelcicala. The
supply and demand of labour are necessarily unequal
at many times, and in many districts; and the Government
has therefore adopted measures to prevent those
frightful fluctuations in wages which carry desolation
into the homes of thousands of hard-working, industrious,
and deserving families. In fact, a law has been
passed to ensure the working-man against the casualty
of being employed at a price below remuneration.’&mdash;Thus,
my lord, you perceive that so far your views
have been most successfully carried out: they are no
longer a theory&mdash;I have seen them reduced to positive
practice; and I pledge myself most solemnly and
sacredly to the admirable working of this enlightened
reformatory system.”</p>

<p>“Would that I could see my own fellow-countrymen
rendered thus happy&mdash;raised thus high in the
social sphere&mdash;and thus tenderly cared for by their
rulers!” exclaimed Lord Ellingham, in the impassioned
tone of the most earnest and heart-felt sincerity.</p>

<p>“The day must come,” observed the Prince of Montoni,
“when the English people will recognise all the
grand truths which you enunciated nineteen years ago
from your place in the House of Lords. And, if in
England you have failed to convince the aristocracy
and the landowners of the wickedness of the course
they are pursuing,&mdash;are not your labours in some
degree rewarded by the knowledge that your lordship’s
plans have been carried out to the very letter in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Grand Duchy of Castelcicala,&mdash;yes, and carried out
too with such unequivocal success?”</p>

<p>“The information which your Royal Highness now
imparts, gives me the most unfeigned pleasure,” said
the Earl. “I had indeed read and heard of the recent
grand improvements which had taken place in that
Italian State where there is a Throne surrounded by
Republican Institutions: but I was not aware&mdash;indeed,
the loftiest flights of vanity never could have suggested
to me that my views and theories had in any way
contributed to the prosperity of the <span class="smcap">Model State</span>, as
the Liberals in England now denominate Castelcicala.”</p>

<p>“To convince you, my lord, how far your ideas
have been applied to the elevation of Castelcicala to its
present proud eminence,” said the Prince, “I will again
refer to a passage in your lordship’s ever memorable
speech, and point a few contrasts. ‘In England the
poor are not allowed to have a stake in the country:’
I have shown you that the very reverse is the case in
the Grand Duchy. ‘In England there are no small
properties: the land is in the possession of a few individuals
comparatively; and thus the landed interest
constitutes a tremendous monopoly, most unjust and
oppressive to the industrious classes.’&mdash;In Castelcicala
the law of primogeniture is annihilated; there no man
can leave his estate solely to his eldest son; it must
be divided amongst all his male children equally,
a charge being fixed upon it for the support of his
daughters. Thus the territory is rapidly undergoing
a process of sub-division, which admits thousands to
the enjoyment of a real stake in the country, and
breaks down the tremendous monopoly of the landed
interest. In Castelcicala, moreover, ‘property is compelled
to maintain labour as long as labour seeks for
employment and occupation.’ What now, then, is
the condition of the Castelcicalan people? Being well
treated, rendered free, and having every possible
avenue opened to them for the attainment of real
property, ‘the working-classes are not driven by their
cares and troubles to the excessive use of alcoholic
liquors; they do not become demoralized by being
compelled to migrate from place to place in search of
employment&mdash;they are not forced to go upon the tramp,
sleeping in hideous dens of vice, where numbers are
forced to herd together without reference to age or sex:
they are not unsettled in all their little arrangements to
bring up their children creditably and with due reference
to instruction;&mdash;they are not made discontented,
anxious for any change no matter what, vindictive
towards a society which renders them outcasts,
and sullen or reckless in their general conduct.’&mdash;On
the contrary, they feel settled in their condition; they
know that the cottage which constitutes their home, is
not held upon a precarious tenure: they never feel the
sickening conviction that if they have bread and meat
to-day, they may have only bread to-morrow, and no
food at all the day after. The industrious classes in
Castelcicala are no longer the mere slaves and tools of
the wealthy classes: they are no longer retained in
bondage&mdash;no longer kept in absolute serfdom by an
oligarchy. I now pass to another subject,” said the
Prince: “and here again I refer to the speech of the
Earl of Ellingham&mdash;applying to Castelcicala the observations
which he used in reference to England. The
Castelcicalan industrious classes, then, ‘were ground
down by indirect taxes, in which shape they actually
contributed more to the revenue, in proportion to their
means, than the rich. The only luxuries which the
poor enjoyed, and which had become as it were necessaries&mdash;namely,
tea, sugar, tobacco, beer, and spirits,&mdash;were
the most productive sources of revenue. If aristocrats
reproached the poor for dirty habits, as he well
knew that it was their custom to do, he would ask
them why soap was made an article subject to so heavy
a tax? It was a contemptible fallacy to suppose that
because the poor contributed little or nothing in the
shape of direct taxation to the revenue, they were positively
untaxed. The real fact was that the poor
paid more in direct taxes than the rich did in both direct
and in indirect ways, when the relative means of the
two parties were taken into consideration.’&mdash;Such was
the state of the industrious classes of Castelcicala until
their voice was heard in the legislative assemblies;
and all taxes upon the necessaries of life were speedily
removed. Luxuries alone were left to bear the weight
of taxation&mdash;the duties upon carriages, livery servants,
armorial bearings, hunters, racers, hounds, and foreign
wines being doubled.”</p>

<p>The Prince of Montoni paused; and the Earl of Ellingham
exchanged a rapid but significant glance with
Mr. Hatfield&mdash;for they both remembered the time when,
nineteen years previously, and when the latter lay on
the bed in Old Death’s house, they had conversed upon
the best means of ameliorating the condition of the
suffering millions.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness, finding that his auditors were
most anxious that he should continue his explanations,
and perceiving that Sir John Lascelles had
become especially interested therein, resumed his subject
in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The inequality of the laws, and their incongruity,
severity, and injustice towards the poor, long constituted
a crying evil in Castelcicala. ‘Every advantage
was given to the rich in the way of procuring bail in
those cases where security for personal appearance was
required; but no poor man could possibly give such
security. He must go to prison, and there herd with
felons of the blackest dye. Perhaps on trial his innocence
would transpire; and then what recompense had
he for his long incarceration&mdash;his home broken up
during his absence&mdash;and his ruined family? It was
possible&mdash;nay, it often happened that a man would lie
thus in prison for four or five months previously to
trial; and during that period it would be strange indeed
if he escaped gaol contamination.’&mdash;In order to
remedy these evils, vast facilities were afforded in respect
to bail, the respectability and not the monied
qualifications of the sureties being considered. Thus a
working man may be bailed by any two of his associates
who can obtain a good character from their employer:
this of course applies to charges of a lighter
kind, heavier responsibility being required where a
serious accusation is involved. But even should an
accused have to go to prison until his trial, he is not
placed in a felons’ gaol: he is not, while still untried,
subjected to that indignity and contamination. He is
confined in a building having no connexion with a prison,
and termed <em>A House of Detention</em>. Again, the
judges have the power to order a compensation to
every one whose innocence transpires on trial; and I
must inform you that the trial may take place as soon
after committal as the individual chooses. All depends
on the speed which he makes in getting up his defence.
When committed, he is asked if he have the
means of retaining counsel: if he prove to the magistrate
that he is poor, a barrister is immediately provided
for him. The trial may come on the very next
day; for there are local Courts throughout the Grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Duchy, and these courts have no recess&mdash;no holiday.
Were I, on my return to Castelcicala, to inform a person
not well acquainted with English laws and customs,
that in this very same enlightened England a
man may languish several months in a common gaol
awaiting his trial, I should scarcely be believed.”</p>

<p>“And what is the nature of the punishments inflicted
in the country of your Royal Highness’s adoption?”
enquired Sir John Lascelles.</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” said the Prince. “In the first
place we have abolished the punishment of death, as
barbarian, un-Christian, and demoralizing. Murder is
punished by imprisonment for life; and imprisonment,
fine, confiscation of property in the cases of single
men having no persons dependent on them, and the
loss of civil rights&mdash;these are the penalties used
amongst us. The individual who is condemned to imprisonment,
is not on that account rendered an useless
member of society. Every criminal gaol is an assemblage
of workshops where all trades and manufactures
are carried on; and each prisoner must work at his
own trade, or be taught one. If he have a family
out-of-doors, his earnings go to support that family:
if he have none, they accumulate until the day of his
release. Should he refuse to work, he is put upon
bread and water; and this fare soon compels him to
adopt habits of industry in order to obtain plentiful
and wholesome meals. Castelcicalan prisons resemble
vast factories rather than gaols; and so admirable&mdash;so
salutary&mdash;so reformatory is the discipline maintained
in them, that a prisoner on his emancipation
finds no difficulty in obtaining work again. Employers
consider, in such a case, that he has expiated
an offence which should not be remembered to his
prejudice; and he begins the world again with a new
character. He has, as it were, passed through a criminal
bankruptcy court, and obtained his certificate.
Should he, however, experience any difficulty in finding
employment, the local authorities are bound to
supply him with work at the average rate of wages.
The results of all these arrangements are striking.
In the first place, a Castelcicalan prison is reformatory
instead of being a sink of contaminating iniquity:
secondly, a man on leaving a criminal gaol, is not
forced back into the ways of vice. If he relapse, it
must be through determined wickedness: but relapses
are very, very rare in the Grand Duchy&mdash;for happily
those individuals are few who remain in the ways
of crime for crime’s sake! And now, my lord, you
will perceive how far the framers of all these salutary
enactments respecting prisoners and prison discipline,
were indebted to the following passage in your
speech:&mdash;‘The criminal laws of England are only
calculated to produce widely spread demoralization&mdash;to
propagate vice&mdash;to render crime terribly prolific.
A man no matter what his offence may have been&mdash;should
be deemed innocent and untainted again,
when he has paid the penalty of his misdeeds; because
to brand a human being eternally, is to fly in
the face of the Almighty and assert that there should
be no such thing as forgiveness, and that there is no
such thing as repentance. But the nature of punishments
in England is so to brand the individual, and so
to dare the majesty of heaven. For the gaols are
perfect nests of infamy&mdash;sinks of iniquity, imprisonment
in which necessarily fastens an indelible stigma
upon the individual. He either comes forth tainted;
or else it is supposed that he must be so. Under
these circumstances, he vainly endeavours to obtain
employment; and, utterly failing in his attempt to
earn an honest livelihood, he is compelled perforce to
relapse into habits of crime and lawlessness. This
fact accounts for an immense amount of the demoralization
which the Bishops so much deplore, but the
true causes of which they obstinately refuse to acknowledge.
The criminal gaols are moral pest-houses,
in which no cures are effected, but where the contagious
malady becomes more virulent. Society should
not immure offenders solely for the sake of punishment&mdash;but
with a view to reformation of character.’”</p>

<p>“Castelcicala has the honour of having taken the
initiative in all the great and glorious reforms which
you suggested,” said Mr. Hatfield, turning with admiration
towards the Earl of Effingham. “In England
reform is much talked of; and when a small
concession is made&mdash;for a <em>concession</em> it is in this
country, to all intents and purposes&mdash;the people congratulate
themselves as if their complete emancipation
were at hand.”</p>

<p>“There is a passage in the Earl’s speech,” resumed
the Prince, “which particularly struck the Grand
Duke and the Ministers when they were deliberating
upon the proposed reforms and ameliorations to be introduced
to the Chambers. That passage ran thus:&mdash;‘When
a poor man is oppressed by a rich one, it is
vain and ludicrous to assert that the Courts of Law
are open to him: law is a luxury in which only those
who possess ample means can indulge. In a case
where some grievous injury is sustained by a poor
man&mdash;the seduction of his wife or daughter, for instance&mdash;redress
or recompense is impossible, unless
some attorney takes up the case on speculation;
and this is a practice most demoralizing and pernicious.
But if left entirely unassisted in that respect,
the poor man can no more go to Westminster
Hall than he can afford to dine at Long’s Hotel.’&mdash;Now
in Castelcicala, a plan has been adopted which
seems to meet the difficulties set forth in the Earl of
Ellingham’s speech, and which does not involve the
additional danger of rendering law so cheap as to encourage
litigation in every paltry quarrel. To every
Local Court are attached officers denominated the
<em>Peoples’ Attorneys-General</em>; and any poor man having
a ground of complaint against a neighbour, addresses
himself to one of those officers, who immediately
examines into the affair, and if he see that the plaint
be well founded, he prosecutes on behalf of the poor
man. These officers are paid fixed salaries by the
Government, and dare not take fees. They are selected
with care, and are as incapable of bribery as the judges
themselves;&mdash;and thus every means is taken to
guarantee the poor man justice. Seduction and adultery
are not made mere pecuniary matters in Castelcicala:
they are punished by imprisonment;&mdash;and the penalty
is very heavy in a case where a rich man debauches a
poor man’s daughter. I now pass on to the subject of
Education; and your treatment of this subject, my
dear Earl, in your speech, is not the least remarkable
portion of the oration. You declared that ‘it was
positively shocking to think that such care should be
taken to convert negroes to Christianity thousands of
miles off, while the most deplorable ignorance prevailed
at home. The Church enjoys revenues the amount of
which actually bring the ministers of the gospel into
discredit, as evidencing their avaricious and grasping
disposition;&mdash;while the people remain as uneducated
as if not a single shilling were devoted to spiritual
pastors or lay instructors.’ You boldly ‘accused both
houses of Parliament and the upper classes generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
of being anxious to keep the masses in a state of
ignorance. Where instruction is imparted gratuitously,
it is entirely of a sectarian nature; just as if men
required to study grammar, history, arithmetic, or
astronomy on Church of England principles. The
whole land is over-run by clergymen, who live upon
the fat of it&mdash;Universities and public schools have been
richly endowed for the purpose of propagating knowledge
and encouraging learning,&mdash;and yet the people
are lamentably ignorant. It is a wicked and impudent
falsehood to declare that they are intellectually dull or
averse to mental improvement. Common sense&mdash;that
best of sense&mdash;is the special characteristic of the working
classes; and those who can read are absolutely
greedy in their anxiety to procure books, newspapers,
and cheap publications for perusal. The fact is, that
the mind of the industrious population is a rich soil,
wherein all good seed will speedily take root, shoot up,
and bring forth fruit to perfection: but the apprehensions
or narrow prejudices of the upper classes&mdash;the
oligarchy&mdash;will not permit the seed to be sown. Now
as the soil must naturally produce something, even of
its own accord, it too often gives birth to rank weeds;
and this is made a matter of scorn, reviling, and reproach.
But the real objects of that scorn&mdash;that
reviling&mdash;and that reproach, are those who obstinately
and wickedly neglect to put the good soil to the full
test of fertilisation.’&mdash;All these observations,” continued
his Royal Highness, “were as applicable to
Castelcicala a short time back as they have ever been
and still are in England. But the reforms in the
Church and in the Educational System were not the
least important of those which characterised the new
order of things. The two institutions were separated,
and rendered entirely independent of each other, the
Church being abandoned entirely to the voluntary
principle, and the duty of educating the people being
attached to the State, a Minister of Public Instruction
being appointed. All sectarianism in education is now
abolished: the system is entirely secular. The schoolmasters
are appointed by the municipal corporations
in the various localities, and their salaries are paid by
the State. They are all laymen; for it is now a principle
established in the Grand Duchy that parents
shall train up their children in the creed which they
may prefer. Thus Protestants, Catholics, and Jews
all receive the blessings and benefits of the secular
education; no tampering with religious opinions&mdash;no
proselytism being permitted. The whole scheme is
on the broadest basis of liberality; and the people are
delighted with its working. As for the Church, it is
entirely separated from the State; and the order of
Bishops has been suppressed. The Catholic religion
is still that of the great majority: but it is shorn of
its pomp; and ecclesiastical ostentation and vain display
have received a blow which they will never
recover. The result is, that the Christian creed has
been restored to something resembling its primitive
simplicity, and such as its Divine Founder intended. I
have now, my lord and gentlemen, given you a
hasty, but I hope intelligible sketch of the condition
of Castelcicala at the present day; and it only
remains for me to sum up the reforms which have
been accomplished, and which completely carry out
the views and the theories so ably propounded by you,
my dear Earl, nineteen years ago. In the first place,
there is a Throne surrounded by Republican Institutions;
and the hereditary principle as well as the law
of primogeniture have been annihilated&mdash;never to be
revived. Then, we have adopted ‘a <em>minimum</em> rate of
wages, to prevent the sudden fluctuation of such
wages, and to compel property to give constant employment
to labour:&mdash;indirect taxes upon the necessaries
of life have been abolished;&mdash;the laws and their
administration are equitably proportioned to the relative
conditions of the rich and the poor;&mdash;a general
system of national education has been established, and
intrusted to laymen, totally distinct from religious instruction
and sectarian tenets;&mdash;a complete reformation
in the system of prison discipline has taken place;
and establishments have been founded for the purpose
of affording work to persons upon leaving criminal
gaols, as a means of their obtaining an honest livelihood
and retrieving their characters prior to seeking
employment for themselves;&mdash;and the franchise has
been so extended as to give every man who earns his
own bread by the sweat of his brow, a stake and interest
in the country’s welfare.’”</p>

<p>The Prince ceased speaking; and those who had
been his auditors expressed their sincerest thanks for
the gratifying explanations he had given them with
so much readiness and affability. Nor less were they
charmed to find that a truly liberal and enlightened
system of policy would stand such remarkable tests,
and work so well. The question, whether the nations
of Europe are civilised enough to receive Republican
Institutions, was completely solved, to their satisfaction;
and even Sir John Lascelles, who was somewhat
tainted with the doctrines of the Old School, acknowledged
himself to be a convert.</p>

<p>The party then joined the ladies in the drawing-room
where political subjects gave way to discourse
upon less serious topics;&mdash;and when the company took
their departure, the inmates of the lordly mansion did
not separate to retire to their respective chambers until
they had exchanged many enthusiastic comments upon
the character, disposition, talents, and bearing of his
Royal Highness, the Prince of Montoni.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXIV">CHAPTER CXXXIV.<br />

<span class="medium">A PAINFUL SCENE.</span></h2>

<p>We deemed it advisable to break as little as possible,
by comment or extraneous explanation, the thread of
the Prince of Montoni’s discourse upon the reform that
had been introduced into the Grand Duchy of Castelcicala.
We therefore refrained from giving any account
of the manner in which Charles Hatfield listened, and
received&mdash;or rather, greedily drank in&mdash;the narrative
of his Royal Highness.</p>

<p>To say that the young man heard with enthusiasm,
were to convey but a feeble idea of his emotions as he
hung upon every sentence&mdash;every word, that fell from
the lips of the Earl’s illustrious guest:&mdash;when, however,
we declare that even Perdita’s image fell into the
back-ground of his mind, during the whole time that
the Prince was discoursing, our readers may form some
notion of the nature of that impression which was
made upon him.</p>

<p>On retiring to his chamber at about one o’clock in
the morning, Charles Hatfield thought not of seeking
his couch: but, throwing himself into an arm-chair,
he gave way to the agitating&mdash;conflicting&mdash;turbulent
ideas which had been excited in his soul.</p>

<p>“The modesty of the Prince,” he thought, “concealed
the fact that nearly all the reforms which he
detailed, were suggested by himself. Oh! what would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
I give to be enabled to raise myself to eminence in
the world! Twenty years of my life?&mdash;Ah! yes&mdash;willingly&mdash;willingly
would I yield up a quarter of my
probable existence to gain a name, honoured and renowned
as that of the Prince of Montoni! And is
not rank within my grasp? Can I not in a moment&mdash;by
the waving of my hand, as it were&mdash;place upon my
brow the coronet of a Viscount? May I not yet
stand before the world as the heir-apparent to the
Earldom of Ellingham? Yes;&mdash;and if once I find my
way into the supreme legislative assembly, shall I not
be enabled to advocate the cause of the People, and
obtain a glorious renown? It were trifling with my
own interests&mdash;it were wronging myself, to abstain
from asserting my just rights! If my father choose
to remain a simple commoner and allow his younger
brother to wear the honours and hold the estates of a
proud Earldom, am I to be bound by his will? No&mdash;no:
and my father acts not a parent’s part towards
me in thus keeping me in obscurity. ’Tis clear that
my sire’s early life renders him desirous to shun all
circumstances that may attract attention towards him:
’tis clear&mdash;my God! how dreadful to think of!&mdash;’tis
clear, I say, that he feels the impropriety of a highwayman
laying claim to a lordly title! Oh! the sins
of the father are indeed visited on the child in my
case! But I am innocent: my life has been spotless
and pure&mdash;my character is untarnished. Wherefore
should I suffer for my parent’s crimes? It is unjust&mdash;most
unjust; and even filial duty, in its best and
holiest sense, cannot compel me to renounce the distinctions
to which by birth I am the heir! No&mdash;no:
a young man of my ambition&mdash;my talents&mdash;my feelings&mdash;my
burning hopes, must not immolate himself
for the sake of a father who acts unjustly towards
him. For how stands the case between us? The
question is whether a parent should make any and
every sacrifice for his child; or whether the child must
make all possible sacrifices for his father. In asserting
his rights, claiming his title, and thereby enabling me
to assume my own, he doubtless would have to make
a sacrifice: he must declare who he is&mdash;my God!&mdash;the
Resuscitated Highwayman! But, on the other hand,
in consenting to keep his secret, do I not wilfully
blind myself to my own interests&mdash;wantonly thrust
aside those opportunities of gaining distinction and
acquiring renown which are within my reach&mdash;crush
with suicidal hand the glorious aspirations which I
have formed&mdash;and purposely trample on all the hopes
that are developing themselves before me?”</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield rose&mdash;paced the room in an agitated
manner&mdash;then, reseating himself, again plunged
into his ominous reflections.</p>

<p>“I have read that those who yield to the influence
of false sentimentalism, never rise in the world. He
who would attain to the pinnacle of eminence, must
harden his heart,&mdash;even as did Napoleon, when he
put away from him that charming Josephine who
loved him with such pure and fervid devotion. Yes&mdash;family,
kith, and kindred must be sacrificed&mdash;all sacrificed&mdash;by
him who follows the dictates of his ambition.
And yet&mdash;and yet, did not Richard Markham rise by
his virtues, as much as by his talents and heroism,
to that eminence which enabled him to take his place
amongst the mightiest Princes of Europe? Oh! but
<em>he</em> had opportunities which may never occur again&mdash;he
is the one in the thousand whom Fortune takes by
the hand. If I remain obscure&mdash;unknown&mdash;plain <em>Mr.
Charles Hatfield</em>&mdash;I am but an unit amidst the millions
which, constitute the mass called <em>the People</em>.
But if I suddenly stand forth as a Viscount, and the
heir of a wealthy Earldom, shall I not at once be
placed in a position to carve out a career for myself?
Oh! how glorious&mdash;how thrilling would it be, to have
the power of saying to my Perdita, ‘<em>Beautiful angel!
I am not the obscure young man I appear to be: in
me behold Viscount Marston, the heir to the Earldom
of Ellingham!</em>’ Ah! Perdita, then would you feel
honoured in my love&mdash;and I should not be compelled
to evince my gratitude to thee for loving me! Charming,
adorable Perdita&mdash;thine image is coupled with
the bright dream of ambition that now animates me;&mdash;for
when I shall have distinguished myself in the
Senate, how delicious will it be to see thee welcome
with pride and admiration my return to thine arms,&mdash;to
behold thy fine eyes fixed upon me, eloquently
proclaiming how proud thou art to own the love of a
man who is filling the world with his fame! Yes&mdash;I
must assert my rights:&mdash;but how? Oh! I will
confide all to Perdita&mdash;and she possesses a mind so
strong and an intellect so powerful, that she will
assist me with her counsel in this difficulty. And it
will be so sweet to receive advice from her lips&mdash;so
delightful to mark the interest which she will take in
my affairs!”</p>

<p>Again he rose from his seat: for a sudden thought
had struck him&mdash;accompanied by a severe pang,&mdash;a
pang that went through his heart like a barbed arrow.</p>

<p>“My mother!&mdash;my poor mother!” he murmured to
himself: “Oh! what a blow will it be to <em>her</em> if I compel
my father&mdash;compel her husband&mdash;to assert his
claims to the Earldom of Ellingham! And yet&mdash;was
I not for years neglected by her?&mdash;did she care
for me&mdash;did she even have me to dwell with her
during my infancy? No&mdash;no: I was abandoned to the
woman Watts;&mdash;and had I become a thief in the
streets&mdash;a prowling, houseless vagabond&mdash;my mother
would have been to blame!”</p>

<p>Thus was it that this young man, having imbibed
from Perdita the art and facility of sophistical reasoning,&mdash;thus
was it that he crushed all the naturally
generous feelings of his soul, and struggled desperately
to subdue the promptings of his really good disposition.</p>

<p>Love and ambition produced these baneful effects!</p>

<p>But his love,&mdash;was it a pure and honest love inspired
by a virtuous being?&mdash;or was it a frenzy engendered
and sustained by a depraved and designing woman
endowed with the most glorious beauty?</p>

<p>And his ambition,&mdash;was it that fine spirit of emulation
which warms the generous heart, and prompts
the enlightened mind to seek distinction for the sake
of being enabled, by means of influence and high
position, to benefit the human race?&mdash;or was it a
selfish craving after rank and power, in order to enjoy
the sweets of applause, become the object of servile
flattery, and obtain the honour ever shown in this
country to sounding titles and a proud aristocracy?</p>

<p>The reader can answer these questions for himself.</p>

<p>Having passed nearly two hours in the wild reverie
which suggested schemes so menacing in their nature
to his own and his parents’ happiness, Charles Hatfield
retired to rest;&mdash;and in his dreams he beheld a
variety of scenes and images, incongruously grouped
and confusedly jumbled together,&mdash;the voluptuous
form of Perdita stretched in a witching undress on the
sofa, and extending her arms to welcome him to her
embraces,&mdash;the Marshal Prince of Montoni, seated on
horseback, surrounded by a brilliant staff,&mdash;thousands
and thousands of persons gathered together to witness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
the passing of a gay cavalcade, of which he fancied
himself to be the leader as well as the hero of the occasion,&mdash;and
then his father and mother kneeling and
weeping at his feet, and proffering some prayer to which
he refused to accede. Then he thought that he was
roving in a delicious garden, where the singing of birds,
the hues of the flowers, and the fragrance of aromatic
shrubs made every thing delightful to the senses, and
where Perdita was his companion. She appeared to
be clad in the loose and scanty drapery which heathen
goddesses are represented to wear,&mdash;fastened by a
clasp on the left shoulder, flowing so as to leave the
right bosom entirely bare, and confined by a zone to
the waist. Airily, airily they tripped along together,
until they beheld a temple standing at a distance: then
Perdita suddenly assumed the majesty of a queen&mdash;and
conducting her lover to a shrine within the temple,
made him kneel down while she crowned him with a
wreath of flowers, while unseen minstrels poured forth
a strain of delicious music.</p>

<p>Under the influence of this last dream he awoke;&mdash;and
the image of Perdita still remained uppermost in
his mind.</p>

<p>Then as he performed the functions of the toilette,
he reconsidered all the arguments and plans&mdash;repeated
to himself all the sophistical reasoning&mdash;into which
he had fallen before he retired to rest;&mdash;and, hardening
his heart in respect to his parents,&mdash;yes, and
hardening it, too, with regard to Lady Frances Ellingham,&mdash;he
resolved to sacrifice all and every thing to
the two idols of his soul&mdash;ambition and Perdita!</p>

<p>In this frame of mind he descended to the breakfast-parlour,
where the Earl and Countess of Ellingham,
Lady Frances, Mr. Hatfield, and Lady Georgiana
were already assembled. Charles assumed as gay an
appearance as possible: for he was resolved to mask
his knowledge of all the family secrets as well as his
sinister designs, until he should have consulted with
Perdita. But in spite of himself, there was a certain
constraint and embarrassment in his manner when
he spoke to Lady Frances; and this artless, beautiful
young creature surveyed him with astonishment and
grief.</p>

<p>The fact was that the heart of Charles Hatfield
smote him for the vile and perfidious part he had
enacted towards his cousin; and he scarcely dared to
look her in the face.</p>

<p>Her parents and his own, as well as she herself,
noticed the peculiarity of his demeanour in this respect;
and Lady Georgiana was so affected by his
apparent coolness towards the Earl’s daughter that
it was with difficulty she could restrain herself from
questioning him then and there on the subject. A
hasty whisper, however, from her husband sealed her
tongue and gave her the assurance that he would soon
ascertain the cause of their son’s altered behaviour towards
the young lady who was already looked upon
as his future wife.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the morning repast was concluded,
Mr. Hatfield beckoned his son to follow him to the
library; and now Charles was struck with a sudden
fear&mdash;conscience exciting the apprehension that his
schemings were discovered and seen through by an
outraged, indignant father.</p>

<p>On entering the library, Mr. Hatfield motioned him
to take a seat near him: then, fixing his eyes upon the
young man’s countenance, he said, “Charles, has any
misunderstanding occurred between Lady Frances and
yourself?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not that I am aware of,” returned Charles,
considerably relieved by the question that indicated
the nature of the colloquy which it opened. “Wherefore
should you entertain such an idea?”</p>

<p>“Because your manner towards Lady Frances at
the breakfast-table was cool, constrained, and embarrassed,”
said Mr. Hatfield. “She herself noticed the
circumstance; and I observed that Lord and Lady
Ellingham were pained by it likewise. As for your
mother, Charles&mdash;she was deeply grieved; and I was
both hurt and annoyed.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, my dear father&mdash;but&mdash;but, I was not
aware of any difference in my demeanour towards her
ladyship,” stammered Charles, unskilled as yet in the
arts of duplicity and guile.</p>

<p>“My son&mdash;my dear son, do not attempt to deceive
me!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield, emphatically. “Lady
Frances, in the artlessness of her soul&mdash;in the confiding
candour of her amiable nature&mdash;yesterday acquainted
her mother, the Countess of Ellingham, with
all that had taken place between yourself and her in
the morning. You made her an offer of your hand, in
pursuance of the counsel which I gave you;&mdash;and her
parents will cheerfully yield an assent to your suit.
Indeed, the Earl expected to see you on the subject
yesterday afternoon; but it appears that immediately
after your interview with Lady Frances, you went out
and remained absent for some hours. How you dispose
of your time, it is not for me to enquire: you are of an
age when you are entitled to be your own master. But
this I implore of you,&mdash;lose no time in seeking a private
interview with the Earl, and soliciting him to
accord you the hand of his daughter. ’Tis a mere
ceremony which a parent, and a personage of his standing,
naturally expects you to perform;&mdash;and I promise
you that there is no chance of a refusal.”</p>

<p>“My dear father,” said Charles, the natural candour
of his nature asserting its empire; “I was too hasty
in proposing to Lady Frances. Would to God that I
could recall the step I thus rashly took!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield surveyed his son in profound astonishment
for nearly a minute: then, breaking forth indignantly,
he exclaimed, “What, sir! you have dared to
trifle with the affections of an amiable and accomplished
girl?&mdash;you decline a match which is so desirable in
every point of view, and on which your mother’s heart
is set?”</p>

<p>“I must decline the honour of this alliance,” answered
the young man, speaking with a courage which
even surprised himself.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Charles,” demanded his father, with
on utterance almost suffocated by indescribable emotions,&mdash;“do
you know that your conduct is that of a
villain? And shall it be said that you&mdash;<em>you</em>, a young
man of whom such lofty expectations have been
formed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By whom have these expectations been formed?”
suddenly cried the rebellions son, his choler rising as
all his wrongs, real or imaginary, rushed to his mind,&mdash;those
wrongs which he believed himself to have received
and to be still enduring at the hands of his
parents.</p>

<p>“By whom?” repeated Mr. Hatfield, much pained
by the tone, words, and manner of the young man.
“By whom should such hopes be experienced, save
by your parents?”</p>

<p>“My parents!” cried Charles, with withering irony.
“Wherefore am I not acknowledged as your son?&mdash;why
do you not proclaim yourselves to be my parents?
Was not the discovery on my part a matter of mere
chance?&mdash;and should I not have been kept for ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
ignorant of the fact, had not an accident revealed it
to me?”</p>

<div id="i_097" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Oh! my God!&mdash;this is retribution!” murmured
Mr. Hatfield, bowing himself down, and covering his
face with his hands.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened&mdash;and Lady Georgiana,
pale as death and scarcely able to support herself
on her tottering limbs, made her appearance.</p>

<p>Unable to endure the state of suspense in which she
had been plunged relative to the altered manner of her
son towards Lady Frances at the breakfast-table,&mdash;and
having a vague presentiment that some unpleasant
scene was occurring between him and her husband in
the library,&mdash;she had determined to repair thither and
relieve herself at once from an uncertainty that was
intolerable. But upon reaching the door she heard
Charles talking loudly and bitterly: she instinctively
paused;&mdash;and those terrible questions which he addressed
to his father, smote upon <em>her</em> ear like the voice
of the Angel of Death.</p>

<p>Staggering into the room, she mechanically closed
the door behind her; and then leant against it for
support. Her fine&mdash;her handsome countenance denoted
the most poignant anguish: it was absolutely distorted&mdash;while
a frightful pallor overspread it.</p>

<p>“My mother&mdash;my dear mother!” exclaimed Charles,
bounding towards her;&mdash;for his soul was touched by
the pitiable appearance which she presented to his view.</p>

<p>“Just heaven! Charles&mdash;what have you said to
your father!” she asked, in a tone of despair;&mdash;and
flinging herself into her son’s arms, she gave vent to
a flood of tears.</p>

<p>“I implore your pardon, my dear parents, if in
a moment of haste and impatience I said aught that
can give you offence,” exclaimed the young man: “but
I was not master of my emotions&mdash;for you, my father,
had termed me a <em>villain</em>!”</p>

<p>“Let us not recriminate,” said Mr. Hatfield, rising
and taking his son by the hand, Lady Georgiana having
in the meantime sunk into the chair to which Charles
conducted her. “I was wrong to address you thus
harshly: but your refusal to form an alliance with
Lady Frances, to whom you only yesterday imparted a
confession of attachment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“O Charles! is it possible that your parents are to
experience such bitterness of disappointment as this?”
exclaimed Lady Georgiana, turning a look of appeal&mdash;of
earnest appeal&mdash;upon her son. “You know not how
profound will be my sorrow if you thus enact a perfidious
part towards Lady Frances Ellingham!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>“Would you have me wed when my heart is not
fixed?” demanded Charles, warmly. “I laboured
under a delusion: I fancied that I loved Lady Frances
as one whom I should wish to make my wife&mdash;but
I now find that it was only with the affection of a
brother or of a very sincere friend that I in reality
regarded her! Yesterday morning you, my dear father,
entered my chamber, at a moment when the confusion of
ideas caused by unpleasant dreams was scarcely dissipated;&mdash;you
urged me to confess an attachment to Lady
Frances&mdash;to seek her hand;&mdash;and I obeyed you! But I
acted under an impulse for which I could not account;&mdash;I
yielded to some unknown influence which I could not
resist. And yet it was not love, my dear parents;&mdash;no&mdash;it
was not love! In making Lady Frances my wife I
should only ensure the unhappiness of an excellent&mdash;a
beautiful&mdash;an accomplished girl&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You admit all her admirable qualities, Charles,”
interrupted his mother; “and yet you refuse to avail
yourself of an opportunity to secure so precious a
prize&mdash;to link your fortunes with one who is certain to
make the best of wives!”</p>

<p>“It is truly incomprehensible!” exclaimed Mr.
Hatfield, whose knowledge of the world and large experience
of the human heart convinced him that there
was something more at the bottom of his son’s conduct
than the alleged reasons for so abruptly breaking off a
match that, he thought, must appear in every way so
eligible and advantageous to the young man.</p>

<p>“My dear parents, this scene is most painful to us
all,” said Charles, who, glancing rapidly at the time-piece
upon the mantel, saw that the hour was approaching
for his to visit Perdita.</p>

<p>His father, observing that impatient look cast
towards the clock, instantly comprehended that his
son had some appointment to keep; and connecting
this discovery with the strangeness of his conduct
in respect to Lady Frances, it flashed to his mind in a
moment that the young man had formed some attachment
elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Charles,” he accordingly said, turning abruptly
towards his son and looking him full in the face, “you
love another?”</p>

<p>The young man became red as scarlet, and stammered
out a few unintelligible words, which his father
soon cut short.</p>

<p>“Now we have discovered the truth! But surely
you have formed no unworthy attachment?&mdash;surely
you cannot love one whom you are ashamed to name?”
cried Mr. Hatfield.</p>

<p>“Speak, Charles&mdash;speak! Answer your father!”
said Lady Georgiana, in an imploring tone, as she perceived
her son turn away towards the mantel.</p>

<p>For rebellious thoughts again rose in the mind of the
young man;&mdash;and he felt hurt and vexed that his
conduct should thus be questioned by parents who
never had acknowledged him as their son until the
necessity was forced upon them by his accidental discovery
of the secret of his birth, and who now kept
him out of what he conceived to be his just rights.
Moreover, was he not twenty-five years old?&mdash;and
was that an age at which he should thus be tutored
and treated like a child? Lastly, it was verging fast
upon twelve; and had he not assured his Perdita that
he would not be a minute later mid-day?</p>

<p>“Charles, why do you not answer me?” asked Mr.
Hatfield, approaching him: “wherefore do you treat
your parents with contempt?”</p>

<p>“Wherefore did my parents treat me with such unnatural
neglect as to bring me up as their nephew?”
demanded the young man, turning abruptly&mdash;almost
savagely round upon his father. “Wherefore do they
now pass me off to the world in that latter capacity?”
he cried, becoming fearfully excited.</p>

<p>Lady Georgiana uttered a faint scream, covered her
face with her hands, and fell back in her chair sobbing
bitterly.</p>

<p>“You speak of unnatural conduct!” cried Mr.
Hatfield, growing excited in his turn. “Tell me at
once, Charles&mdash;do you mean to throw off all allegiance
to your parents? If so&mdash;remember that it is in our
power to deprive you of the immense fortune which is
otherwise destined for you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! menaces!” ejaculated the young man: and
darting upon his father a look of mingled regret and
anger&mdash;of united sorrow and indignation,&mdash;a look so
strange, so ominous that Mr. Hatfield started with
horror,&mdash;he rushed from the room.</p>

<p>“Stay! stay!” cried Lady Georgiana, springing
towards the door.</p>

<p>But her son heeded her not: he obeyed not her
voice;&mdash;and the unhappy mother sank upon the floor,
gasping for utterance, and feeling as if her heart would
break with the wretched sensations that filled her
bosom.</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield hastened to raise his wife&mdash;to place her
in a chair&mdash;and to breath words of consolation in her
ears.</p>

<p>When she was somewhat recovered, she clasped her
hands convulsively together; and, looking up appealingly
into his face, said, “Is this a reality? or is it a
dream?”</p>

<p>“Alas! it is a terrible reality,” responded Mr. Hatfield,
in a tone of mingled bitterness and sorrow.</p>

<p>“And what can it all mean?” asked Lady Georgiana,
wildly: for she was bewildered by the strangeness
of her son’s conduct&mdash;amazed by the sudden
alteration of his manner from respect to insolent
indifference towards his parents.</p>

<p>“Heaven alone can solve that question for us at
present,” returned her husband. “Can it be that he
has learnt any thing&mdash;that he suspects aught of the
past? No&mdash;no: that is impossible! But ever since
the discovery of his real parentage, he has been altered;&mdash;sometimes
moody and thoughtful&mdash;at others petulant
and hasty,&mdash;now unnaturally gay and excited&mdash;then
deeply depressed and melancholy,&mdash;but never
unruly and overbearing, disobedient and rebellious, as
he has shown himself this forenoon.”</p>

<p>“’Tis easy to perceive, I fear, that he is troubled by
the mystery which induced us to conceal his position
with regard to us,” said Lady Georgiana;&mdash;“and
likewise&mdash;yes, likewise,” she added hesitatingly, “the
circumstance that he still passes as our nephew weighs
upon his mind!”</p>

<p>“Oh! this is a terrible retribution for my sins!&mdash;an
awful punishment for the foul misdeeds of my earlier
years!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield, wringing his hands
bitterly.</p>

<p>“My dear husband,” said Lady Georgiana, whose
turn it now was to console; “give not way thus to
your sorrow! Let us hope that he will repent of this
strange unruliness of conduct&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Alas! I have sad forebodings of evil!” cried the
unhappy man. “I fear that he has formed some unworthy
connexion, Georgiana: but let us dissemble
our sorrow&mdash;let us not afflict the Earl and the amiable
Esther by giving them any account of the occurrences
of this day.”</p>

<p>“And yet what can we say respecting the union
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
that was contemplated between their amiable daughter
and our son?” demanded Lady Georgiana, in an anxious
tone.</p>

<p>“We will by some means find an excuse for the
embarrassment and coldness of manner which Charles
exhibited at the breakfast-table,” returned Mr. Hatfield;
“and I will seek the earliest opportunity to
reason with him fully and calmly upon the subject.”</p>

<p>“If he should have formed an attachment elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is scarcely probable, when we come to look
calmly at the matter&mdash;since he yesterday morning declared
his affection to Frances.”</p>

<p>“Alas! ’tis a mystery which pains and alarms me,”
said Lady Georgiana.</p>

<p>“A mystery which I will penetrate, my dear wife!”
exclaimed Mr. Hatfield, in a resolute&mdash;almost stern
tone of voice. “But for the present, it is useless to
hazard a conjecture.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXV">CHAPTER CXXXV.<br />

<span class="medium">CHARLES HATFIELD AND MRS. FITZHARDINGE.</span></h2>

<p>It was a little after twelve o’clock when Charles Hatfield
reached the house in Suffolk Street.</p>

<p>“Is Miss Fitzhardinge at home?” he enquired of
the female servant who answered his summons at the
door.</p>

<p>“Have the kindness to walk up into the drawing-room,
sir,” was the response; and, with beating heart,
the young man followed the domestic into the apartment
where he expected again to behold his beauteous
Perdita.</p>

<p>But, to his disappointment&mdash;a disappointment which
he could not conceal, he found himself in the presence
of her mother.</p>

<p>“Be seated, sir,” she said, coldly and formally indicating
a chair, into which Charles Hatfield fell as if in
obedience to the command of a witch. “I have many
matters whereon to converse with you; and, to speak
candidly, scarcely know how to commence. One subject
personally regards you: another intimately relates
to my own interests. But I will begin with that which
so nearly concerns yourself.”</p>

<p>“I am all attention, madam,” said Charles, endeavouring
to assume as respectful a demeanour as possible,
but in reality glancing with much impatience
towards the door&mdash;as if by his eager looks inviting the
entrance of Perdita.</p>

<p>“My daughter will not interrupt us, Mr. Hatfield,”
exclaimed Mrs. Fitzhardinge, with an affectation of
malice which seemed ominous and foreboding to the
young man. “Indeed, whether you will ever see her
again, depends upon the result of our present interview.”</p>

<p>“My God! madam,” cried Charles, in an imploring
tone; “have I offended your beautiful daughter&mdash;or
yourself?”</p>

<p>“I am not precisely offended, Mr. Hatfield,” said
the old woman, assuming a more conciliatory manner:
“but certain explanations are necessary between us;&mdash;and
indeed, it depends entirely on yourself whether
you ever behold Perdita again.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall behold her again, madam,” returned
Charles, emphatically. “And now I can really listen
to you with attention&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And perhaps with patience,” added Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
her rigid features at length relaxing into a faint
smile. “But I will not tax that patience longer than
I can help. Firstly, then, we are to speak of the
matters which concern yourself. And now&mdash;will you
not be surprised when I assure you that I am acquainted
with many strange and marvellous secrets connected
with your family?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Charles, starting.</p>

<p>“But perhaps I even know more than you yourself
are acquainted with?” said Mrs. Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>“No, madam&mdash;no: that is impossible!” he cried,
emphatically.</p>

<p>“Do any of those secrets give you pain to contemplate?”
she asked, fixing her eyes searchingly upon
him. “Pardon me for thus questioning you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And why, madam, do you so question me?” he
demanded, almost angrily.</p>

<p>“Because I am as yet ignorant to what extent your
knowledge may go in certain respects,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Then believe me, madam&mdash;believe me,” cried
Charles Hatfield, bitterly, “when I assure you that I
know much more than you can possibly have an idea
of!”</p>

<p>“Is the name of Rainford familiar to you?” asked
the old woman, steadily watching the effect of her
question.</p>

<p>“Madam,” exclaimed Charles, starting from his
seat, and approaching Mrs. Fitzhardinge in a threatening
manner, “would you taunt me with the infamy
of my birth?&mdash;for I see that it is no secret to you!
But imagine not&mdash;if such indeed be your idea&mdash;that I
am unworthy the love of your daughter Perdita! You
were about to marry her to an old nobleman: what if
a young nobleman were to demand her hand?”</p>

<p>“A young nobleman!” ejaculated Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
now surprised in her turn: for it must be remembered
that all she knew concerning the present subject was
gleaned from the musings of the old gipsy; and those
musings had led her to believe that Charles was the
nephew of Mr. Hatfield, <em>alias</em> Thomas Rainford.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;madam&mdash;a young nobleman!” he repeated,
carried away by the excitement of feelings under
which he laboured: for he fancied that the old lady
had intended to reproach him&mdash;<em>him</em>, the son of the
resuscitated highwayman&mdash;with having dared to love
her daughter. “And now, perhaps, it is your turn to
be surprised: for, as surely as you are seated there, I
am not the plain, and humble, and obscure Charles
Hatfield&mdash;but the <em>Lord Viscount Marston</em>, heir to the
Earldom of Ellingham!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhardinge restrained her surprise with the
utmost presence of mind&mdash;exerting indeed an extraordinary
power of self-controul; and, surveying him
with an unblushing effrontery, she said, “Well, my
lord, your lordship is at length led to confess who you
really are!”</p>

<p>“My lord”&mdash;“your lordship!”&mdash;Oh! how sweetly&mdash;how
sweetly sounded those words on the ears of
Charles Hatfield:&mdash;he forgot that he was the son of
the resuscitated highwayman&mdash;he remembered not
that his sire had passed through the ordeal of a scaffold:
he heard only that he was saluted with a title of
nobility; and already did it seem as if half his ambition
were gratified.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, at length recovering his self-possession,
and subduing as much as possible the wildness
of that joy which had seized upon him, “then it
appears you were acquainted with my right to a title
of nobility?”</p>

<p>“I was,” she answered, with an air of the most perfect
truthfulness: “and believing <em>you</em> to be ignorant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
of that fact, I was anxious to make the revelation to
your lordship.”</p>

<p>“You are consequently acquainted with every thing
that regards me?” continued Charles, not perceiving,
in the still elated condition of his mind, that the question
was foolish became it embraced a vague and undefined
generality.</p>

<p>“Everything, my lord,” returned Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
repeating the titular appellation, because in her latent
shrewdness she saw full well the pleasure that its swelling
sound afforded to the young man.</p>

<p>“This is most strange&mdash;most singular!” cried
Charles, musing audibly: “for I came hither with the
intention of revealing all&mdash;every thing&mdash;to your Perdita,
through whom you would have learnt the entire
particulars in the course of this day;&mdash;and, behold! I
am anticipated&mdash;for you already are as well acquainted
with those most mysterious circumstances as I myself!
But may I ask, madam,” he exclaimed, turning
abruptly towards Mrs. Fitzhardinge,&mdash;“may I ask
how you came to know that Mr. Hatfield is my father,
and that he is the rightful Earl of Ellingham, legitimately
born?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhardinge had hitherto known nothing at
all of those circumstances; but, without manifesting
the least surprise, she said, “Pray be seated, my lord&mdash;compose
yourself&mdash;give not way to unnecessary excitement;
and I will at once proceed to explain all my
conduct to your lordship.”</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield threw himself into an arm-chair,
and showed a disposition to listen with attention.</p>

<p>“Has your lordship ever heard of a gipsy named
Miranda?” enquired Mrs. Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>“Yes: I lately read the entire history of that Octavia
Manners who became Countess of Ellingham, and who
was my father’s mother. The gipsy of whom you
speak was her faithful friend: but she must now be
very old&mdash;even if she be in existence!”</p>

<p>“She <em>is</em> in existence&mdash;or at least was a short time
back,” said Mrs. Fitzhardinge. “From her lips did I
receive the entire history of your family.”</p>

<p>“But she could not have known that the late Earl
of Ellingham married the injured Octavia Manners,”
cried Charles: “she could not have been aware of my
father’s real rank and position.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;she knew all,” returned the wily woman,
uttering a deliberate falsehood: “how and by what
means, it matters not&mdash;neither, indeed, did she inform
me. When the whole tale was revealed to me, I
thought that you must be in ignorance of your just
rights; and, having by accident heard a good account
of your lordship’s generous heart and amiable qualities&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“From whom?” demanded Charles.</p>

<p>“Oh! I must not gratify your curiosity in these
minute details,” exclaimed Mrs. Fitzhardinge. “Suffice
it that I adhere to the important points of our present
topic.”</p>

<p>“Proceed, madam: I will not again interrupt you
unnecessarily,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“Well, then, my lord&mdash;I fancied that it was a flagrant
shame and an abhorrent cruelty thus to retain you
in ignorance, as I supposed, of your true standing in
the world; and a sense of justice determined me&mdash;although
a total stranger to you&mdash;to acquaint your
lordship with those facts which, it however appears,
were already well known to you.”</p>

<p>“To speak candidly, my dear madam,” said Charles,
“I <em>was</em> in complete ignorance of all those circumstances
until eight or ten days ago, when they were
revealed to me by the strangest accident in the
world.”</p>

<p>“May I, without appearing indiscreet, enquire the
nature of the accident that thus put your lordship in
possession of such important&mdash;such vitally important
facts?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly, my dear madam,” returned Charles
Hatfield. “You yourself have behaved to me with so
much kindness and candour in this respect, that I owe
you my entire confidence. A mere chance threw in
my way certain papers which fully prove that Octavia
Manners was the wife of the late Earl of Ellingham
when their child was born; and that my own father,
who now bears the name of Hatfield, but who was
so long and so unhappily known by that of Rainford,
was the child to whom allusion is made.”</p>

<p>“And those papers&mdash;have you them in your possession?”
asked Mrs. Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>“I have&mdash;carefully concealed in a private compartment
of my writing-desk, in my own chamber at
Lord Ellingham’s mansion.”</p>

<p>“But has your lordship no hesitation in proclaiming
your rights and titles&mdash;or rather in acquiring them by
forcing your father to proclaim his own?” demanded
the old woman, again fixing her eyes steadfastly upon
his countenance.</p>

<p>“Ah! <em>there</em>, madam, you touch the wound in my
heart!” exclaimed Charles, the sudden workings of
his countenance displaying the anguish which the
thought excited within him. “I am loth to take the
grand&mdash;the important&mdash;the irrevocable step on the
one hand; and I cannot bear to surrender up all my
privileges on the other. Moreover, my parents have
not acted towards me in a way to render necessary
every sacrifice on my part;&mdash;and even this morning&mdash;this
very morning&mdash;my father added a new injury to
the list of those already committed against me&mdash;a
new wrong, by upbraiding me, under particular circumstances,
with harshness&mdash;even brutality.”</p>

<p>“Certainly your lordship cannot permit a false sense
of filial duty to mar all the golden prospects which
open before you!” exclaimed the vile woman, who was
thus encouraging evil thoughts in the young man’s
mind. “Consider your youth&mdash;your handsome appearance&mdash;your
great talents&mdash;the brilliant hopes
which develop themselves in the horizon of the
future&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! I have thought of all this&mdash;I have weighed
every thing for and against the course which I long
to adopt, but which the interests of my parents
oppose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Charles paused&mdash;dashed his hand against his heated
brow&mdash;and, rising, paced the room in an agitated
manner.</p>

<p>“My lord, this excitement is useless,” said Mrs.
Fitzhardinge. “If you will deign to consider me as a
friend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do&mdash;I do!” he cried, approaching her, and pressing
her shrivelled hand with fervent, but oh! with
how mistaken gratitude: “have you not proved yourself
my friend? Did you not, though a stranger, contemplate
the generous act of revealing to me secrets
which you considered as necessary to be known to
me? And have you not even now given me advice
which is consistent with my interests?”</p>

<p>“Then, if your lordship will thus regard me as a
friend, permit me to suggest that you do not on the
one hand abandon your determination to assert your
rights, nor on the other adopt any course that has not
been well deliberated upon. Consider,” said Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
Fitzhardinge, “your lordship will have to steel your
heart against a father’s prayers&mdash;a mother’s tears:
you will have to contend against the entreaties of
you uncle, the Earl&mdash;and of his handsome Jewish
wife,&mdash;aye&mdash;and the beseechings of their daughter
too;&mdash;for I understand that your lordship has a beautiful
cousin&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! how many hearts may I not have to break
in piling up the fabric of my ambition!” exclaimed
Charles Hatfield, his heart once more smiting him
severely,&mdash;or rather with an anguish that was intolerable.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;those are the considerations which lie before
your lordship,” resumed Mrs. Fitzhardinge. “But
you must also reflect, my lord, upon the immense
interests you have at stake. Is it better to remain
simple <em>Charles Hatfield</em> all your life&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You need not finish the question, madam,” said
the young man, suddenly interrupting the infamous
old harridan, and now speaking in a cold tone of desperate
resolution. “I must persevere: my destiny is
fixed&mdash;and even if hearts break in the struggle, I will
not shrink from the contest that is to give me my
just rights! But let us talk no more of this for the
present. May I be permitted to enquire after your
charming daughter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You have now, my lord, turned the conversation
on the second subject which required discussion between
us,” interrupted Mrs. Fitzhardinge. “Perdita
has confessed to me all that has taken place between
herself and your lordship&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you are doubtless offended!” exclaimed
Charles Hatfield, observing that the old lady’s
countenance had again become very serious.</p>

<p>“No, my lord&mdash;I am not precisely angry,” she returned;
“but I tremble to approach a topic which
involves so many difficulties.”</p>

<p>“Ah! madam&mdash;with your strong mind, all difficulties
are surmountable,” said Charles “and you
have only to stipulate, in order that I shall assent to
every thing that you may propose.”</p>

<p>“In the first place,” resumed the wily woman, “you
are aware of the strange&mdash;fanciful&mdash;and, I must say,
unfortunate notions which my daughter has imbibed
relative to marriage; and your lordship must be aware
that&mdash;supposing your mutual passion be allowed to
take its course unrestrained&mdash;the world will regard her
only as your lordship’s mistress!”</p>

<p>“Madam&mdash;I would cheerfully conduct her to the
altar&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Whither she will not go,” added the old woman,
emphatically. “No&mdash;my lord, it is useless to reason
with that strong&mdash;headed, obstinate girl on the subject.
Admitting, then, that I&mdash;her mother&mdash;placing her
happiness above conventional opinions, and entertaining
implicit faith in your honour and integrity,&mdash;admitting,
I say, that I consent to the union of hearts
proposed in this case,&mdash;waiving the ceremony of the
union of hands,&mdash;can you, my lord, undertake to ensure
my daughter against the contingencies of poverty?”</p>

<p>“Situated as I now am, the means at my disposal
an limited indeed,” said Charles Hatfield: “but the
moment my rights are proclaimed and recognised&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then, at the same instant, the family estates, at
present held by the Earl of Ellingham, will pass into
the hands of your father&mdash;and you still remain totally
dependant upon him until his death,” said Mrs.
Fitzhardinge, embracing at a glance the whole range
of contingencies.</p>

<p>“True!” cried Charles, suddenly becoming much
embarrassed, and seeing difficulties most unexpectedly
start up.</p>

<p>“<em>But</em>,” resumed Mrs. Fitzhardinge, after a few
minutes’ pause, and laying strong emphasis upon the
monosyllable,&mdash;“<em>but</em>, my lord, even should you immediately
quarrel with your father by compelling him to
wrest the titles and estates from the hands of his
younger brother who now holds them, there are ways
and means for your lordship to raise money&mdash;those estates
becoming inalienably yours in the perspective.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I understand&mdash;there is that alternative!”
exclaimed Charles. “But my father would not discard
me altogether&mdash;he would not deprive me of the
means of support during his life-time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know not, my lord, what may be the results
of the family convulsion&mdash;the domestic revolution&mdash;which
your contemplated proceedings will bring about.
Pardon me, my dear Viscount, if I thus dwell upon
matters so purely worldly;&mdash;but remember that I myself
am now placed in a cruel position by the total
wreck of the brilliant hopes which my claims in
Chancery so recently held out;&mdash;and unless I succeed
in raising a few thousand pounds within a week, I shall
positively be menaced with imprisonment in a debtors’
gaol.”</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven!” cried Charles Hatfield: “how
can I possibly assist you?”</p>

<p>“You will not think me mercenary, my lord&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! no&mdash;no, my dear madam!” he exclaimed
impatiently. “Tell me if there be a means of raising
the amount you require; and my readiness to adopt
those means must be received by you as a proof of my
anxiety to render myself worthy of Perdita’s love and
your esteem.”</p>

<p>“Generous nobleman!” cried Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
pretending to be affected by the scene: “my daughter
will indeed be happy in the possession of your heart!
Listen, my lord,” she continued; “and our interview
may soon be brought to a close&mdash;for I know that you
are as anxious to see a certain person as she is dying
to behold you. Your lordship ere now alluded to particular
papers which prove the legitimate birth, rights,
and identity of you father:&mdash;by means of those papers,
and on your lordship signing a document, I can undertake
to procure as large a sum of money as may be
required either by my necessities or for your own
present wants.”</p>

<p>“This evening, my dear madam, I will place the
papers in your hands,” said Charles, who was anxious
to terminate this interview as speedily as possible&mdash;for
his impatience to behold Perdita began to exceed his
powers of endurance.</p>

<p>“At eight o’clock this evening I shall expect your
lordship,” observed Mrs. Fitzhardinge: and, with these
words, she quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield approached the mirror&mdash;arranged
his hair in the most becoming manner&mdash;and had just
snatched a last satisfactory glance at the reflection of
his handsome countenance, when the door opened and
Perdita entered the room.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXVI">CHAPTER CXXXVI.<br />

<span class="medium">INFATUATION.</span></h2>

<p>Perdita was dressed in a more modest and, to speak
truly, in a more delicate manner than on either of the
former occasions when Charles had seen her. A plain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
morning gown, made with a high corsage, set off her
fine figure, without affording even a glimpse of the
charms the full proportions of which its shape developed.
Her hair was arranged in plain bands; and
there was altogether an appearance of so much innocence,
candour, and maiden reserve in her demeanour,
that it seemed to Charles as if he now beheld in her
some new phasis of her wondrous beauty.</p>

<p>Hastening forward to meet her, he caught her in
his arms and covered her lips, her cheeks, and her brow
with kisses: for&mdash;whether it were imagination or
reality we know not&mdash;but she appeared to be far more
lovely than ever in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Dearest&mdash;dearest Perdita!” he exclaimed,forgetting
at that moment all and every thing in the world
save the object of his adoration.</p>

<p>“Charles&mdash;my lord&mdash;how am I to call you henceforth?”
she murmured, in that soft, musical tone
which flowed like the harmony of the spheres in unto
the very soul.</p>

<p>“Am I not <em>Charles</em> to you, dear girl?” he demanded,
looking at her tenderly and half reproachfully:
then, conducting her to a seat, and placing
himself near her, he added, “I have had a long interview
with your mother, Perdita; and from all that I
could gather, she has no opposition to offer to our love.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” responded the girl, casting down her
eyes with a modesty so admirably assumed that it
would have deceived the most experienced individual.
“And are you well satisfied that she has thus proved
favourable to our hopes?”</p>

<p>“Will you always seem to doubt my affection?” demanded
the young man, in an impassioned tone:
“will you ever appear to believe that I am so volatile&mdash;so
fickle&mdash;so inconstant, as to regret to-day a step
that I took yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Charles&mdash;pardon me,” said Perdita,
looking up into his face with an expression of the
most charming <em>naivet&eacute;</em>: “but my mother heard a
rumour&mdash;and yet it might be unfounded&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Speak&mdash;speak, Perdita!” cried the young man,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“A rumour to the effect that you were looked upon
as the future husband of Lady Frances Ellingham,”
added Perdita, in a tremulous tone, as if scarcely
daring to give utterance to the jealous suspicion that
the words implied.</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield became suddenly red as scarlet;
and Perdita burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Oh! then the rumour is true&mdash;and you are deceiving
me, my lord!” she exclaimed, affecting a
passionate outburst of grief: but, in a few moments,
she seemed to exercise an abrupt and powerful controul
over her feelings, and rising from her seat, drew
herself up into a demeanour of desperate calmness,
saying, “Viscount Marston, I will show you that my
affection is of no selfish nature. If you love this
young lady, who must be your cousin, from all I have
heard and know through my mother,&mdash;if you prefer
the beauteous Frances&mdash;for beautiful I am aware she
is,&mdash;Oh! then I release you from your vows to me&mdash;I
restore your plight&mdash;and I, the obscure and neglected
Perdita, will pray in secret for your welfare,&mdash;yes, and
for the welfare of her who will have robbed me of
your affections!”</p>

<p>“No, Perdita&mdash;no!” cried Charles, profoundly
touched by this well-enacted piece of apparently
generous self-denial: “I do <em>not</em> love my cousin
Frances&mdash;and it was only this very morning that I
disputed with my parents because I refused to form an
alliance on which their hearts are set. Perdita&mdash;my
beloved Perdita, I thank thee&mdash;Oh! heaven alone
knows how sincerely I thank thee for this manifestation
of generosity,&mdash;a generosity that, if possible, has
rivetted my affections more indissolubly on thee!”</p>

<p>“And you will pardon me, Charles&mdash;if in a moment
of jealousy&mdash;&mdash;” murmured the designing young
woman, hanging down her head in a charming kind
of confusion and bashfulness.</p>

<p>“Pardon thee!” repeated her dupe, catching her in
his arms, and straining her passionately to his breast:
“what have I to pardon? Must I pardon thee for
loving me so well, my Perdita?&mdash;for only those who
love well, can know what jealousy is! And, did I
think that I had cause, should I not be jealous of thee,
sweet Perdita? Oh! yes&mdash;and my jealousy would be
very fierce and terrible in its consequences. But on
neither side shall there be cause for jealousy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“At least not on mine, Charles,” returned the young
woman, gently extricating herself from his arms, and
resuming her seat upon the sofa. “And now, my
lord,” she added playfully, “when do you intend to
take some charming suburban villa&mdash;fit it up in a
chaste, elegant, and beautiful style&mdash;and bear thither
your bride,&mdash;for your bride am I prepared to become
on the conditions which have already been established
between us?”</p>

<p>“Without a day’s&mdash;without an hour’s unnecessary
delay, my beloved Perdita,” answered Charles, his
cheeks flushing and his eyes sparkling with the hopes
and voluptuous thoughts inspired by the question thus
put to him; and throwing his arms around her, he
drew the bewitching syren towards him.</p>

<p>“Charles&mdash;Charles,” she murmured, as he glued his
lips to her warm, glowing cheek; “you are adorably
handsome&mdash;and I love you as woman never loved
before. But I implore you to release me now&mdash;for&mdash;my
mother might return to the room&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh!
Charles&mdash;you clasp me too violently&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And she succeeded in disengaging herself from his
arms, having maddened him as it were by the contact
of her fine, voluptuous form, and the caresses she had
allowed him to lavish upon her.</p>

<p>“Perdita, you are more reserved with me than you
were yesterday,” said Charles, half reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Or rather say that yesterday I was so hurried
away by the rapturous thoughts&mdash;the delightful emotions&mdash;the
elysian feelings which were excited within
me by the certainty of possessing your love,” murmured
the young woman, “that I had no controul
over myself.”</p>

<p>“And now that you are assured of my love, you
have grown comparatively cold and reserved,” said
Charles, with the least degree of humour.</p>

<p>“Should you think the better of me if I were without
the least particle of maiden reserve?” she asked,
in a reproachful tone. “Listen, my beloved Charles&mdash;and
look not angrily on your Perdita!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not for worlds!” he exclaimed, pressing her
hand to his lips, and feeling in the renewed infatuation
of his soul that he was prompt to do her bidding and
yield to her will in all things.</p>

<p>“Now you are kind and good&mdash;and I love you, dear
Charles,” said Perdita, in a tone of captivating artlessness.
“Although we shall have no bridal ceremony
as performed at a church,” she resumed, “yet
must our wedding-day&mdash;if I may so call it&mdash;be duly
fixed and celebrated. When, therefore, you have provided
for me and my mother such a home as you
would wish me and my parent to possess&mdash;then shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
you bear me thither, my dearest Charles, as your
bride&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I will be unto thee as a wife in all
respects,” she added, bending her beauteous head
down upon his bosom, and concealing her blushing
countenance there.</p>

<p>“Be it as you say, my sweet Perdita!” he exclaimed.
“And in all things will I do your bidding&mdash;for
I love and adore you. You are an angel of beauty;&mdash;your
manners are irresistibly winning;&mdash;your voice
has the charm of the sweetest melody;&mdash;and your looks
would kindle love in the breast of an anchorite.”</p>

<p>“Ah! flatterer,” she cried, raising her head, and
tapping him gently upon the face. “Will you always
think thus well of me?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;always, always!” he exclaimed&mdash;so completely
infatuated was he with the syren. “And now
tell me, my charmer&mdash;in which part of London should
you wish me to fix upon a beautiful villa for your
reception?”</p>

<p>“The more secluded the spot&mdash;the better,” said
Perdita. “I do not wish to form the acquaintance of
prying and curious neighbours, nor shall I court the
presence of visitors. When you are with me, I shall
have no thought but for you: when you are absent, to
think of you will be sufficient occupation. I have
heard that in the neighbourhood of Holloway there
are some delightful villas, newly built&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Holloway! It is there&mdash;in that neighbourhood&mdash;that
Markham Place, the mansion where the Prince
of Montoni is staying, is situated.”</p>

<p>“And you are acquainted with that Prince?” said
Perdita. “Yes&mdash;for in this morning’s newspaper I
read, amongst the Fashionable Intelligence, that his
Royal Highness had yesterday partaken of a banquet
at the mansion of the Earl of Ellingham in Pall
Mall.”</p>

<p>“Oh! he is a great and illustrious Prince, Perdita!”
cried Charles, his cheeks suddenly glowing with animation.</p>

<p>“But he is not so handsome as you, Charles?” said
Perdita, half enquiringly&mdash;half playfully.</p>

<p>“He is very handsome, dearest,” was the reply:
“but his heroic deeds&mdash;his noble disposition&mdash;his
boundless philanthropy&mdash;and his staunch support of
the Rights of Man, constitute attractions which, were
he ugly as Satan, would render him adorable as an
angel.”</p>

<p>“And have you none of those qualities, my Charles?”
demanded Perdita. “Are you not gloriously handsome?&mdash;have
you not a proud title, which you can
claim when you will&mdash;aye, and which you will claim
shortly?&mdash;and will you not some day be a Peer of the
Realm, and able to electrify the senate with your
eloquence? For that you would be eloquent, Charles,
I am convinced;&mdash;and, oh! what pleasure&mdash;what unfeigned,
heart-felt pleasure would it give your devoted
Perdita to occupy even the humblest, most secluded
nook in the place where you were delivering yourself
of the burning thoughts and splendid ideas&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! Perdita&mdash;do you too hope that I shall yet
create for myself a great and a glorious reputation?”
demanded the young man, surveying his beauteous
companion with joy and surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, Charles: for do I not love thee?” she asked,
in her dulcet, silvery tone.</p>

<p>“Now&mdash;oh! now can I understand how the image
of the Princess Isabella might cheer and hearten on
the once obscure Richard Markham to the accomplishment
of those great deeds which have placed him on
so proud an eminence! Now,” continued the enthusiastic,
infatuated Charles,&mdash;“now can I comprehend
how gallant knights, in the days of chivalry, would
dare every peril&mdash;encounter every danger, at the behest
or command of their ladye-loves! And you, my
Perdita,&mdash;you shall be as a Princess Isabella in my
eyes&mdash;you shall be my ladye-love;&mdash;and animated by
thy smiles, will I yet carve out for myself a glorious
career in the world.”</p>

<p>“I long to see thee in possession of thy titles, Charles&mdash;to
behold thee, too, occupying thy place in the
House of Peers,” said Perdita. “But, hark&mdash;the
clock strikes two; and now I am compelled to accompany
my mother into the City&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To her attorney’s?” asked Charles, a sudden fear
seizing upon him.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;to her solicitor’s office,” responded Perdita:
then, after suffering him to manifest a sentiment of
pique and annoyance for a few moments, she threw
her arms around his neck, exclaiming, “And so you
are very jealous, sir&mdash;are you?&mdash;and you thought perhaps
that I was about to call upon this lawyer to
signify to him my readiness to accept the hand of the
old nobleman who is my mother’s relentless opponent
in the suit? But I can assure you that the object of
my visit in that quarter is one which you will no
doubt highly approve. It is to inform the legal gentleman,
with my own lips, that I utterly and totally
decline the honour of the proposed union&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Charming&mdash;dearest Perdita!” ejaculated Charles,
straining her in rapture to his breast.</p>

<p>“Inasmuch,” she added, with playful artlessness&mdash;or
rather with an affectation of that delightful <em>naivet&eacute;</em>,&mdash;“inasmuch
as the solicitor will not believe that I can
possibly resist so splendid an offer; and he is determined
to hear the truth from me&mdash;and from me
only.”</p>

<p>“And were he to over-persuade you, Perdita&mdash;to
impress you with the necessity of yielding in this instance&mdash;&mdash;”
began Charles, still labouring under the
vague apprehension with which the artful creature
sought to inspire him in order to attach him the more
completely to her.</p>

<p>“Have you so much to fear on the part of an old
nobleman whom I have never seen, as I have on the
part of that beautiful Lady Frances who dwells beneath
the same roof with you?” enquired Perdita, in the
most melting tones of her flute-like voice.</p>

<p>“Pardon me&mdash;pardon me, dearest girl!” cried
Charles, embracing her fondly.</p>

<p>“I have no more to pardon in you at present, than
you had to forgive in me ere now,” murmured the
guileful woman, placing her warm cheek against his
own and allowing their hair to mingle.</p>

<p>For a few moments she remained with him in this
position,&mdash;a position that enchanted, thrilled, and intoxicated
him: then suddenly withdrawing herself
from his arms, she said, archly, but impressively, “It
now remains with you, Charles, when our wedding-day
is to be celebrated.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if you were only as impatient as I!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>They parted&mdash;the young man hastening, as was his
wont after these visits, to the park to feast his imagination
with a delicious reverie the whole and sole subject
of which should be Perdita!</p>

<p>A few minutes after he had taken his departure,
Mrs. Fitzhardinge sought her daughter in the drawing-room;
and the ensuing dialogue took place.</p>

<p>“Every thing tends to forward our designs with
respect to this young man,” observed the old woman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
seating herself in a chair opposite to her daughter, who
was reclining upon the sofa.</p>

<p>“And yet I cannot <em>now</em> altogether comprehend your
policy, mother,” returned Perdita.</p>

<p>“In which particular point, my child?” demanded
the vile parent.</p>

<p>“Respecting the nature of the connexion which is to
subsist between myself and Charles,” said Perdita. “It
was all very well for me to calculate upon being his
mistress before we were aware that he is in reality a
Viscount, and must be an Earl: but since you succeeded
so nicely in extracting those revelations from
him this morning, why should we not secure so glorious
a prize by a means more durable and powerful than
mere sophistry and the love which he bears me? Consider,
mother, how instantaneously he took a fancy
to me; and believe me when I assure you that coolness
will follow as rapidly, after full satiety, on his
part.”</p>

<p>“Silly girl! thou art thyself in love with him!”
cried Mrs. Fitzhardinge, in a tone of vexation.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;more than half: I acknowledge it,” returned
Perdita, coolly.</p>

<p>“And yet&mdash;but a few days ago you assured me that
you could not chain yourself to one individual with
any hope of being faithful to him,&mdash;that love was a
passion which would never obtain over you that influence
which it so often exercised over the weak, the
simple-minded, and the infatuated.”</p>

<p>“It is perfectly true, mother, that I said all which
your memory has so faithfully treasured up, and your
lips so accurately repeated,” said Perdita, still speaking
without excitement. “But <em>then</em>, my dear mother,” she
added, almost satirically&mdash;no, almost jeeringly, as if
diverting herself with her parent’s evident vexation,&mdash;“<em>then</em>,
you know, I had not seen Charles Hatfield.”</p>

<p>“And I told you not to be too confident on that
point to which we are alluding,” cried Mrs. Fitzhardinge.
“My dear Perdita, renounce all ideas of
marriage with this young man: indeed, you have compromised
yourself too deeply in your denunciations of
the marriage-tie to be able to recall your sentiments
on that head.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Perdita, authoritatively. “In the
same way that I induced Charles to accede to my proposals,
and even fall into my views&mdash;so can I, in a very
short space, and by means of other sophistry, convince
him that I had merely been playing a part to
test the value of his affection&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, Perdita: you must not attempt such a
perilous proceeding,” said Mrs. Fitzhardinge, evidently
listening with great uneasiness to the words that fell
from her daughter’s lips.</p>

<p>“I dare and will attempt all I choose or fancy with
that young man!” cried the head-strong Perdita, in
an imperious tone.</p>

<p>“Will you not follow my counsel?” demanded Mrs.
Fitzhardinge. “Have I not fulfilled all my promises
to you?&mdash;did I not declare that in London you should
find luxury, plenty, and ease?&mdash;did I not pledge myself
that the young man should sue at your feet and implore
your love?&mdash;and could you have brought about
all these results for yourself?”</p>

<p>“I do not pretend that I could, mother,” returned
Perdita. “But am I to be your tool&mdash;your instrument&mdash;an
automaton in your hands?&mdash;am I not to have an
opinion in our councils?&mdash;or am I to pay blind obedience
to you, even though I have reasons for questioning
the prudence of your proceedings?”</p>

<p>“And do you now question the prudence of my proceedings?”
demanded Mrs. Fitzhardinge, growing
every moment more and more irritable.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I do!” answered Perdita, firmly and resolutely&mdash;at
the same time fixing her brilliant eyes
rebelliously upon her mother. “I admit that if we
had only ensnared in our toils a simple commoner&mdash;a
plain Charles Hatfield&mdash;with limited resources within
his reach, it would have been advisable to form no
lasting connexion with him. But now&mdash;<em>now</em> that we
are assured, beyond all possibility of doubt, that he is
himself a nobleman and the heir to enormous wealth,
it would be madness&mdash;it would be folly not to bind him
to us by irrefragable chains. Why&mdash;here is a position
to be obtained and ensured at once,&mdash;a position which
will render us rich for the remainder of our days! And
think you, mother, that I have not a little feeling
of ambition in my soul? Would it not be a proud
thing for you to be enabled to call the Vicountess
Marston&mdash;and in due time the Countess of Ellingham&mdash;your
daughter? All these considerations never
flashed to my mind until immediately after Charles
had quitted the room ere now: or I should have assuredly
commenced the undoing of all that stupid work
which, by your persuasion and so well tutored by you,
I achieved in respect to the conditions whereon our
connexion was to be based. What!” she cried, her
eyes absolutely flashing fire: “have a coronet within
my reach&mdash;and refuse it!&mdash;have a wealthy noble&mdash;or
one who will be enormously wealthy&mdash;sighing at my
feet, and not wed him! Mother,” she cried, actually
exciting herself into a passion, “you must think me
to be a fool&mdash;an idiot&mdash;a mad woman!”</p>

<p>“I shall think you to be a fool&mdash;an idiot&mdash;and a
mad woman if you persist in thwarting my plans or
proceeding contrary to my advice,” said Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
her tanned, weather-beaten countenance becoming
absolutely livid with rage.</p>

<p>“Ah! you have some sinister purpose to serve,
mother!” cried Perdita, a sudden idea striking her:
“else never would you oppose yourself so completely
to the dictates of common sense. What were your
words to me when I spoke to you&mdash;and spoke as
rashly&mdash;about the inaccessibility of my soul to the
passion of love? You advised me not to count only
on the chance of making a good match: you declared
it to be far more probable that I might ensnare some
young gentleman of birth, family, and fortune&mdash;or
some old voluptuary of immense wealth;&mdash;and you
added that there was more to be gained as the mistress
of one of those, than as a wife. In fine, your advice
was that I should remain unmarried and independent,
so that the moment I had ruined one lover, I might
take another.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and that counsel was the wisest I could
proffer you,” said her mother, actually speaking in a
savage tone, and looking as if she could have leapt,
tigress-like, upon her daughter and torn her with her
nails as if they were claws.</p>

<p>“Oh! the advice was good enough under certain
circumstances,” exclaimed Perdita. “It was good in
so far as it related to the probability of my securing a
succession of lovers, each with only a comparatively
small fortune, and each individual, therefore, to be
soon set aside. But now that, at the very outset,
chance has thrown in my way a young noble, who
must sooner or later inherit a vast fortune which no
extravagance can completely dissipate,&mdash;a fortune,
indeed, which will minister to all extravagances, and
yet remain unimpaired,&mdash;should I not be the veriest
fool that ever tossed gold into a river or hurled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
diamonds into an abyss, were I not to secure the
brilliant advantage thus placed within my reach?”</p>

</div>

<p>“Daughter,” exclaimed the old woman, with difficulty
preventing a complete outburst of her fury, “I
tell you that this may not be! Secure Charles Hatfield&mdash;or
rather Viscount Marston&mdash;as your paramour:
<em>I</em> will undertake to raise as much money, as you can
persuade him to lavish upon you;&mdash;and then&mdash;<em>then</em>,
my child,” she added, adopting a tone of fawning conciliation,
“you can choose a new lover and make inroads
into another’s fortune.”</p>

<p>“I am determined to pursue and follow out the
plan which my own convictions indicate as the most
rational&mdash;the most sensible&mdash;the most advisable!”
exclaimed Perdita; “and, therefore, the present dispute
is useless and absurd.”</p>

<p>“Dispute!” repeated Mrs. Fitzhardinge, her countenance
again becoming absolutely livid, and her whole
form trembling with rage: “I do not choose to dispute
with you, insolent girl that you are! Now listen
to me, Perdita&mdash;and know once for all that I <em>will</em> be
obeyed in this, as in all things&mdash;or I will abandon you
to your own resources&mdash;I will hurl you back into
rags, want, and poverty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not while I possess this beauty of which a queen
might be proud!” said Perdita, in a quiet manner, as
she glanced with self complacency at her own handsome
countenance as it was reflected in a mirror
opposite.</p>

<p>“Oh! think not that beauty is the only element of
fortune!” cried the old woman, surveying her daughter
with almost an expression of fiend-like hate: “for,
if you dare to thwart me, Perdita, I will become your
bitterest and most malignant enemy, though you are
my own child:&mdash;I will pursue thee with my vengeance;&mdash;wherever
you may be, I will spoil all your
machinations and ruin all your schemes;&mdash;nay, more&mdash;I
will compel your very lovers to thrust you ignominiously
forth from them! For I will boldly proclaim
how that Perdita who has enthralled them, was accursed
from her very birth&mdash;born in Newgate&mdash;thence taken
by her mother to a penal colony, where she became
lost and abandoned at the early age of thirteen&mdash;and
how every handsome young officer in garrison at
Sydney could boast of the favours of this profligate
young creature!”</p>

<p>A mocking laugh came from the lips of Perdita,&mdash;a
laugh that rang more horribly in the ears of her
mother than an explosion of maledictions, recriminations,
and insults would have done,&mdash;a laugh that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
seemed to say, “Wretched&mdash;drivelling old woman, I
despise thee!”</p>

<p>“You will repent this conduct, vile girl&mdash;you will
repent it!” muttered Mrs. Fitzhardinge, approaching
Perdita, and gazing on her with eyes that seemed to
glare savagely. “Whatever be the risk&mdash;even though
I involve myself in the downfall of our splendid
prospects&mdash;I will ruin thee, if thou darest to oppose
and thwart me! Abandon thy scheme of marrying
the young nobleman&mdash;and we will be friends again:
persist in it&mdash;and we separate, as mortal enemies.
Yes&mdash;and the first step which I shall take will be to
repair to Charles Hatfield&mdash;implore his forgiveness for
having been a party to the scheme plotted against
him and his&mdash;and give such a character of thee, Perdita,
that his blood shall run cold in his veins at the
mere thought of ever having been placed in contact
with thee! And, oh! the picture which a mother
will draw of her daughter in such a case,&mdash;that picture
will be terrible&mdash;very terrible! Pause, then&mdash;reflect&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One word, mother,” said Perdita, who had maintained
an extraordinary degree of composure throughout
this scene&mdash;doubtless because she knew that she
must triumph in the long run. “You threaten
bravely: let us look calmly and deliberately at what
must be the inevitable results of a fearful quarrel
between you and me:&mdash;let us see who would get the
better of it! On one side would be you&mdash;old&mdash;ugly&mdash;disgustingly
ugly, I may say&mdash;so that to become
anything save a beggar, grovelling in the kennel
would be impossible. On the other side would be
myself&mdash;at all events handsome enough to gain the
favour of some soft fool: and, spoil my character as
you will, you cannot prevent me from finding a paramour
amongst those who care nothing for the reputation,
but every thing for the beauty, of their mistresses.
Bread to me is certain: rags and starvation to you are
equally well assured. My life of pleasure, gaiety, and
dissipation is to come: yours has passed&mdash;and naught
remains for you save to die in a workhouse or on a
dunghill! Pardon me, my dear mother, for speaking
thus openly&mdash;thus plainly,” added the young woman,
now throwing a spice of irony into her tone: “but
you did not spare me when you summed up my
characteristics just now. And before I quit the subject,
I may as well observe that you yourself are not
the most immaculate woman upon the face of the
earth. Heaven only knows how prolific were the
debaucheries of your youth: but you veiled them all
beneath the aspect of a <em>saint</em>! Oh! that was excellent,
dear mother&mdash;excellent, indeed!” cried Perdita,
her merry, musical laugh echoing through the apartment:
“only conceive you once to have been a <em>saint</em>!
In good truth, you have not much of the appearance
of a saint now, mother: neither had you when living
with the free-settler as his mistress!”</p>

<p>“Perdita&mdash;Perdita!” gasped the wretched Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
writhing like a snake at these bitter words, and
shaking convulsively from head to foot: “you&mdash;you
will drive me mad!”</p>

<p>“Ah! what&mdash;do you possess <em>feelings</em>, then, my dear
mother?” demanded the young woman, assuming an
air of profound astonishment. “And yet you must
have imagined that your daughter was totally without
those same little feelings which it is so easy to wound,
and so difficult to heal. Well&mdash;I will forbear: otherwise,
I was about to have reminded you of those
glorious times&mdash;before I was born, indeed&mdash;when you
were the paramour of Sir Henry Courtenay, whose
name you so pleasantly and quietly forged to a slip
of paper one day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence&mdash;Perdita&mdash;silence!” said Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
in a hoarse and hollow tone&mdash;clasping her hands convulsively
at the same time. “I was wrong to provoke
you thus: you are very hard upon me&mdash;you have the
best of it, Perdita&mdash;and I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here the old wretch burst into tears,&mdash;not an assumed
grief&mdash;no crocodile weeping,&mdash;but a flood of
genuine tears, wrung from her by the cutting, biting,
bitter sarcasms which her daughter had so mercilessly&mdash;so
slaughterously levelled against her.</p>

<p>Perdita suffered her to weep without offering the
least consolation: for the young woman was hurt and
wounded on her side as well as the old harridan was
hurt and wounded on the other.</p>

<p>The recriminations of those two females&mdash;that
mother and daughter&mdash;had been terrible in their implacability,
and appalling in their unnatural malignity.</p>

<p>There was a long pause&mdash;during which Mrs. Fitzhardinge
sate sobbing&mdash;being absolutely hideous in her
grief,&mdash;while Perdita&mdash;with flashing eyes dilating
nostrils, flushing cheeks, and palpitating bosom, lay
half reclined upon the sofa&mdash;tapping the carpet petulantly
with the tip of her long, narrow, exquisitely
shaped shoe.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” at length said the old woman,
“are we to be friends or enemies?”</p>

<p>“That depends entirely upon yourself, mother,” was
the answer: “I am not to be tyrannised over by you&mdash;nor
menaced in the fearful way in which you have
threatened me to-day, without showing resentment in
return. Really, one would have supposed that you
were addressing yourself to the bitterest enemy you
had in the world&mdash;rather than to your daughter who
has done all she could to place you in a comfortable
position for the remainder of your days.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well&mdash;let us be friends, Perdita!” exclaimed
Mrs. Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;we will be friends,” responded the daughter.
“But remember that my views in respect to Charles
Hatfield&mdash;or rather, Viscount Marston&mdash;are to be carried
into effect.”</p>

<p>“Without again quarrelling,” interrupted her mother,
“let me assure you that I cannot&mdash;cannot possibly
consent to this deviation from our original arrangements.
It was an express understanding between us
that <em>marriage</em> was, in every case, to be out of the
question&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And may not circumstances transpire to change
original plans?” demanded Perdita, beginning to
divine the reasons of her mother’s uncompromising
opposition to her matrimonial scheme.</p>

<p>“A truce to these arguments!” cried Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
again growing irritable. “Remember that
this evening your love-sick swain will deposit in my
hands all the papers containing the evidence of his
father’s right to the earldom and estates of Ellingham&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you will use your power to coerce me?” said
Perdita, in her quiet way, which nevertheless seemed
to breathe defiance.</p>

<p>“I do not affirm <em>that</em>, my child,” cried the old
woman, smothering her rage. “But I would ask you
of what use those papers would be without my assistance
to raise money on them?”</p>

<p>“Of no more utility than our acquaintance with
Charles would be to <em>you</em>, were it not for <em>me</em>,” returned
Perdita. “And now, mother, I may as well inform
you at once that I can penetrate into all the motives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
which prompt you thus to oppose my marriage views
with respect to Charles. You imagine that if I become
his mistress only, I shall be so completely in your
power that I must still continue your slave,&mdash;that a
word from you relative to my past life would send
away Charles Hatfield in disgust,&mdash;and that in order
to prevent you from speaking that word, I shall obey
you blindly. In fine, you hope to exercise a despotism
alike over him and me,&mdash;dispose of the purse&mdash;and
control the household with sovereign sway. On the
other hand, you imagine,&mdash;nay, do not look so black,
my dear mother&mdash;we are only telling each other a few
agreeable truths&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on, vile girl!” gasped Mrs. Fitzhardinge, trembling&mdash;suffocating
with rage.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, then,” pursued the young
woman, in a placid, unexcited manner,&mdash;“on the other
hand you suppose that if once I become the wife of
Charles Hatfield&mdash;if once he shall have taken me for
better or worse&mdash;if once the indissoluble knot be tied,
your power over me would cease. For were you to
avenge any slight by making revelations respecting
me, I might lose my husband’s esteem and love, but
should not the less remain his wife. You therefore
dread lest you should become a cypher&mdash;dependant
upon us for your daily bread&mdash;unable to control the
purse and the domestic economy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what will you do to guarantee that all you
are now saying is not a predictive sketch of what you
know must happen in case I permit your marriage?”
demanded Mrs. Fitzhardinge, dismayed by this accurate
reading of her heart’s secrets on the part of her
daughter.</p>

<p>“I can only assure you this much, mother,” was the
answer,&mdash;“that if you conduct yourself well towards
me, I shall act well towards you,&mdash;that you shall have
your own way in every thing where my will is not
violently thwarted,&mdash;and that I will co-operate with
you cheerfully for our mutual interests, so long as you
do not attempt to drive me as a slave.”</p>

<p>“And all this you faithfully promise, Perdita?”
demanded her mother, eagerly; for she was now glad
to effect any compromise rather than come to an open
rupture with her daughter, who, she saw, had in reality
so much the better of her.</p>

<p>“Be assured, mother,” replied Perdita, “that I am
not for war;&mdash;and if we quarrel any more, it will be
your fault.”</p>

<p>“We will <em>not</em> quarrel, Perdita,” said Mrs. Fitzhardinge:
“you shall marry Charles Hatfield&mdash;or Viscount
Marston, as we ought to call him;&mdash;and here let our
dispute finish.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart. And now tell me, mother,
how&mdash;where&mdash;and with whom you intend to raise the
money upon these papers which Charles is to send or
bring in the evening?”</p>

<p>“A few evenings ago, when I was lurking about
Pall Mall waiting for that young gentleman, I suddenly
encountered a person whom I had known years
and years since, and who played me a vile&mdash;a very vile
trick. He was much altered,” continued Mrs. Fitzhardinge;
“but I knew him&mdash;knew him the moment
the light of the lamp flashed upon his features. I
accosted him&mdash;told him who I was&mdash;and upbraided
him for his villainy of former times. He spoke softly
and in a conciliatory manner&mdash;and we fell into a more
amicable train of conversation than at first. We soon
understood each other; and giving me his address&mdash;for,
by-the bye, he has taken a new name&mdash;he invited
me to call upon him&mdash;and we parted. Since then I
have made enquiries in the neighbourhood where he
dwells; and I learn that he is reputed to be immensely
rich&mdash;a miser and money-lender. He is therefore the
man whom I require;&mdash;and we may reckon confidently
upon his aid in the business of raising funds on the
documents. This very evening I will call upon
him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You will permit me to accompany you, mother,”
said Perdita, rather in a tone of command than of
interrogatory.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;if such be your pleasure,” was the reply: for
the old woman saw that it was useless and totally
adverse to her own interests to thwart her daughter in
any single respect.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXVII">CHAPTER CXXXVII.<br />

<span class="medium">TWO MORE OLD ACQUAINTANCES.</span></h2>

<p>It was about eight o’clock in the evening of the same
day when these scenes took place, that an old man,
coming from a northern direction, entered the metropolis
by the suburb of Pentonville.</p>

<p>He was upwards of seventy-four years of age,&mdash;tall&mdash;thin&mdash;and
retaining so much muscular vigour as
only to stoop slightly in his gait. His complexion
was perfectly cadaverous in hue, ghastly and careworn,
and sinister in its expression. His attire was shabby,
thread-bare, and travel-soiled,&mdash;his dusty boots denoting
that he had journeyed some distance on foot.
Nevertheless, there was about him a certain air which,
in spite of his repulsive features and his sordid garb,
denoted gentility; and an observer would have pronounced
him to be, as indeed he was, a decayed gentleman.</p>

<p>Having passed by the Model Prison, he struck out
of the highway into the fields where so many houses
are now rapidly springing up, and which lie in the
immediate vicinity of the Barnsbury and Liverpool
Roads.</p>

<p>It was evident, however, that he had no definite
object in view&mdash;no home whither he was proceeding;
and he had turned into the fields merely to rub off
the dust from his boots in the long grass, and rest
himself for a few minutes in a secluded place.</p>

<p>At length he rose; and his wandering footsteps led
him into the vicinity of the detached rows of small
houses and cottages which dot the immediate neighbourhood
of the Caledonian Road.</p>

<p>Once he stopped beneath a lamp; and taking his
money from his pocket, counted it slowly. And
heaven knows that the amount of his pecuniary property
did not require long to reckon; for two shillings
in silver and a few halfpence constituted all the store.</p>

<p>“This will at least purchase me a meal and procure
me a bed for to-night,” he murmured to himself;
“and then&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;I must present myself to
those who have not heard of me for so long a time.”</p>

<p>With these words, the old man resumed his slow
and painful walk&mdash;for he was wearied and exhausted
by the length of his day’s journey. It was evident
that he had been absent many&mdash;many years from the
capital; for, though he had once known this neighbourhood
well, yet now it was so changed that he
gazed around him with astonishment,&mdash;aye, and paused
to gaze around, too,&mdash;streets, rows of houses, and
gardens having taken the place of the open fields.</p>

<p>He had now reached a spot where the dwellings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
were more thinly scattered, and where the path was
as yet unpaved and the road was thickly strown with
flints.</p>

<p>It was now close upon nine o’clock; but the July
evening was so beautiful that it was far from dark&mdash;only
dimly obscure;&mdash;and thus, though there was no
lamp in the neighbourhood where the old man was
pursuing his way, yet was it sufficiently light for him
to obtain a good view of objects, and even of the
countenances of the few people whom he met.</p>

<p>Not that he paid any particular attention to the
latter:&mdash;still, a stranger just arriving in London, or a
person who returns to the capital after a very long
absence, observes and marks every thing and every
body with an earnest scrutiny at first.</p>

<p>The old man was passing by two small houses,
forming one isolated building, and standing back from
the road, when he encountered an individual whose
face immediately struck him as being one which he
had formerly known full well; and in the next instant
a light flashed in upon his mind.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;’tis he!” he ejaculated to himself; and,
laying his hand upon the other’s shoulder, he said,
“Mr. Howard, we meet at last&mdash;after a separation of
upwards of nineteen years!”</p>

<p>“My name is not Howard&mdash;and I know nothing of
you, sir. Let me go!” was the impatient reply,
delivered by the individual whom the old man had
accosted, and who was himself well stricken in years&mdash;being
now midway between sixty and seventy.</p>

<p>“Were I on my death bed, I could swear that your
name was <em>once</em> Howard, and that you were an attorney
in London&mdash;an attorney who absconded, ruining thousands,”
exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>“What means this insolence?” asked the other,
affecting a tone of deep indignation mingled with
surprise. “Pass on your way, sir&mdash;and let me pursue
mine!”</p>

<p>“Not till I have had recompense or vengeance,”
growled the old man, ferociously. “For a sum of
money did I sell myself to a vile and abandoned
woman&mdash;a certain Mrs. Slingsby, whom you knew
well;&mdash;and this money was deposited with you, villain
that you are! For you fled&mdash;and the loss of
that money was not the lightest of the myriad misfortunes
that fell upon me at the time. Now do you
know who <em>I</em> am, Mr. Howard?&mdash;for I know <em>you</em> full
well!”</p>

<p>“You have spoken of a number of unintelligible
things to me, sir&mdash;mentioned names with which I
never was acquainted&mdash;alluded to circumstances entirely
unknown&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Liar!” ejaculated Mr. Torrens&mdash;for he was the old
man who had just now so wearily entered the suburb
of Pentonville: “liar!” he repeated, seizing the other
individual by the collar; “what should prevent me
from raising an alarm and giving you into custody?
For though years have elapsed, yet your offences have
never been expiated&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Softly&mdash;softly, my good sir,” interrupted the person
thus addressed, and whose manner began to evince
trepidation and alarm. “Let us adjourn somewhere
and talk amicably on this matter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Mr. Torrens. “How do I know but
that you intend to inveigle me into a den where you
may perhaps silence my tongue for ever?”</p>

<p>“Fool&mdash;dotard!” muttered the other between his
lips: “does he take me for a murderer?”</p>

<p>“I believe you to be capable of any villainy,” returned
the now infuriated Torrens, whose ears had
caught the sense of those low mutterings. “But I
shall not lose sight of you until I have received full
and complete satisfaction for the wrongs I endured at
your hands many years ago. And that you <em>are</em> able
to give such satisfaction, your appearance proves full
well,” he added, as his eye caught a glimpse of the
gold chain and massive seals which depended from
the other’s fob.</p>

<p>“Mr. Torrens&mdash;I will no longer attempt to conceal a
fact of which you are so well assured. I <em>am</em> the Howard
to whom you allude: but, in the name of God! do not
ruin me&mdash;do not expose me. Here&mdash;this is my dwelling,”
he continued, pointing to one of the two houses
in front of which this colloquy took place: “walk in
with me&mdash;and&mdash;and we will converse at our ease&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I will accompany you,” said Mr. Torrens,
in a laconic manner: “lead the way, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Howard drew forth a small key from his pocket,
and with it opened the iron gate of the railings in front
of the house. Torrens followed him across the little
enclosure; and with another and larger key he opened
the door of the dark and gloomy-looking dwelling.
No domestic appeared; and the lawyer, entering the
parlour, groped about in the dark until he found some
lucifer-matches&mdash;Torrens remaining all the while in
the passage. At length a light was obtained; and
the visitor was requested to enter the room, which, by
means of the one poor candle that now threw a feeble
gleam around, appeared to be but indifferently furnished,&mdash;so
that the aspect of the small and cheerless
house somewhat damped the hopes which Torrens had
entertained of compelling the individual whom he had
thus accidentally encountered, to disgorge the sum
embezzled by him upwards of nineteen years previously.</p>

<p>“Do you live all alone here?” he demanded, taking
the seat to which Howard pointed.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;all alone,” was the reply. “I am too poor
to keep a servant.”</p>

<p>“Too poor!” exclaimed Mr. Torrens, his heart sinking
within him.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! How should I be possessed of any
money?” said Howard, glancing around with nervous
anxiety, as if he were afraid of being overheard.
“From the moment that I was forced, by unexpected
reverses and sudden misfortunes, to fly from London,
I have led a life of continued struggles; and although,
a few years ago, I was venturous enough to return to
the metropolis and settle in this little cottage, which I
got at a cheap rent as it was only just built,&mdash;yet my
affairs have not improved&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you must have some means of subsistence?&mdash;you
pursue some avocation?&mdash;you doubtless continue
to practise&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” interrupted Howard, hastily. “I have
been compelled to change my name&mdash;and it is as Mr.
Percival&mdash;<em>poor Mr. Percival</em>&mdash;that I am known in
this neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“You adopt strange precautions for a poor man,”
said Torrens, pointing to the strong iron bars that
fastened the shutters of the window: then, turning
a look full of sardonic meaning upon Howard&mdash;or
Percival, as we shall call him,&mdash;he added, “And methinks
that when you opened your front door just now,
a heavy chain rattled. Assuredly your little house is
well protected.”</p>

<p>“What would you infer from these facts?” demanded
Percival: “that I have money&mdash;that I have
turned miser?” he cried, with a forced and unnatural
laugh. “Absurd! The person who lived here before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
me, had those bars put up to the window-shutters,
and that heavy chain to the street door&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I thought you got the house cheap because it had
only just been built?” said Torrens, smiling with
malignant incredulity.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but I did not tell you that I was the first
person who occupied it,” exclaimed Percival, as if
eager to explain away an inconsistency in his statements
and efface from the mind of his visitor the disagreeable
impression made there.</p>

<p>“This is mere child’s play, Mr. Howard&mdash;or Percival&mdash;or
whatever your name may be!” cried Torrens.
“You have got money&mdash;and you wish me to
believe you poor. For myself, I <em>am</em> poor&mdash;so poor
that I have but wherewith to obtain a meal and a
bed for one night. It is true that I have a daughter
and a son-in-law in London;&mdash;and it is likewise true
that necessity&mdash;stern, imperious necessity has driven
me at last to this city to seek assistance at their
hands. But for nine years have I remained as one
dead to them: for nine years have I wandered about
the world, caring not what might become of me, and
wishing to be believed dead in all reality by my
daughter who suspects that I have been very criminal,
and by my son-in-law who knows that I have! Yes&mdash;yes:
I have purposely left them in uncertainty relative
to me&mdash;unhappy man that I am,&mdash;purposely left them
so, I say, in order that they may apprehend the worst!
Stern want, however, was driving me to them when
I encountered you: to-morrow morning I should have
appeared in their presence,&mdash;in the presence of the
daughter whom I do not love, and of her husband
whom I hate&mdash;<em>hate</em>, for his very virtues, and because
he knows me to be so vile!” added the old man, bitterly.
“But now, sir, that I have met with you,
your purse must save me the pain&mdash;the humiliation&mdash;the
annoyance of encountering those beings face to
face! Come, Mr. Percival&mdash;I have spoken to you
frankly: do you be equally candid with me.”</p>

<p>“Candid in what?” demanded the individual thus
addressed.</p>

<p>“In respect to your own means and resources,” returned
Torrens. “I do not wish to be hard upon you;
but a portion of the money that you robbed me of, I
must and will have.”</p>

<p>“These are harsh words&mdash;and unavailing, too,” said
Percival: “for I have not a sixpence to bless myself
with! But,” he added, with a malicious grin, “if I
cannot give you money, I may perhaps impart a piece
of agreeable intelligence.”</p>

<p>“What! to me?” exclaimed Torrens, in a tone of
surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;to you. What would you think if I were to
tell you that your dearly-beloved wife was in London
at this very moment, and passing under the aristocratic
name of Fitzhardinge?”</p>

<p>“My wife!” repeated Torrens, turning positively
livid as these words struck upon his ears. “No&mdash;impossible!
I would not meet that dreadful woman for
thousands of pounds!”</p>

<p>“Then if you remain here you will assuredly encounter
her,” said Percival; “for I received a note
from her this evening announcing her intention to
honour me with a visit,” he added, intently watching
the effect which these words produced upon his companion.</p>

<p>“Villain! you are endeavouring to get rid of me as
speedily as possible!” cried Torrens, almost foaming
at the mouth with rage.</p>

<p>“Should you recognise your wife’s handwriting?”
demanded Percival, a diabolical grin still distorting
features which, once handsome, had been marred and
rendered repulsive by time and evil passions. “Though
she is now stricken in years and has become positively
hideous in personal appearance, that handwriting retains
all the grace and fluency which ever characterised
it.”</p>

<p>With these words, he took a perfumed note from
his pocket-book, and handed it to Torrens, who, hastily
glancing over its contents, read the following words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mrs. Fitzhardinge presents her compliments to Mr. Percival,
and will call upon him between nine and ten o’clock
this evening on very particular business. She therefore
hopes that Mr. Percival will have the kindness to remain at
home to receive her.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“Now are you satisfied?” demanded Percival, who
perceived by the workings of Torrens’ countenance
that the handwriting had been fully recognised.</p>

<p>“And on what matters is she&mdash;that vile woman&mdash;coming
to you?” asked Torrens, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I cannot answer the question. You perceive that
she speaks only of <em>particular business</em> in a vague
fashion. I met her by accident some few days ago&mdash;and
have not seen her since.”</p>

<p>“And she comes between nine and ten,” mused
Torrens: “and it is already close upon ten o’clock! I
would not meet her for the world: ’twould recall to
my mind, with intolerable force, all the anguish&mdash;all
the sufferings&mdash;&mdash;No&mdash;no,” he cried, suddenly interrupting
himself and starting from his chair; “I will
not&mdash;I cannot meet her!”</p>

<p>“Then you had better depart at once,” said Percival,
evidently most anxious to see the unwelcome visitor
turn his back upon the house.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I shall depart indeed,” exclaimed Torrens:
“but you must give me money first. Nay&mdash;no more
excuses: I am a desperate man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that instant a double knock at the street door
echoed through the little dwelling.</p>

<p>“’Tis your wife!” said Percival.</p>

<p>“Hide me&mdash;or let me escape,” cried Torrens, manifesting
a violent and most unfeigned reluctance to
encounter the woman whom for so many reasons he
loathed and abhorred.</p>

<p>“Here&mdash;by the back gate,” said Percival; and,
taking the light in his hand, he hastily conducted the
almost bewildered Torrens along the passage&mdash;down a
few steps&mdash;and thence to a door opening upon a piece
of unenclosed waste ground at the back of the house.</p>

<p>At that instant the double knock was repeated&mdash;more
loudly than before and evidently with impatience.</p>

<p>“Good night, Mr. Torrens,” said Percival, scarcely
able to subdue a spice of lurking satire in his tone.</p>

<p>“Good night,” returned the other, savagely. “But
I shall visit you again to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Percival closed the back gate as if to shut out this
intimation from his ears; and, hurrying to the front
door, he gave admittance to Perdita and her mother.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXVIII">CHAPTER CXXXVIII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE MONEY-LENDER.</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. and Miss Fitzhardinge were attired in the
plainest possible manner, so that they seemed to be
some poor tradesman’s wife and daughter. But the
moment the light of the candle fell on Perdita’s countenance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
Mr. Percival literally started as the glorious
beauty of that face was revealed to him. The young
woman perceived the effect of her charms on the old
lawyer; and a smile of triumph played on her haughty
lip,&mdash;for she said within herself; “Wherever I go, men
pay homage to my loveliness!”</p>

<p>Hastily closing the front door, Percival now conducted
his two visitresses into the back-parlour, which
was far more commodiously furnished than the one
where his interview with Torrens had taken place.
The shutters of this room were, however, as strongly
protected by iron bars and as well secured as those in
the other; and Mr. Percival had multiplied in them
the number of holes cut in the shape of a heart, in
order that he might be enabled to fire his blunderbuss
at a moment’s warning, and in almost any direction,
through the shutters, in case of an attempt on the
part of burglars to effect an entry in the rear of the
building.</p>

<p>For it was perfectly true, as he had informed Torrens,
that he lived alone in the house: but he was
reported to be a miser&mdash;and such indeed he was.
Having been extravagant and profligate in his earlier
years, he had fallen into the opposite extreme; and
when he absconded from his creditors, the money which
he had taken with him he hoarded carefully. For a
long time he had remained concealed in a distant town,
placing out his funds in small loans at an enormous
interest; so that as his wealth augmented, his parsimonious
habits increased. At last, become greedy and
griping as any miser whose renown has been preserved
in tale-book or history, Percival&mdash;as we shall
continue to call him&mdash;resolved on venturing to London,
where the field for his cupidity was more ample than
in the provinces. Trusting to the alteration that years
had made in his personal appearance, and to the disguise
of the name which he had assumed, he settled
in the secluded neighbourhood and comparatively
lonely house when we now find him;&mdash;and, without
seeking business obtrusively, he soon found plenty.
One person whom he obliged with a loan would give
his address to another also requiring assistance; and
thus his clients or patrons&mdash;whichever the reader may
choose to call the borrowers&mdash;increased. He was
almost constantly at home&mdash;formed no acquaintances&mdash;and
was short and pithy in his mode of transacting
business. He never advanced money save when he
perceived the security to be ample; and if occasionally
he made a bad debt, he employed an attorney who
asked no impertinent questions to sue the defaulter in
his own name, it being alleged that the unpaid bill had
been passed in a legitimate manner to the pettifogger
aforesaid. An elderly widow, of the name of Dyer,
occupied the house next door; and she acted in the
capacity of charwoman for Mr. Percival&mdash;keeping his
dwelling in order and preparing for him his frugal
meals.</p>

<p>Having recorded these few necessary particulars, we
shall now return to the little back parlour, where Mr.
Percival and his two visitresses were seated. His
back was turned to the window: but Mrs. Fitzhardinge
and Perdita, who sate opposite to him, faced it,&mdash;while
the candle stood on the mantel,&mdash;so that had
any one peeped through the heart-holes in the shutters,
the countenances of the women must have been plainly
visible to such curious observer outside the casement.</p>

<p>“Your daughter, madam, I presume?” said Mr.
Percival, with a polite inclination of the head towards
the handsome Perdita.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear sir,” was the reply. “And she is
about to form an excellent match with a young gentleman
who is indeed a nobleman by right, and who will
shortly assert his title to that distinction. He wishes
to borrow money for his immediate purposes and also
to assist me: hence my visit to you this evening.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well, my dear madam,” said Percival; “if
the security be good&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The security is ample,” returned Mrs. Fitzhardinge.
“He is indubitably the heir to vast estates&mdash;and his
bond&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will be quite sufficient,” added Percival. “That
is&mdash;presuming him to be of age&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He is twenty-five years old,” said Mrs. Fitzhardinge.
“But the history of himself and family is most extraordinary:
and his father is not altogether unknown
to you:&mdash;for, if I remember aright, it was you who
prosecuted the celebrated highwayman, Thomas Rainford,
for the robbery of the late Sir Christopher Blunt?”</p>

<p>“What earthly connexion can exist between Tom
Rain and the young nobleman who wants to borrow
money?” demanded Percival, with unfeigned astonishment.</p>

<p>“Grant me your patience, my dear sir,” said Mrs.
Fitzhardinge, “and I will explain the matter as concisely
as possible. Thomas Rainford was in reality the
son of the late Earl of Ellingham&mdash;the eldest son, and
legitimately born, of that nobleman, who privately
married a certain Octavia Manners. The individual
who at present bears the title and enjoys the estates
of the Earldom of Ellingham, is the offspring of a
second marriage contracted by his father. He and
Rainford are consequently half-brothers. All these
facts are proven by certain papers now in the possession
of myself and daughter. One of the documents
is the marriage-certificate of the late Earl with
Octavia Manners,&mdash;another the baptismal certificate of
their son,&mdash;a third the journal of Octavia Manners explaining
many matters connected with the whole affair,&mdash;and
then follows a variety of documents establishing
the identity of Thomas Rainford with the son of the
late Earl and the Countess Octavia. Thus far the
rights of Thomas Rainford are clearly made out. I
must now inform you that Rainford and Lady Georgiana
Hatfield have long been united in matrimonial
bonds, and that the husband has for a considerable time
adapted his wife’s name. The offspring of this alliance
is the young gentleman of whom I have already
spoken to you, and who at present bears the denomination
of Charles Hatfield. Now, his father being the
rightful Earl of Ellingham, this Charles Hatfield is
actually the Viscount Marston, and heir to the title
and estates of the Earldom.”</p>

<p>“Your history, my dear madam, is clear and comprehensive
enough,” said Percival, already calculating
the enormous gains which might be derived from the
fact of becoming the banker to a young noblemen
having a vast fortune in the perspective, and whom he
supposed to be as extravagantly inclined as youthful
scions of the aristocracy in such cases generally are.
“And you possess the proofs of all the singular facts
which you have detailed?”</p>

<p>“The proofs&mdash;the positive proofs,” replied Mrs. Fitzhardinge,
emphatically;&mdash;and turning towards her
daughter, she said, “Show Mr. Percival the papers.”</p>

<p>“It is useless,” answered Perdita, in a firm but
quiet manner, “unless he first agree to advance a certain
sum of money, should they be satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“True,” said her mother, biting her lip at the
thought that her daughter was more keen than herself:
then, addressing herself to the miser, she observed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
“You heard the remark that fell from the lips of Miss
Fitzhardinge?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” returned Mr. Percival. “We shall
most likely do business together&mdash;most likely,” he repeated.
“At the same time, I must see my way very
clearly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And we must be careful not to reveal unnecessarily
any more of the important secrets of which we are the
depositories,” said Perdita.</p>

<p>“Quite right, young lady!” exclaimed the miser,
who experienced no slight degree of embarrassment:
for he was afraid, on the one hand, of letting a good
chance slip through his fingers&mdash;and he was fearful,
on the other, of admitting that he had ample resources
immediately available.</p>

<p>Not that Percival dreaded on the part of Mrs. Fitzhardinge
the same attempt at extortion, or rather of obtaining
restitution, which had been made by Mr. Torrens;
because he knew full well that she was occupying
a false position in the world, and living under an assumed
name as well as himself;&mdash;and should she take it into
her head to threaten him with an exposure as being no
other than Howard the run-away attorney, he could
in a moment retaliate by proclaiming her to be Mrs.
Slingsby&mdash;or Mrs. Torrens&mdash;the woman who had been
transported for forgery!</p>

<p>No:&mdash;Mr. Percival dreaded not menace on the part
of Mrs. Fitzhardinge; but the naturally suspicious
disposition of the miser, and the vague fears that ever
haunt the avaricious man when questioned as to the
amount and whereabouts of his resources&mdash;these were
the influences which made Percival hesitate to plunge
too precipitately into the transaction now submitted
for his consideration.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,&mdash;are you prepared to negociate with us&mdash;or
not?” demanded Perdita, after a short pause,
during which the miser fidgetted nervously upon his
chair.</p>

<p>“It all depends, Miss&mdash;it all depends on the amount
your noble friend requires,” he answered at length.</p>

<p>“The entire business is left in our hands,” said Mrs.
Fitzhardinge; “and we wish to raise between five and
six thousand pounds in the first instance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of which one thousand must be paid to-night,”
added Perdita, “as an earnest that the transaction is
seriously entered into.”</p>

<p>“A thousand pounds to-night!” cried the miser.
“But how is that possible&mdash;even if I had the money
in the house,” he asked, looking anxiously around,
and sinking his voice to a low whisper,&mdash;“how is it
possible, I say, since the young nobleman is not here
to give me any acknowledgment?”</p>

<p>“This objection was naturally anticipated by us,”
replied Perdita. “Viscount Marston, instead of sending
us the papers this evening, did us the honour to
call personally with them; and his lordship confided
to me,&mdash;and to <em>me</em> alone,” added Perdita, with a rapid
glance of triumphant meaning at her mother,&mdash;“his
note of hand for one thousand guineas.”</p>

<p>“I must congratulate you, my dear madam,” exclaimed
Percival, addressing himself with a smile to
the old woman,&mdash;“I must congratulate you on possessing
a daughter of the most business-like character
in the person of Miss Fitzhardinge.”</p>

<p>“Then pray let us transact our present affairs in a
business-like manner,” said Perdita, who was rapidly
putting herself more forward in the matter, and proportionately
throwing her mother into the back-ground:
so that the old woman more than once bit her lip to
restrain her rising choler;&mdash;but, remembering the
terrific scene of the morning, she saw no alternative
save to allow her daughter to have her own way&mdash;trusting,
however, to the chapter of accidents to restore
to her in the long run that paramount influence
which she had lost.</p>

<p>“You wish me to discount at once that note of hand
for a thousand guineas?” said the miser, fixing his
eyes admiringly on Perdita’s splendid countenance.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;as an earnest that you are not prompted by
mere curiosity to look farther into this most extraordinary,
mysterious, and yet easily understood affair,”
replied Perdita.</p>

<p>“I will accede to your terms, Miss Fitzhardinge,”
said Percival, after a few minutes’ deliberation,&mdash;“provided
that the documents in your possession bear out
your mother’s statements.”</p>

<p>“Place the money on the table, sir,” returned the
young woman, in her quiet though somewhat imperious
manner; “and these papers,” she added, producing
a sealed packet at the some time, “shall be
submitted to your perusal.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the miser.</p>

<p>He then rose from his seat; and, having once more
cast a furtive look around him, as if it were possible
for an intruder to secrete himself in a room fourteen
feet by ten, and which the three inmates already
nearly filled, he proceeded to open an iron safe that
was fitted into a kind of cupboard in one corner.
Thence he took forth a tin cash-box, which, when
opened, revealed heaps of Bank-notes, and a large
amount in gold.</p>

<p>“There, ladies,” said he: “I have now convinced
you of my ability to proceed farther in this transaction;
and it is your turn, Miss,” he added, looking at Perdita,
“to take the next step.”</p>

<p>“Granted!” was the reply; and, opening the packet,
she handed the several papers, which were properly
classed and numbered, one by one to the miser,&mdash;receiving
back each before she gave him the next following.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival read the documents without much
emotion. His pecuniary avocations had blunted the
sentiment of curiosity in his soul: he viewed the
matter only in a business-light;&mdash;and so long as the
security was good, he cared not if all the highwaymen
in the world should turn out to be noblemen in their
own right. He thought of the profits that might
arise from ministering to the extravagances, as he
supposed, of a young nobleman having excellent certainties
in the perspective; and it was not of the
slightest importance to him how Mrs. Fitzhardinge
and Perdita had contrived to inveigle him into their
meshes&mdash;how they had gotten possession of the papers&mdash;or
how the money raised was to be expended.</p>

<p>“This is completely satisfactory as far as it goes,”
he said, returning to the young woman the last paper
which she had placed in his hand. “The documents
show that Rainford is the real Earl of Ellingham; but
there is no evidence to prove that your Charles Hatfield
is his son.”</p>

<p>“We are well convinced of that fact,” said Mrs.
Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I suppose it may be admitted,” observed
Percival, who had not the least idea that Charles
Hatfield had ever passed and was still passing as the
nephew of those whose were really his parents. “But
there is still one question which must be fully cleared
up;&mdash;and this is the legitimacy of the young man’s
birth. If he be the lawfully begotten son of the rightful
owner of the title and estates of the Earldom&mdash;then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
is he the heir, beyond all possibility of doubt:
but if he be illegitimate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The idea is absurd,” interrupted Mrs. Fitzhardinge.
“There can be no hesitation in declaring that Thomas
Rainford and Lady Georgiana had been privately
married long before the man himself was condemned
to death: else wherefore should she have exerted her
interest to obtain a pardon for him at the hand of
George the Fourth?”</p>

<p>“I remember the transaction,” said Percival; “and
I have no moral doubt that all you tell me is perfectly
correct. Indeed, I am so well assured of it, that I
have not the least objection to discount the note of
hand, on condition that the defective evidence be
supplied me before I am called upon to make further
advances.”</p>

<p>“Most certainly,” exclaimed Perdita. “Charles
will give you every satisfactory proof of the validity
of his claims. You require testimony to show that
he is the lawfully begotten son of those who now pass
under the name of Mr. and Lady Georgiana Hatfield?”</p>

<p>“The certificates of <em>their</em> marriage and <em>his</em> birth,”
said the miser. “Where is the note of hand?”</p>

<p>Perdita produced it; and a little altercation then
arose respecting the rate of discount. Mrs. Fitzhardinge
manifested a greedy anxiety to conclude the
bargain on the miser’s own exorbitant terms: but
Perdita argued the point with him in a resolute manner.
At last, however, an amicable understanding
was arrived at; and the miser was permitted to deduct
seventy-five pounds for the discount. Perdita received
the amount which he then told down upon the table;
and the old woman’s features grew distorted with rage&mdash;a
rage the more intense, because she was forced to
restrain it&mdash;when she found that her daughter did
not offer to render her the guardian of the purse.</p>

<p>But Perdita had that day asserted an empire which
she was resolved to maintain&mdash;a domination which
she was determined to grasp indivisibly. Without
positively offending or irritating her mother by
pointed and overt insult, she nevertheless had made
up her mind to act as the mistress in all things;&mdash;and
thus had the punishment of the vile old woman
already begun, even on account of the new schemes
of wickedness which she had set on foot.</p>

<p>Having secured the precious packet of papers and
the money about her person, the beautiful Perdita
rose from her chair, saying, “We may now take our
departure, mother.”</p>

<p>“One word first!” exclaimed Percival, a sudden
reminiscence striking him: then, turning towards
Mrs. Fitzhardinge, he said, “My dear madam, I have
some news to impart which I had almost forgotten in
the absorbing nature of the business that has occupied
us for the last hour,&mdash;news which will not a little
astonish you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then pray keep me no longer in suspense!” exclaimed
Mrs. Fitzhardinge, Perdita’s conduct not
having put her into the best of possible humours.</p>

<p>“Just before you knocked at the door this night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, well?” ejaculated the impatient woman.</p>

<p>“A man was with me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And that man?” repeated Mrs. Fitzhardinge, gasping
for breath, as if she anticipated the reply.</p>

<p>“Was your husband!” added the miser.</p>

<p>A hideous expression passed over the countenance
of Mrs. Fitzhardinge,&mdash;an expression of mingled hate,
apprehension, and rage; and she staggered for a moment
as if she were about to fall.</p>

<p>But subduing her emotions, she approached the
miser, and said in a low, hoarse, grating tone, “Does
he know that I am in London?&mdash;is he aware that I am
in England&mdash;passing by the name of Fitzhardinge&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” replied Percival hastily: for he saw by
the old woman’s manner that she would not thank
him were he to inform her that he had made her husband
acquainted with so many particulars concerning
her.</p>

<p>“You are sure&mdash;you are certain?” demanded she,
breathing somewhat more freely.</p>

<p>“Since Mr. Percival has already answered you
satisfactorily, mother, wherefore require additional
assurances?” said Perdita, who was in haste to depart&mdash;for
it was now waxing very late.</p>

<p>“Because I would sooner meet one of those hideous
snakes that I have seen in Australia, than encounter
that man!” responded the old woman. “I know not
why,&mdash;but I hate him&mdash;I loathe and abhor him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come along, mother,” interrupted Perdita, impatiently:
“Mr. Percival cares nothing about all
this.”</p>

<p>“True! but one word more,” cried Mrs. Fitzhardinge.
“Tell me, sir&mdash;is that man&mdash;<em>my husband</em>,”&mdash;and
the words appeared almost to choke her,&mdash;“is
he well off&mdash;or poor and wretched?”</p>

<p>“He seemed to be very miserable,” answered the
miser;&mdash;“so miserable that he wished to obtain
assistance from me! But I&mdash;I never give,” he added,
after a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“I believe you, sir,” remarked Perdita, a faint smile
of contempt curling her haughty but beauteous lip.
“Now, mother, at last you are ready, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Allow me to light you to the door,” said Percival;
and, with a bow, he preceded the two females into the
passage.</p>

<p>He opened the front door, and Perdita, wishing him
“good night” bounded forth first into the open air&mdash;for
she felt relieved at escaping from the miser’s cheerless
abode:&mdash;her mother followed more slowly&mdash;and
just as she passed by Percival, who stood on the
threshold officiously holding the candle, the light
streamed fully on the countenance of the old woman.
At that same instant Mrs. Dyer&mdash;the widow who
lived at the next house&mdash;was returning home from a
neighbour’s; and she caught a complete view of the
face of Mrs. Fitzhardinge. It struck the good woman
at the moment that she had seldom beheld such a
repulsive, sinister countenance: but she was accustomed
to see strange-looking people visit the miser’s
abode;&mdash;and the circumstance therefore made no particular
impression on her mind.</p>

<p>She merely said “Good night, sir,” to the miser,
and forthwith entered her own abode.</p>

<p>Percival’s door closed at the same instant; and Mrs.
Fitzhardinge having overtaken her daughter, the two
retraced their way to the City Road, whence they took a
cab to Suffolk Street.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXXXIX">CHAPTER CXXXIX.<br />

<span class="medium">THE MISER ALONE IN HIS DWELLING.</span></h2>

<p>Having carefully barred and bolted the street-door,
Percival entered the front room, and assured himself
that the shutters were safely fastened.</p>

<p>He then returned to the back parlour; and, seating
himself at the table, proceeded to examine the contents
of his cash-box.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<div id="i_113" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>He looked at the note of hand which he had received
that night, and which bore the signature of
<em>Marston</em>&mdash;for, in compliance with the suggestion of
Mrs. Fitzhardinge, the infatuated Charles Hatfield had
signed the document with the name to which he
believed himself to be entitled.</p>

<p>The first sensations of the miser, as he fixed his eyes
on the “promise to pay” at a specific date the sum of
<em>one thousand guineas</em>, were of pleasure: for he calculated
the profit he had derived from the transaction&mdash;and
he flattered himself that he had gained seventy
guineas in a single hour.</p>

<p>“And with so little trouble, too,” he muttered to
himself.</p>

<p>But, in the next moment, a gloomy shade began
to cross his countenance: for the thought stole upon
him that perhaps he had acted too precipitately&mdash;that
the women might have forged a number of papers to
delude him&mdash;that, after all, there might be no such
person in existence as Charles Hatfield, or Viscount
Marston.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” he exclaimed emphatically, as he endeavoured
to banish these unpleasant reflections from
his mind; “it is all right&mdash;and I am a fool thus to
yield to misgivings. Why should not Tom Rain
be the rightful Earl of Ellingham? Things more
strange and improbable have occurred in this world.
And if he be really the elder brother of the nobleman
now bearing the title, why should he not have a son
who is the heir to that title and likewise to the estates?
Yes&mdash;yes: it is all feasible enough! Besides, amongst
those papers were the marriage certificate of the late
Earl and Octavia Manners&mdash;and the baptismal certificate
of their child. Well, then&mdash;granting that
there is a Charles Hatfield,&mdash;or, in other words, a
Viscount Marston,&mdash;what is less extraordinary than
that so beautiful a creature as this Miss Fitzhardinge
should have captivated the young noble? She is a
splendid girl&mdash;a very splendid girl! Even in the
plain garb which she wore this evening&mdash;a sort of disguise,
no doubt&mdash;she looked truly bewitching. What
eyes!&mdash;what a profile!&mdash;what teeth!&mdash;what hair!
Ah! I wish that I was a young man now&mdash;that I had
not these sixty-five winters on my head: I would
even yet endeavour to rival Viscount Marston! But,
no&mdash;no: that were impossible! These young girls
are smitten with titles more than with money: and, on
my honour, Miss Fitzhardinge will become the rank of
Viscountess full well. She has the dignity&mdash;the stateliness&mdash;and
yet the grace and elegance of a woman of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
fashion! All this, doubtless, must be the work of
nature: for where could she have become familiar with
the manners and customs of the drawing-room? Ah!
was not that a noise?”</p>

<p>And the miser, hastily shutting up his cash-box,
started to his feet.</p>

<p>He listened&mdash;but all was still!</p>

<p>“A false alarm,” he murmured to himself&mdash;and resumed
his seat.</p>

<p>But the incident had completely disturbed the current
of his thoughts which were flowing into a more
voluptuous channel than for years and years they had
done,&mdash;the beauty of Perdita having made a deep impression
upon the mind of the miser, and for a few
minutes weaned away his attention from the hitherto
all-absorbing gold that he worshipped so devotedly.</p>

<p>And now that alarm,&mdash;whether false or real, we
cannot as yet determine,&mdash;recalled his errant thoughts
to the one engrossing subject: and carefully depositing
his cash-box in the safe, he next secured the safe
itself.</p>

<p>Then, having placed the key in his pocket, he took
the candle in his hand, and once more inspected the
street-door&mdash;the shutters in the front-room&mdash;and the
bolt of the back-gate.</p>

<p>He descended into the kitchen,&mdash;that kitchen which
no domestic occupied, and the hearth of which so seldom
sparkled or shone with blazing coal or wood,&mdash;a
cursed hearth which, even in the very midst of summer,
seemed cheerless and cold! The area that gave
light to the kitchen-window was strongly barred over:
the window itself was likewise barred;&mdash;and the door
opening into the area was well secured with bolts and
chains.</p>

<p>All these multiplied precautions were duly inspected
by the miser. Forgotten now was the image of Perdita:&mdash;gold&mdash;gold&mdash;<em>his</em>
gold,&mdash;this was the one absorbing
idea!</p>

<p>No&mdash;not the only <em>one</em>: for with the thought of possessing
gold is ever associated the dread of losing it;&mdash;and
at this moment the man’s mind was a prey to
vague fears&mdash;undefined alarms&mdash;gloomy misgivings.</p>

<p>He did not like that noise which he had heard:&mdash;it
haunted him like a spectre;&mdash;it was something that
weighed upon his soul like lead.</p>

<p>He felt&mdash;he knew that he was really <em>alone</em> in that
house,&mdash;aye, and that the house was lonely in situation
likewise: for he could not count for aid, in case of
need, on the elderly widow next door and her two or
three poor female lodgers. Thus, the fact that there
<em>was</em> a house adjoining did not detract from the sense
of utter loneliness awakened in his mind respecting his
own abode.</p>

<p>But were not the bolts secure&mdash;the chains fastened&mdash;the
bars all firm and strong? Oh! he had not
spared his money to obtain the best iron and the best
work when those precautions were adopted: and, since
he had become a miser, he had never paid a bill so
cheerfully as that which the defences of his dwelling
had incurred.</p>

<p>Yes:&mdash;the bolts <em>were</em> secure&mdash;the chains <em>were</em> well
fastened&mdash;and the bars <em>were</em> all firm and strong;&mdash;and
yet Percival was not at ease in his mind.</p>

<p>That unknown, unaccountable noise had alarmed
him. It was a noise the nature of which he could
scarcely explain to himself,&mdash;nor whether it had occurred
inside or outside the house: no&mdash;nor whether
it were the creaking of timber&mdash;or the shaking of the
shutters&mdash;or the sound of a human voice speaking
low, hoarse, and in a disguised tone.</p>

<p>Having convinced himself that all was secure in
the kitchen and the little scullery at the back, Percival
once more ascended to his back parlour. He looked
at his watch, and found it was half an hour past midnight:&mdash;still
he felt no inclination to sleep! Vague
and oppressive fears continued to haunt him;&mdash;and
the more he essayed to wrestle with his reflections, the
more intolerable did they become,&mdash;till at last horrible
ideas were forced upon his imagination,&mdash;of how misers
had been murdered for their gold&mdash;how their blood
had been poured out even on the very treasure-chests
to which they clung with desperate tenacity while the
blows of the assassins rained down upon their heads!</p>

<p>Of all these things he thought; and his brain appeared
to whirl. He cast his eyes around: objects of
terror seemed to encounter them in all directions&mdash;for
his fevered, excited imagination conjured up the most
horrifying phantoms.</p>

<p>Suddenly taking his head as it were in his hands,
and pressing it violently, he exclaimed aloud. “Perdition
take this cowardly nervousness! What have I
to fear to-night&mdash;more than any other? I need rest&mdash;repose&mdash;slumber;&mdash;and
when I awake in the morning,
I shall laugh at myself for the absurd terrors to
which I have yielded now!”</p>

<p>Taking the light in his hand, he was about to quit
the room and seek his chamber up stairs, when a
sound, as of the back door slowly opening, fell upon his
ears;&mdash;and so great was the alarm with which this
circumstance filled him,&mdash;striking him as it were with
a sudden paralysis,&mdash;that he let the candle fall upon
the floor&mdash;and the light was immediately extinguished.</p>

<p>Then there was the rush of a man up the stairs
leading from the back door to the parlour;&mdash;and in
another moment Percival was assailed in the dark,
and in a desperate manner. A heavy blow, as with a
bludgeon, felled him to the ground,&mdash;not quite stunning
him, but so far depriving him of his physical
energies that he could not even cry out. But he
grasped the murderer by the throat; and a short
struggle ensued. The assassin, however, was armed
with the determination, if not with the strength, of a
demon;&mdash;and, dashing the miser back on the floor
again with all his force, he seized the bludgeon and
wielded it with such fearful effect, that in a few instants
the victim lay motionless and silent beneath
him!</p>

<p>This fearful crime was accomplished in the dark;
and yet the murderer appeared not to be afraid&mdash;nor
to lose his presence of mind. It would also seem that
he was acquainted with the nook where the miser’s
gold was concealed: yes&mdash;even circumstances more
minute still were known to him. For, stooping down,
and passing his hand over the corpse, he felt in the very
pocket where Percival had placed the key of the cupboard
enclosing the iron safe;&mdash;and then, groping his
way to that cupboard, he opened it,&mdash;opened likewise
the iron safe,&mdash;and drew forth the tin case containing
the miser’s gold and bank-notes. Breaking open the
lid of the box, the miscreant secured all the coin,
notes, and papers about his person, and then stole away
from the dwelling by means of the back-gate, which
he closed behind him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At half-past seven o’clock in the morning, Mrs.
Dyer knocked at the door of the miser’s house, and
was somewhat surprised when, five minutes having
elapsed, her summons remained unanswered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps he has over-slept himself,” she muttered
to herself: “I will come back again presently;”&mdash;and
the woman returned to her own abode.</p>

<p>But something like a misgiving had stolen into her
mind,&mdash;a vague and indefinable fear&mdash;a presentiment
against which she could not wrestle. A gloom had
fallen on her spirits: she was in that humour when
people who are in any way superstitious, expect bad
news. Not that she had heard any noise in the course
of the night, or that she had any motive for suspicion:&mdash;the
feeling that oppressed her was excited by no
accountable and intelligible cause,&mdash;unless, indeed, it
were that during the five or six years she had waited
upon Mr. Percival, this was the very first occasion on
which she had failed to find him already up and
dressed, and ready to admit her at a stipulated hour.</p>

<p>Having performed a few domestic duties in her own
house&mdash;but in a strange manner, as if she scarcely
knew what she was doing,&mdash;Mrs. Dyer returned to the
miser’s front-door, at which she knocked again.</p>

<p>But again there was no response: all was silent.</p>

<p>The widow-woman was now seriously alarmed; and,
hastening back into her dwelling, she informed her
female lodgers that she could not make Mr. Percival
hear next door, and was afraid something had happened.
The three women, to whom these observations
were addressed, accompanied her to the miser’s house;
and as all within was still silent as the grave, they
proceeded round to the back-door with the intention
of looking in through the window shutters, which, as
we have before stated, were perforated with many
heart-holes. But Mrs. Dyer first happened to try the
back-gate, and, to her surprise, found it unfastened.
She and the other women then entered the house; and
their attention, now rendered keen by dark suspicions,
was immediately attracted to the fact that the part of
the door-post into which the bolt of the back-gate fitted,
had been cut away, <em>from the outside</em>, in such a manner
that it was an easy affair to slide back the bolt. The
females beheld this ominous appearance with dismay;&mdash;but
how shuddering were the looks of deep apprehension
which they rapidly and silently exchanged,
when they likewise noticed an old piece of iron still
sticking in the lock,&mdash;a sure indication of that lock
having been picked, also from the outside!</p>

<p>Had either one of the women now manifested the
least hesitation to proceed, the others would have
gladly followed the example to retreat. But, huddling
all together&mdash;and in deep silence&mdash;they slowly ascended
the stairs leading to the back parlour.</p>

<p>The door of this room was half open; and as the
widow endeavoured to push it farther back still, it
was stopped by something that evidently was not a
table nor a chair,&mdash;no&mdash;nor aught made of wood.</p>

<p>The women slowly entered the parlour:&mdash;and then
their tongues were suddenly loosened&mdash;and piercing
shrieks burst from their lips. For the prismatic light
which streamed through the heart-holes of the closed
shutters, played on the smashed, gory, and disfigured
countenance of the murdered man!</p>

<p>Terror for a few minutes rooted to the spot the spectatresses
of this horrible spectacle:&mdash;and, clinging&mdash;hanging
to each other, they remained gazing, in
terror and dismay, on the remains of him whom they
had all seen alive and in health on the preceding day!</p>

<p>At length the female who was nearest to the door
seemed suddenly to recover the use of her limbs; and,
with another ejaculation of horror, she fled precipitately,&mdash;her
companions following her with a haste
which seemed to indicate that they were afraid lest
the murdered man should stretch forth his hand and
clutch the hindermost by the garments.</p>

<p>Oh! what terrors are inspired by the cold&mdash;inanimate&mdash;powerless
remains of mortality! And yet men
of the strongest minds have had their fears in this
respect;&mdash;and heroes who would have faced a serried
rank bristling with bayonets, or hunted the savage
tiger in the jungles of Hindoostan, have feared to remain
alone with the corpse of a fellow-creature!</p>

<p>Full soon was the dreadful rumour spread throughout
the neighbourhood that the miser Percival had
been murdered during the night;&mdash;and the police were
speedily upon the spot.</p>

<p>The dead body indeed presented a hideous spectacle
to the view:&mdash;the countenance was so disfigured as to
defy recognition;&mdash;and the skull was fractured in
several places. By the side of the corpse lay a heavy
stake; and, as it was covered with blood, and some of
the hair from the murdered man’s head was sticking
to it, there was no difficulty in pronouncing it to have
been the weapon used by the assassin. The candlestick
was found on the floor close by;&mdash;the cupboard
and the iron safe were open;&mdash;and the tin-box, emptied
of its contents, was stumbled over by one of the
officers.</p>

<p>Not the slightest suspicion could possibly be attached
to the widow-woman or her lodgers occupying the adjacent
house;&mdash;but they were necessarily questioned
by the inspector, with a view to elicit any particulars
that might aid the officers of justice in sifting the
most mysterious and horrible affair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dyer stated that she had heard no disturbance
during the night; and her lodgers all made a similar
declaration.</p>

<p>“I passed the evening with a neighbour,” said the
widow, naming the friend at whose house she had
supped; “and I returned home about half-past eleven
o’clock. Mr. Percival was at that moment taking
leave of some visitors at his own door: and&mdash;&mdash;Oh! I
remember now,” exclaimed Mrs. Dyer, a sudden
thought striking her,&mdash;“there were two women&mdash;one
apparently young, if I might judge by the hasty glimpse
I caught of her figure&mdash;for I did not see her face, as
she was standing by the gate opening into the
road&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And the other woman?” demanded the inspector.</p>

<p>“Was old and very ugly,” returned the widow. “I
saw her countenance plainly enough; for the light
which Mr. Percival held, streamed full upon it;&mdash;and I
thought at the moment that I had never in my life
beheld such a repulsive&mdash;horrible-looking creature. I
was really frightened&mdash;there was something so unpleasant
in her looks.”</p>

<p>“And was any man with them?” enquired the
officer.</p>

<p>“No: the two women were alone. They took leave
of Mr. Percival, and, I suppose, went away. At all
events, I know that he closed his door just at the same
moment that I shut mine. I said ‘Good night’ to him:
and that was the last time I saw the poor gentleman
alive.”</p>

<p>“It is highly important,” observed the inspector,
“that we should find out these two women of whom
you speak&mdash;as they were, to all appearances, the last
persons who were with the deceased?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dyer then gave as accurate a description as
she could of the personal appearance of the old woman
whose countenance had struck her as being so repulsive
and sinister;&mdash;and the inspector, having left a
couple of officers on the premises where the crime had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
been committed, departed to acquaint the Coroner with
the dreadful occurrence.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXL">CHAPTER CXL.<br />

<span class="medium">FRESH SCENES AND MORE TROUBLES AT HOME.</span></h2>

<p>While the discovery of the assassination of the old
miser was being made in Pentonville, as just related,
a scene of some interest occurred simultaneously at the
mansion of the Earl of Ellingham, in Pall Mall.</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield had risen early, after having passed
a restless night; and, his toilette being completed, he
was just meditating&mdash;unpleasantly meditating on the
demeanour that it was proper for him to assume at
the breakfast-table,&mdash;when the door opened, and his
father entered the chamber.</p>

<p>The young man had not encountered his parents
since the dispute of the preceding morning: he had purposely
avoided them throughout the day&mdash;not appearing
at the dinner-table, and absenting himself likewise
from the usual family meeting at the supper-hour. He
therefore felt himself somewhat disagreeably situated,&mdash;being
totally unprepared to meet his father, and
having decided on no definite course to pursue with
regard to him.</p>

<p>“My dear son,” said Mr. Hatfield, approaching and
taking the young man’s hand, “it is necessary that
we should have an immediate explanation. I allude
to the occurrences of yesterday morning; and I regret
that you should have adopted the unusual course of
absenting yourself throughout the day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I returned home between seven and eight last evening,”
interrupted Charles, hastily, but not disrespectfully.</p>

<p>“I am aware of it,” said Mr. Hatfield, fixing his
eyes upon his son in a penetrating manner. “But you
only remained in the house a few minutes;&mdash;and,
having visited your chamber, you hurried away again.
Were you afraid to encounter your parents? Remember,
Charles, if you felt that your conduct of the morning
had been undutiful and improper&mdash;nay, I will even
say <em>cruel</em>, towards us&mdash;yet a single word expressive of
contrition would have made us open our arms to receive
you.”</p>

<p>“You denounce my behaviour as cruel towards you,”
exclaimed Charles: “but did you not first provoke
<em>me</em>, father?&mdash;did you not call me harsh names? And
if, in return, I complained of what I considered to be
the unnatural conduct of my parents toward me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wherefore thus pertinaciously endeavour to penetrate
into those secrets which, for good and salutary
reasons, your parents keep concealed from you?” demanded
Mr. Hatfield: “for I presume that you allude
to the fact of our still desiring that you should pass
as our nephew.”</p>

<p>“You have assured me that I am legitimate&mdash;that
there is no stigma upon my birth,” cried Charles;&mdash;“then
wherefore not acknowledge me as your son?
You claim from me the duty of a son&mdash;and yet you
deny me the title! And again I must remind you,
father, that to an accident alone am I indebted for
the knowledge of my birth!”</p>

<p>“I would ask you, Charles,” said Mr. Hatfield, in
a serious and impressive tone, “what all this has to do
with the proposal of marriage that you made to
Lady Frances Ellingham: for it was on <em>this</em> point
that our dispute commenced yesterday morning. Am
I to suppose that my son, being unwilling to contract
an alliance so honourable to him, seeks other
grounds whereon to base his design of flying in the
face of his parents?&mdash;am I to conclude that, being
resolved to thwart us in this&mdash;our dearest hope, you
seize upon another and ignoble pretext to justify your
rebellion against us!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;ten thousand times <em>No</em>!” exclaimed the
young man, cruelly hurt by these suspicions. “In
first place, I do not love Lady Frances Ellingham
otherwise than as a brother may love a sister&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Because,” interrupted Mr. Hatfield, fixing his
eyes sternly upon his son,&mdash;“because you have formed
some connexion of which you are ashamed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Charles, starting violently. “Has my
father acted the spy upon me?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Mr. Hatfield, to whose countenance
the indignant blood rushed as his son thus insolently
addressed him: but he chose to controul his feelings&mdash;and
he succeeded: “listen, Charles&mdash;and then decide
whether you ought to judge me so harshly.
Your conduct of yesterday morning towards your
mother and myself was of such an extraordinary&mdash;unaccountable&mdash;distressing
nature, that you cannot
blame me if I resolved to discover the motives that
had actuated you. In this determination I was fixed
by your protracted absence throughout the day&mdash;your
stealthy return in the evening&mdash;your short visit to
your own chamber&mdash;your avoidance of all the inmates
of this house&mdash;and your hasty and also stealthy departure
again. I confess, then, that I followed you
last evening&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You followed me, father?” repeated Charles, in a
low, hoarse, and hollow voice.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I followed you to Suffolk Street,” continued
Mr. Hatfield, with a firmness and a cool determination
of tone and manner which he hoped would overawe
the rebellious young man: “and, on inquiry in
the neighbourhood, I learnt that at the house which
you entered, dwells a very beautiful young lady.
Now, I give you my honour, Charles, that I asked no
more&mdash;was told no more than this one fact. I have no
desire to become acquainted with the <em>liaisons</em> of my
son:&mdash;indeed, I know that young men will be&mdash;what
shall we call it?&mdash;-<em>gay</em>, if you will. All I wished to
ascertain was whether there were any grounds for supposing
that you had formed a connexion which you
may believe to have <em>love</em> for its basis, and which induced
you yesterday morning to refuse the fulfilment
of your own offer to Lady Frances Ellingham.”</p>

<p>“Father,” said Charles Hatfield, scarcely able to
restrain an outburst of indignation, reproach, and
bitter recrimination,&mdash;in which, had he allowed that
torrent of feelings to force a vent, all that he knew of
his family and their secrets would have been revealed,
or rather proclaimed, in no measured terms;&mdash;“father,”
he said, fortunately subduing the evil promptings of
the moment,&mdash;“I have listened to you with attention&mdash;though
not without impatience. Yesterday you
reviled me&mdash;you heaped bitter reproaches upon me&mdash;you
menaced me with disinheritance: then, in the
evening, you enacted the spy upon my actions&mdash;you
watched me&mdash;you followed me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was my duty&mdash;and a most painful one, I can
assure you,” interrupted Mr. Hatfield, alarmed by the
strange&mdash;the ominous coldness that characterised his
son’s tone and manner.</p>

<p>“Your duty!” ejaculated Charles, now speaking
with an indignation that burst forth in frightful contrast
with the unnatural tranquillity on which it so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
abruptly broke; “and wherefore have you not performed
your duty in all things? Duty, indeed! But
know, father, that there are other duties to fulfil than
merely playing the part of a spy on your son’s actions:&mdash;there
are such duties as giving him his proper name&mdash;allowing
him to assume his just rights&mdash;and placing
him in that social position which he ought to occupy!
You menace me with the loss of fortune, father?&mdash;Oh!
you know how vain and ridiculous is this threat&mdash;and
how it aggravates the wickedness of all your
former conduct towards me! I am no longer a child
to be held in leading-strings&mdash;no longer a silly sentimentalist
who, through maudlin and mawkish feelings
of a false delicacy, will consent to have my nearest and
dearest interests trampled upon&mdash;my privileges altogether
withheld&mdash;my rights cruelly denied me! You
have played the mysterious too long,&mdash;you have enacted
the cruel and unnatural until endurance has become
impossible;&mdash;and now you would assume the part of the
absolute dictator&mdash;expecting to find me still a pliant,
docile, grovelling slave,&mdash;without spirit&mdash;without
courage&mdash;without even the common feelings of a man!
But you are mistaken, father:&mdash;and if I have thus
been driven to tell you my mind, you have only yourself
to reproach, for so distressing&mdash;so painful a scene!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking,&mdash;and before his father had so far
recovered from the amazement into which this volley
of words threw him, as to be able even to stretch out
a hand to retain him,&mdash;Charles seized his hat, and
rushed from the room.</p>

<p>In less than a minute the front-door of the house
closed behind him; and he hurried on, like one demented,
to Suffolk Street.</p>

<p>But before we accompany him thither, we must
pause to explain the effect which this scene had upon
his father.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Hatfield was struck with an astonishment
so profound&mdash;a bewilderment so complete, that
his heart seemed as if it were numbed against pain.
He could not comprehend the drift of Charles’s passionate
address,&mdash;otherwise than by supposing that
the young man required to be recognised as a son,
and not as a nephew. For it did not&mdash;as, in fact, it
could not&mdash;for a single moment enter Mr. Hatfield’s
head that Charles had discovered all the occurrences
of former years, and that he had thence drawn the
false and fatal inference that he&mdash;this same infatuated
young man&mdash;was the heir to the proud title and vast
estates of the Earldom of Ellingham. He therefore
saw in his son’s conduct only the rebellious spirit of
an individual who, having formed a connexion of which
he was most likely ashamed and which he knew to
be improper, endeavoured to meet his parents’ reproaches
with recriminations, and seize upon the least
shadow of an excuse or pretext for resisting the
paternal authority.</p>

<p>When reflection thus diminished the wonderment
which Mr. Hatfield experienced at the behaviour of
the young man, pain and sorrow succeeded that first
feeling. Indeed, the unhappy father was cruelly embarrassed:
he knew not how to act. Charles was of
that age when,&mdash;even did circumstances permit Mr.
Hatfield to acknowledge that he really was his son,&mdash;no
legal authority could be exercised, nor constraint
practised; and he felt assured that any farther attempt
to interfere with him in the connexion which
he had formed, would only aggravate the irritability
of the wrong-headed young man.</p>

<p>Then again, it was impossible to abandon him thus
to courses which might hurry him on to utter ruin;&mdash;and
moreover, the Lady Frances Ellingham had been
so cruelly trifled with, that an explanation with <em>her</em>
parents became absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Now was it that Mr. Hatfield cursed the hour when
he had been induced to leave Italy, and return to
England on this visit to his half-brother&mdash;a visit
which the Earl had by letter urged him to pay, and
to which he had assented in full confidence of the
complete safety of the step.</p>

<p>Bewildered with the variety of his conflicting
thoughts, and feeling the necessity as well as recognising
the propriety of consulting the Earl, Mr. Hatfield
repaired to the library, whence he despatched a
message to the nobleman requesting his lordship to
join him there as speedily as possible:&mdash;for it still
wanted upwards of half-an-hour to the usual breakfast
time.</p>

<p>The Earl of Ellingham was just issuing from his
chamber when the message was delivered to him; and,
immediately apprehending some evil news, he hastened
to the library, where he found his half-brother pacing
up and down in an agitated manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield, without any disguise, hesitation, or
circumlocution, immediately unfolded to the Earl all
that had taken place, both on that and the preceding
day, in respect to Charles;&mdash;and Arthur listened with
emotions of mingled pain, astonishment, and apprehension.</p>

<p>“Much as it would have delighted me,” he at
length observed, “to witness the union of my daughter
and your son, Thomas, I cannot for a moment recommend
that the young man’s inclinations should be
forced. Such an union seemed necessary&mdash;almost imperiously
necessary under the peculiar circumstances
in which we are placed. While you, the elder brother,
renounce the title which is your just right&mdash;I, the
younger one, have long borne it and bear it still;&mdash;though,
heaven knows that I value it indeed but
little&mdash;&mdash;However,” added the Earl, interrupting himself
hastily,&mdash;“I was about to observe that, situated
as we thus are, it appears but natural and proper that
your son should receive a positive and acknowledged
admission into the family by means of an alliance
with my daughter. And she, poor girl&mdash;she loves
him,” continued the nobleman, his voice faltering;
“and he has acted unwisely&mdash;to use no harsher term&mdash;in
declaring an attachment which he does not feel,
and making a proposal which he cannot accomplish.”</p>

<p>“I am at a loss how to act!” said Mr. Hatfield.
“My God!” he cried, in a tone expressive of deep
feeling, “am I ever to be the means of giving annoyance
and vexation to you, my dear Arthur,&mdash;you, who
have been so kind and generous a friend to me?”</p>

<p>“Not on <em>this</em> account must you distress yourself,
Thomas,” returned the Earl, emphatically: “you are
not responsible for the wayward humours of your son.
But surely this sudden manifestation of a rebellious
disposition on his part, cannot arise wholly and solely
from the connexion which you believe him to have
formed. Have you enquired concerning the character
of the women&mdash;the mother and daughter&mdash;whom he
visits in Suffolk-street?”</p>

<p>“No: I contented myself with ascertaining that
at the house which I saw him enter, there is a young
lady of very extraordinary beauty.”</p>

<p>“And are you convinced that Charles has learnt nothing
relative to the events of former years&mdash;nothing
calculated to diminish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand you, Arthur,” said Mr. Hatfield, seeing
that his half-brother hesitated: “you would ask
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
whether I have any reason to believe that he has learnt
aught which may have a tendency to diminish the respect
he had until within these two days past maintained
towards his parents? On this head I am of
course unable to answer you positively: but my impression
is that he is as much as ever in the dark relative
to the dread occurrences of the past. Indeed,
how can he have possibly learnt a single fact&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“May not the discovery that he is your <em>son</em>, and not
your nephew, have induced him to seek for farther information?”
enquired the Earl of Ellingham. “May
not some sentiment of ardent curiosity have been
awakened within him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But where could he address himself to this task of
raising the veil from the mysteries of by-gone years&mdash;even
if he have the slightest ground to suspect that
such mysteries do exist?” demanded Mr. Hatfield, interrupting
the Earl. “To what source could he repair
for the means of elucidation?”</p>

<p>“I know not: and yet&mdash;I am now impressed with
suspicions of a most unpleasant nature,” observed the
Earl. “It is very essential that some immediate step
should be taken to redeem this fine young man from a
career of error&mdash;perhaps of depravity&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;yes!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield. “My
God! if the sins of the father be in this case visited
upon the son, life will become intolerable to me!&mdash;Rather
would I at once have a full and complete
understanding with Charles,&mdash;tell him all&mdash;yes, <em>all</em>,&mdash;reveal
to him who I really am&mdash;open to him the means
of a complete retrospection, embracing all my sad
history,&mdash;and then throw myself on his mercy&mdash;imploring
him at least to have pity upon his innocent
mother, if not on me who am so guilty!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, Thomas: this humiliation may not be!”
ejaculated the Earl. “For if, as you believe, your
son has at present no suspicion of the past, it would
be madness to make unnecessary revelations.”</p>

<p>“I am bewildered&mdash;cruelly perplexed: I know not
how to act!” cried Mr. Hatfield. “Oh! if I were
confident that he has no such suspicions&mdash;that he has
learnt or surmised nothing calculated to diminish the
respect due to his mother and myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How can he have fathomed the obscurity which
hangs over your former life?” demanded the Earl.
“And as to supposing that he could, by any possible
means, obtain even the shadow of an idea of your real
birth and parentage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No: for the papers&mdash;those important papers which
I gave you years ago, and which I requested you to
destroy,&mdash;those papers, I say,” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield,
“could alone make such important revelations
to my son: and, thank heaven! they are not in
existence.”</p>

<p>“My dear brother,” returned the Earl of Ellingham,
taking Mr. Hatfield’s hand, and speaking in a very
serious tone, “I most frankly and honestly inform
you that those papers have <em>not</em> been destroyed. At
the same time, they have been kept in a place of perfect
security&mdash;a secret recess known only to myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And wherefore were not such dangerous documents
burnt&mdash;annihilated!” asked Mr. Hatfield, in a
reproachful tone.</p>

<p>“I dared not perform a deed which would argue so
much selfishness on my part,” replied the Earl of
Ellingham, now speaking with a strong emphasis&mdash;the
result and impulse of his generous, lofty, honourable
feelings. “So long as those papers remain in
existence, you, my dear brother, can at any moment
say to me, ‘<em>I repent of the step which I took in renouncing
my just rights and privileges; and I now
claim them</em>:’&mdash;and should you at any time thus address
me, it would only be for me to produce the papers
that establish your claims.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Arthur, you are generous&mdash;even to a fault!”
exclaimed Mr. Hatfield. “You know&mdash;or, at least, I
again assure you for the hundredth time, that not for
worlds would I heap disgrace on a noble name by
daring to assume it! Merciful heavens! shall the
coronet which becomes you so well, be snatched from
your brows, and transferred to those of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! Thomas&mdash;hush! this excitement is most
unnecessary,” interrupted the Earl. “You must not
blame me for the motives which induced me to keep
the documents;&mdash;and now&mdash;if you will have them
restored to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: give them to me, Arthur,” cried Mr.
Hatfield, resolving to destroy the papers without
farther delay.</p>

<p>“You claim them&mdash;they are yours&mdash;and they shall
at once be returned into your hands,” said the nobleman.
“But I conjure you to act not hastily nor
rashly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fear nothing, Arthur,” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield:
“but give me the papers! There is no time to lose&mdash;the
ladies will be waiting for us at the breakfast-table&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“True!” ejaculated the Earl: and, approaching
that shelf at the back of which the secret recess was
formed, he said, “Once every year have I inspected
this well concealed depository: once every year have
I assured myself that the precious documents were
safe;&mdash;and on those occasions, I have cleansed them
of the dust which even accumulates in a place that is
almost hermetically sealed.”</p>

<p>As the Earl thus spoke, he took down from the
shelf the books which stood immediately before the
recess; and Mr. Hatfield, receiving the volumes in
his hands, placed them upon the table. While performing
this simple and almost mechanical act, his
eyes were suddenly attracted to the name and date of
one of the books;&mdash;and his looks were rivetted, as it
were, on the words&mdash;“<cite>Annual Register, 1827</cite>.”</p>

<p>For the nature of the volume and the date of the
year whose incidents it recorded, suddenly revived the
poignancy of many bitter recollections, the sharpness
of which had been somewhat blunted by time: and
it was in a moment of strange nervousness&mdash;or
idiosyncratic excitement, that he opened the book
which thus had aroused those painful memories.</p>

<p>An ejaculation of horror&mdash;irrepressible horror&mdash;escaped
his lips: for he had lighted on the very page
which contained the account of his <em>Execution</em> at Horsemonger
Lane:&mdash;and at the very same instant a cry of
mingled amazement and alarm burst from the Earl of
Ellingham.</p>

<p>“Oh! is this a mere accident?” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield:
“or a warning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven&mdash;the papers!” ejaculated the nobleman.</p>

<p>“A warning that my son has seen this?” added
the unhappy father, almost distracted with the idea.</p>

<p>“Some miscreant has done this!” cried the Earl,
stamping his foot with rage: and it was seldom that
<em>he</em> thus gave way to his passion.</p>

<p>The brothers turned towards each other&mdash;exchanging
hasty glances of mutual and anxious enquiry.</p>

<p>“The papers are gone!” said the Earl, clasping his
hands in despair.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>“Gone!” repeated Mr. Hatfield, staggering as if
struck by a sudden blow. “And this book&mdash;this book,”
he faltered, in a faint tone, “was in the immediate
vicinity of the recess! He who took the papers&mdash;might
have read also&mdash;in that volume&mdash;the terrible account&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield could say no more: overpowered by
his feelings, he sank exhausted on the nearest seat.</p>

<p>The Earl glanced at the open page which his half-brother
had indicated; and, observing the nature of
the statement there recorded, he instantly comprehended
the cause of Mr. Hatfield’s emotions, and also
of the suspicions which had suddenly seized upon
him.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: this book has been read lately,” said
Arthur, in an excited and hurried manner: “behold!
the corners of the covers have been recently injured.
Oh! my God! what does all this mean?”</p>

<p>It will be recollected that on the memorable night
when Charles Hatfield pursued his successful researches
in the library, he had hurled away from him, in his
rage and almost maddening grief, the volume that
made such strange&mdash;such appalling revelations: and
the violence of the action had so far injured the book,
as to bend and graze the corners of the binding,&mdash;the
marks of the injury remaining clearly visible, and the
white interior of the leather being laid bare, and thus
proving how recently the work had been used.</p>

<p>“The book has been read very lately,” murmured
Mr. Hatfield, in a musing tone; “and the papers have
perhaps been stolen lately&mdash;-”</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed the Earl: “for not a month has
elapsed since I inspected that recess and found them
safe.”</p>

<p>“Then who could have done this?” cried Mr. Hatfield,
starting from his seat, in a sudden access of excitement
which was accompanied by a return of
moral and physical energy. “Oh! is it possible that
Charles is the author of all that seems so mysterious?
Has he searched for the records of my earlier life?&mdash;has
he by accident discovered and purloined those
papers&mdash;those fatal papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it must be he!” exclaimed the Earl: “for
did you not tell me that he spoke of claims&mdash;and
rights&mdash;and privileges unjustly withheld,&mdash;and that
be has harped upon what he termed the unnatural
conduct of his parents in concealing from him the
secret of his birth? Thomas&mdash;my dear Thomas,”
continued Lord Ellingham, speaking in a lower&mdash;more
measured&mdash;and more impressive tone, “I can see
it all! That young man has found out who you are:
be has learnt that you are the rightful heir to the
honours and estates which I enjoy;&mdash;and, believing
himself to be your legitimate son&mdash;according to the
assurance that you were forced, for your wife’s sake,
to give him&mdash;the deluded, deceived Charles Hatfield
fancies himself to be the lawful heir to the Earldom!”</p>

<p>“You have divined the truth, Arthur!” cried Mr.
Hatfield, his heart wrung to its very core by all the
maddening fears and torturing reflections which were
thus suddenly excited within him. “Oh! what
dreadful embarrassments&mdash;what frightful complications,
will this misapprehension entail on my unhappy
son&mdash;on you&mdash;on me&mdash;on all who are connected with
us!”</p>

<p>“There is not a moment to lose!” exclaimed Lord
Ellingham. “We must hasten after this infatuated
young man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened; and Clarence Villiers
entered the library,&mdash;the Earl having requested
him on the previous day to visit him at the hour
when, true to the appointment, he thus made his appearance.</p>

<p>Villiers, perceiving at the first glance, that something
unusual was agitating Lord Ellingham and Mr.
Hatfield, was about to retire, when the Earl, beckoning
him to advance, turned hastily round to his half-brother,
and said in a hurried whisper, “We will entrust
this matter to Villiers: he will conduct it with
less excitement than you and I; and, as he knows
your secret&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes:&mdash;but all he <em>does</em> know is that the Mr. Hatfield
of to-day is identical with the Thomas Rainford
of former times,” interrupted the Earl’s half-brother,
also speaking in a low and hasty tone: “remember&mdash;he
is unacquainted with aught of our family
secrets&mdash;ignorant of the parentage of Charles&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Neither is it necessary that he should be made
acquainted with all these facts,” interrupted Arthur:&mdash;“but
leave the matter to me.” Then, turning towards
Clarence, he said, “My dear Mr. Villiers, you
come most opportunely to render us an important service.
We have every reason to believe that Charles
has formed an improper connexion with a young
female of great beauty, residing with her mother in
very handsome lodgings in Suffolk Street: we likewise
conclude that he is there at this present moment.
Hasten thither, my good friend&mdash;demand an immediate
interview with Charles&mdash;and tell him that certain
discoveries have been made at home, in which
he is deeply interested. In a word, compel him to
accompany you away from the designing women who
have doubtless entangled him in their meshes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nay: let us not judge hastily,” cried Mr. Hatfield:
“remember&mdash;I have heard nothing against the
characters of these ladies; and it may be a virtuous
and honest affection, after all, that renders Charles
a visitor at their house. Let Mr. Villiers, then, act
with circumspection&mdash;and behave with the strictest
courtesy towards these ladies, should he encounter
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but under any circumstances you must persuade
Charles to return with you immediately to this
house,” said the Earl. “Mr. Hatfield will acquaint
you with the precise address of the lodgings in Suffolk
Street&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Earl’s half-brother mentioned the number of
the dwelling to which he had traced his son on the preceding
evening;&mdash;adding, “The name of the ladies is
Fitzhardinge&mdash;and I heard that the daughter bears
the singular denomination of <em>Perdita</em>.”</p>

<p>“Perdita!” cried Villiers, starting violently. “Oh!
if this be the case&mdash;&mdash;unhappy, lost Charles Hatfield!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! what mean you?” demanded the
wretched father, rendered terribly anxious by those
ominous words that fell on his ears like a death-knell.</p>

<p>“Two ladies&mdash;mother and daughter&mdash;dwelling together&mdash;and
the girl named <em>Perdita</em>,” mused Clarence
Villiers, not immediately heeding the earnest appeal
of Mr. Hatfield: “yes&mdash;yes&mdash;it must be they!&mdash;my
aunt&mdash;my wretched, wretched aunt who has returned
from transportation&mdash;and her profligate but beauteous
daughter!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Mrs. Slingsby who&mdash;years ago&mdash;you
know to what I allude?” asked Mr. Hatfield, in
a hurried tone, as he grasped Clarence violently by
the wrist.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I <em>do</em> mean that bad woman!” exclaimed
Villiers, who had now become painfully excited in his
turn: “and I regret&mdash;Oh! I regret to say that she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
has brought over to England her daughter, whom report
mentions as an angel of beauty and a demon in
profligacy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My God! Mr. Villiers&mdash;save Charles&mdash;save my
Charles from these incarnate fiends!” cried Mr. Hatfield.
“Or I myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And he was rushing to the door of the library, when
the Earl held him back, saying, “No, Thomas&mdash;you
must not go in this excited state: let Villiers take
the affair in hand.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield fell back into a seat, a prey to the most
painful&mdash;the most agonising emotions; while Clarence
hurriedly departed to execute the commission entrusted
to him.</p>

<p>The Earl now addressed himself to the task of consoling
his unfortunate brother-in-law;&mdash;and he had
just succeeded in inducing Mr. Hatfield to assume as
composed a demeanour as possible, preparatory to
their joint appearance at the breakfast-table, when
Clarence Villiers rushed into the room.</p>

<p>Not a quarter of an hour had elapsed since his departure;&mdash;and
this speedy return, together with his
agitated manner, raised new alarms in the breasts of
the Earl and Mr. Hatfield.</p>

<p>“They are gone&mdash;fled&mdash;all three together!” cried
Villiers, throwing himself exhausted on an ottoman,
and panting for breath.</p>

<p>“Gone!” repeated the miserable father, surveying
Clarence with eyes that stared wildly and unnaturally.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;gone!” said Villiers. “Ten minutes before
I reached Suffolk Street, my aunt, her daughter, and
Mr. Charles departed in a post-chaise, which had been
sent for apparently in consequence of some sudden
plan: for the people of the house were previously
unacquainted with the intention of their lodgers thus
to leave so abruptly.”</p>

<p>“But where was the chaise hired? and which road
has it taken?” demanded Mr. Hatfield, now manifesting
an energy and determination that proved his
readiness to meet the emergency and adopt measures
to pursue the fugitives.</p>

<p>“I sought for that information in vain,” returned
Clarence Villiers. “It appears that my aunt herself
went out to order the post-chaise; and that care was
taken not to allow the people of the house any opportunity
to converse with the post-boys. The rent and
other liabilities were all duly paid; and the landlady
of the lodgings accordingly makes no complaint of
the women who have quitted her abode.”</p>

<p>“What course do you intend to adopt?” hastily
demanded the Earl, turning to his half-brother.</p>

<p>“Order me your best horse to be saddled forthwith,”
said Mr. Hatfield; “and I will proceed in
pursuit of the runaways. ’Tis ten to one that I will
obtain some trace of them. Perhaps Mr. Villiers will
likewise mount horse, and take the northern road.”</p>

<p>“While I shall do the same, and pursue a westerly
direction,” observed the Earl.</p>

<p>“Good: for it was my intention to choose the route
towards Dover,” added Mr. Hatfield. “And now one
word more, Arthur,” he continued, the moment Villiers
had left the room to give the necessary orders
respecting the horses: “as it is probable that we may
recover and reclaim my self-willed son&mdash;and as, in
that case, penitence on his part might induce you to
forgive this absurd freak, so that the result may yet
be favourable to our nearest and dearest wishes,&mdash;under
all these circumstances, I say, suffer not Frances
to learn aught disparaging to his character.”</p>

<p>“I understand you, Thomas,” exclaimed the Earl,
wringing his half-brother’s hand in token of cordial
assent to this proposition. “I will even speak as
warily and cautiously as I may to my wife;&mdash;while,
on your side&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! I must tell every thing to Georgiana,” said
Mr. Hatfield: “suspense and uncertainty would be
intolerable to her. I shall now seek her for the purpose
of making a hasty but most sad communication:
and then away in pursuit of the ingrate!”</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour afterwards, the Earl of Ellingham,
Mr. Hatfield, and Clarence Villiers&mdash;all three
equipped for their journeys&mdash;repaired to the nobleman’s
stables in the immediate vicinity of the mansion;&mdash;and
thence they speedily issued forth, well
mounted, and each taking a separate direction.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXLI">CHAPTER CXLI.<br />

<span class="medium">THE FLIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>Upon breaking away from the presence of his father,
in the manner already described, Charles Hatfield
hurried to the house in Suffolk Street; and bursting
into the room where Mrs. Fitzhardinge and Perdita
were seated at breakfast, he exclaimed, “I have at
length thrown off all allegiance to my parents;&mdash;and
I must now act wholly and solely for my own
interests.”</p>

<p>“Not altogether for <em>your own</em>, Charles&mdash;dear
Charles,” said Perdita, fixing upon him a plaintive
and half-reproachful look, which made her appear
ravishingly beautiful in his eyes.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not altogether for myself will I act,” he
cried, embracing her tenderly: “but for thee also, my
angel&mdash;yes, for thee whom I love&mdash;adore&mdash;worship!”</p>

<p>“What has occurred this morning to render your
lordship thus agitated?” enquired Mrs. Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>“Oh! a quarrel with my father,” exclaimed
Charles, who, in the enthusiasm of his blind devotion
to Perdita, had forgotten the old woman’s presence.
“He has played the part of a spy upon me&mdash;he has
followed me to your door&mdash;he knows that I visit you&mdash;and
he will doubtless endeavour to cause a breach
between us!”</p>

<p>“Let us depart hence&mdash;now&mdash;at a moment’s warning!”
cried Perdita. “We have ample funds for the
purpose. Last night a money-lender discounted your
note, Charles: and I have the proceeds safe in my
own keeping.”</p>

<p>“Fortune favours us, then!” said the infatuated
young man. “Yes&mdash;we will depart without delay:
we will hasten to some retired place where we can deliberate,
fearless of interruption, on the course which it
will now be necessary for me to pursue.”</p>

<p>“I will hasten to order a past-chaise,” observed Mrs.
Fitzhardinge. “This task had better be performed by
myself&mdash;so that we may leave behind us no trace of
the route we shall have taken.”</p>

<p>“Thanks&mdash;a thousand thanks, my dear madam!”
cried Charles: then, when the old woman had left the
room, he caught Perdita in his arms and pressing her
fondly to his bosom, said, “My parents are resolved to
force me into a marriage with Lady Frances Ellingham&mdash;they
would separate me from you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! Charles&mdash;were such a destiny in store for
me,” said Perdita, affecting to be melted to tears, “I
should not be able to bear up against the misfortune.
For on you are all my hopes now fixed,&mdash;to you have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
I given my heart&mdash;irrevocably given it;&mdash;and were
you the veriest mendicant on the face of the earth, I
would never cease to love you as now I love!”</p>

<div id="i_121" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Adored Perdita!” cried the young man, enraptured
by the tender words and the enchanting manner
of the syren, as he strained her to his breast and imprinted
a thousand kisses on her brow, her cheeks, and
her lips. “Oh! never&mdash;never could I prove faithless
to thee, my beloved Perdita! Would that you were
mine indissolubly&mdash;that you were mine by the rites of
the Church and the sanction of the law;&mdash;for then we
might defy the world to separate us!”</p>

<p>“Would you have me renounce the peculiar opinions
which I have formed?” asked Perdita, her heart palpitating
with joy&mdash;for the young man had thus, of his
own accord, broached the delicate subject on which
she longed to speak, yet knew not how to begin.
“Because, if such be your wish, my beloved Charles,
I will make even the sacrifice of my strongest prejudices
to your heart’s desire&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, indeed, do I know that you love me, sweetest&mdash;dearest
girl!” interrupted Charles, experiencing
ineffable happiness at the idea of possessing the beauteous
Perdita on terms which would not render him
ashamed of his connexion. “Yes&mdash;yes: I <em>do</em> demand
that sacrifice at your hands;&mdash;and, if you yield
to my wishes in this respect, I shall receive your assent
as the most eloquent&mdash;the most convincing proof
of the attachment you avow! And, moreover, Perdita&mdash;dearest,
dearest Perdita&mdash;I shall be so rejoiced
to place a coronet on that fair brow of thine,&mdash;so
proud to present thee to the world as my wife! Never&mdash;never
will enraptured husband have experienced a
triumph so complete as that which will be mine, when
I shall conduct thee&mdash;so radiant, so dazzling in thy
beauty&mdash;amongst the friends whom the declaration of
my rank will gather around me,&mdash;and when I shall
introduce thee, adored one, as the Viscountess Marston!
Yes&mdash;I shall indeed be proud of thee, my
angel;&mdash;and now&mdash;will you not breathe the word that
is to promise me all this triumph and all this joy?&mdash;will
you not say, ‘<em>Charles, for thy sake, I will accompany
thee to the altar, and wed thee according to
the rites of the Protestant Church and the exigences
of the community</em>!’”</p>

<p>“Oh! not for another instant can I hesitate, my
well beloved&mdash;my handsome&mdash;my generous Charles!”
exclaimed the syren, casting her arms round his neck,
and pressing him as if in rapture to her glowing
bosom: then, in the sweetest, most dulcet intonations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
of her melodious voice, she said, “Yes&mdash;Charles, for
thy sake, I will accompany thee to the altar, and will
wed thee according to the rites of the Protestant
Church and the usages of that society in which we
live!”</p>

<p>“Now am I supremely happy!” cried Charles Hatfield,
his tone and manner fully corroborating his
words. “We will repair to Paris, my beloved Perdita&mdash;for
there we can be united by the chaplain of the
British Embassy without an instant’s unnecessary delay;
and thence also can I write to my father, solemnly
and formally calling upon him to assert his right to
the peerage which he has so long permitted his
younger brother to usurp. And in Paris my Perdita
will be the cynosure of all interest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;let us visit that delightful city of which
I have heard so much!” interrupted the young
woman, her eyes gleaming resplendently with the
pleasing sensations excited by the idea. “But I must
now leave you for a moment, to prepare for this sudden
journey&mdash;as my mother cannot be long before she
returns.”</p>

<p>Perdita rose from the sofa, and hastened from the
room, kissing her hand with playful fondness to her
lover as she crossed the threshold. Even that simple
action on her part excited the most ravishing feelings
in his soul;&mdash;for as she thus turned round for an instant
ere the door closed behind her, his looks swept
all the fulness&mdash;all the contours&mdash;all the rich proportions
of her voluptuous form,&mdash;while the morning
sun-light, rosy from the hues of the hangings through
which it penetrated, shone on her beauteous countenance,
giving splendour to the fine large eyes, freshness
to the vermilion lips, and a halo to her glossy hair!</p>

<p>She disappeared; and Charles, who had risen from
his seat simultaneously with herself, advanced to the
window. The street was quiet;&mdash;but the sounds of
the rapid vehicles in Cockspur Street met his ears;&mdash;and
he wondered whether the post-chaise were yet
approaching the dwelling.</p>

<p>This idea led him to ponder on the step which he
was about to take;&mdash;and a sensation of sadness slowly
crept upon him, as he reflected that he was on the
point of leaving his home&mdash;abandoning his parents
and friends! The recollection of his mother smote
him&mdash;smote him painfully;&mdash;and yet he did not seek
by inward, silent reasoning to improve this better
state of feeling, and act upon its warnings. No:&mdash;with
that perverseness which so frequently characterises
those who are on the point of adopting a
measure which they secretly know to be injudicious
and unwisely precipitate&mdash;even if no worse,&mdash;he sought
in sophistry and specious mental argument an apology
for his conduct. Again he reminded himself that his
parents had acted unnaturally towards him,&mdash;and
that their uniform conduct in this respect had now
been followed up by harshness, upbraidings, menaces,
and <em>espionnage</em>, on the part of his father. Then he
feasted his imagination with the thoughts of possessing
Perdita:&mdash;in a few days she would be his&mdash;irrevocably
his, and in a manner which would enable him
to present her proudly to the world as his wedded
wife. From this strain of meditations he glided into
glorious, gorgeous, visions of future greatness:&mdash;the
words, “My Lord,” and “Your Lordship,” only so recently
addressed to him, sounded like delicious music
in his ears;&mdash;and his painful reflections were subdued
by the feelings of triumph now once more awakened
within him. Love&mdash;ambition&mdash;hope,&mdash;all&mdash;all his
yearnings, all his cravings were now on the point of
being gratified: he should cast off that parental yoke
which had latterly weighed so heavily upon him;&mdash;he
was about to visit Paris&mdash;he would appear as a Viscount,
and with a beauteous bride, in the sphere of
fashion the most refined, elegance the most perfect,
and civilisation the most consummate,&mdash;and he already
fancied himself walking in the delicious gardens of the
Tuileries, with Perdita&mdash;the observed of all observers&mdash;leaning
fondly on his arm!</p>

<p>These visions&mdash;sweeping like a gorgeous pageantry
through his excited imagination&mdash;brought him to that
state of mind, in which all regrets were banished&mdash;all
remorse was forgotten;&mdash;and when Perdita returned to
the apartment, ready attired for the journey, he flew
towards her&mdash;he wound his arms around her wasp-like
waist, and pressed her enthusiastically to his
bosom.</p>

<p>This was the first time that he had seen her in a walking-dress;&mdash;and
he thought that she even appeared
more ravishingly beautiful than when in her morning
<em>d&eacute;shabill&eacute;e</em>, or her drawing-room garb. The pink crape
bonnet, adorned with artificial flowers, set off her fine
countenance with such admirable effect:&mdash;the flowing
drapery of the elegant summer-shawl meandered over
the proportions of the symmetrical form&mdash;developing
each contour with its wavy undulations:&mdash;and the
straw-coloured kid gloves, fitting tightly to a fault,
described the shape of the beautiful tapering fingers.</p>

<p>“You are lovely beyond the loveliness of woman!”
murmured Charles Hatfield, surveying her with an
admiration the most unfeigned&mdash;the most sincere.</p>

<p>“And you, Charles&mdash;are not you my own handsome,
dearly beloved Charles&mdash;so soon to be my husband?”
asked Perdita. “You said just now that you
should be proud to present me as your wife to your
friends:&mdash;Oh! I feel&mdash;yes, I feel that I shall also be
proud to be so presented. My mind seems to have
undergone a complete change since I made you that
promise to wed you at the altar;&mdash;and you must forget,
dear Charles, that I ever wished it otherwise!”</p>

<p>Hatfield, for all answer, impressed a burning kiss
upon her rosy lips;&mdash;and the young woman’s eyes became
soft and melting in expression&mdash;voluptuous and
languid with desire.</p>

<p>At this instant her mother returned, with the announcement
that the post-chaise would be at the door
in less than a quarter of an hour; and the old woman
hastened to the bed-rooms to pack up the trunks. Her
daughter, who kept the purse, then gave her the necessary
money to liquidate all liabilities due to the landlady
of the house; and while this was being done, Perdita
placed the gold and Bank-notes in Charles’s hand,
saying, “In the excitement of the morning’s incidents
I forgot to tender you this amount before.”</p>

<p>“Henceforth all that I have is yours equally, my
beloved,” said the young man, as he secured the money
about his person.</p>

<p>The post-chaise-and-four now appeared; and while
the trunks were being strapped on to the vehicle,
Mrs. Fitzhardinge superintended the process, apparently
with the bustling officiousness of an old woman
of particular habits, but in reality to prevent any communication
between the post-boys and the people of
the dwelling;&mdash;for she knew how inquisitive lodging-house
keepers were apt to be, and that postilions were
proportionately communicative.</p>

<p>At length all the arrangements were completed;&mdash;Charles
handed his Perdita into the vehicle&mdash;manifested
the same politeness towards the old mother&mdash;and
then entered it himself. Mrs. Fitzhardinge had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
placed herself with her back to the horses, on an imperious
sign from Perdita to that effect;&mdash;so that the
young couple were next to each other on the same
seat.</p>

<p>The post-chaise rolled rapidly away from Suffolk
Street, and passed down Whitehall towards Westminster
Bridge. So long as the wheels rattled over
the stones, but little conversation took place inside
the vehicle,&mdash;though Charles and Perdita conveyed to
each other many tender assurances by means of the
eloquent language of the eyes and the pressure of
hands. When, however, the chaise emerged from the
more crowded, thoroughfares of the metropolis, and
entered upon the Dover Road, the travelling party
were enabled to discourse at ease.</p>

<p>The day was very sultry;&mdash;but the upper part of
the barouche was now thrown open; and the speed
at which they travelled, created a current of air that
mitigated the intensity of the heat. However, Perdita
put up her parasol; and as the faces of the happy
pair were not very far apart, the silk canopy, circumscribed
though it were, shaded those fine countenances
which really seemed made to be side by side with each
other,&mdash;both being so handsome!</p>

<p>For a short time the conversation was general
amongst the three:&mdash;gradually, however, Mrs. Fitzhardinge
was, as it were, excluded from its range&mdash;not
rudely so,&mdash;but because it became of a tender
description between the young gentleman and her
daughter;&mdash;and then it languished somewhat, inasmuch
as the old woman was a restraint upon them.</p>

<p>At length there was a pause altogether; but still
Charles and Perdita felt no weariness in each other’s
society. They gazed on each other&mdash;drinking draughts
of love in each other’s looks,&mdash;and often pressing each
other’s hands</p>

<p>For Perdita really loved the young man,&mdash;loved
him with a deep and ardent affection, of which however
sensuality formed no inconsiderable portion.
Nevertheless, she <em>did</em> love him after the fashion of
her own heart;&mdash;and thus to some extent the snarer
had become ensnared!</p>

<p>It was in a humour of melting and voluptuous
languor, that, suddenly breaking the silence noticed
above, Perdita said in her soft, dulcet tones, “Charles,
how delicious is it to travel in this manner! Do you
know that I feel as if I should like you to repeat to
me a piece of poetry&mdash;or tell me some interesting tale&mdash;for
it is so sweet to hear the sound of your voice.
But if you thus gratify my caprice&mdash;this whim of the
moment&mdash;let the theme of your recitation be love!”</p>

<p>“I will endeavour to please you, my charmer,” returned
the young man;&mdash;“and at this moment I
bethink me of a Love Story that I wrote myself some
few years ago&mdash;one day, when the mania for scribbling
suddenly seized upon me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that will be truly delightful!” exclaimed
Perdita. “A story of your own composition! Begin,
Charles&mdash;dear Charles: I am dying to hear this specimen
of your abilities.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it will prove but a poor one,” returned
Hatfield. “At the same time, such as it is, I will repeat
it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhardinge, having overheard this dialogue,
intimated the pleasure she should experience in listening
to the tale;&mdash;and as the chaise was now rolling
along a road rendered, as it were, soft by the accumulation
of the dust of summer, Charles was not compelled
to pitch his voice to a key unpleasantly high,
in relating the ensuing narrative.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXLII">CHAPTER CXLII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE DRESS-MAKER: A LOVE STORY.</span></h2>

<p>“It was between nine and ten o’clock on a dark and
rainy night, in the month of November, 1834, that a
young female, plainly but decently attired, was wending
her way along Oxford Street. She had a large
parcel beneath her cloak;&mdash;and this parcel she protected
against the rain with the most jealous care,&mdash;thinking
more, in fact, of the object of her solicitude
than of picking her path with sufficient nicety to
enable her to avoid the puddles of water that were
ankle-deep in some parts of the pavement&mdash;but more
especially at the crossings. For, in sooth, it was a
bitter&mdash;bitter night:&mdash;the windows of heaven appeared
to be indeed opened, and the rain fell in torrents.
The streets seemed to be positively covered in
with an arcade of umbrellas, on which the quick drops
rattled down with the violence of hail. The young
female whom I have mentioned, had an umbrella;&mdash;but
she found it rather a difficult task to hold it comfortably
with one hand, while her left arm encircled
as it were the precious parcel beneath her cloak. For
the passengers in the streets of London are never over
remarkable for their civility to each other&mdash;still less
so on such a night as the one I am describing. The
consequence was that there was an incessant struggle
amongst the strong to push their umbrellas safely
through the mass, and amongst the weak to prevent
their own umbrellas from being dragged out of their
hands;&mdash;but it naturally happened that the latter
fared the worst.</p>

<p>“The young female was meek, timid, and unobtrusive.
She only sought to be permitted to pursue
her way in peace, without being molested;&mdash;for,
heaven knows! she had not the least desire on her
part to inconvenience a soul. But first some rude,
hulking fellow would thrust her against the houses&mdash;almost
through the shop windows; then, if she
moved over to the kerb-stone of the pavement, she
found herself speedily pushed into the mud. To
pursue a middle course was impossible; because the
two streams of persons carrying umbrellas were the
monopolists there;&mdash;and so the young female began to
lament the necessity which had sent her forth into the
streets on such a night as this. At length she reached
the iron gates leading into Hanover Square; and she
rejoiced&mdash;for she thought within herself that she had
now got clear of the crowd, and need entertain no
farther apprehension of having the precious parcel
knocked out of her hands. But just as she entered
the Square, a rude, coarse fellow rushed against her as
he was running hastily round the corner; and such
was the violence of the concussion, that the parcel
was knocked from beneath her arm. The ruffian who
had caused the accident, burst into a ferocious laugh,
as if he had just performed a most humorous or clever
feat, and darted away. But the young female was
disconsolate at what had occurred; and tears started
into her eyes. Though bruised and hurt by the man’s
violence, she thought not of herself&mdash;she felt no pain:&mdash;it
was on account of the parcel that she was so
deeply grieved. Hastily picking it up, she hurried to
the nearest lamp; and the moment she examined the
packet beneath the gas-light, she found her worst
apprehensions confirmed. For the parcel contained a
costly silk dress, well wrapped up in brown paper;&mdash;but
the side on which it had fallen was dripping wet
and covered with mud!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>“‘O heavens! no food <em>again</em> to-night!’ exclaimed
the young female aloud&mdash;for in her despair she paused
not to notice whether she were noticed or overheard.
And she <em>was</em> both noticed and overheard,&mdash;and by a
tall, handsome individual, of gentlemanly appearance,
and muffled in a capacious cloak. He had issued from
the nearest house at the moment the accident occurred;
and, perceiving the brutality of the encounter, though
too late to prevent it or to chastise the perpetrator, he
stood still to observe the young female, whose countenance,
as the rays of the lamp fell upon it, struck
him as being remarkably beautiful. In that rapid
survey, partial as it was by the flickering light, which
was moreover dimmed by the mist of the falling rain,
the stranger fancied that he perceived&mdash;independently
of the despair which that countenance now wore&mdash;a
certain settled melancholy expression, that at once
rivetted his interest and excited his sympathies. But
when those words&mdash;so terrible in their meaning,&mdash;‘O
heavens! no food <em>again</em> to-night!’ fell upon his
ears, he accosted the young female, and said, in a
tone of respectful though somewhat condescending
pity, ‘My poor girl, it appears that a sad accident
has befallen you.’&mdash;The young woman, or rather girl&mdash;for
she was not more than eighteen years of age&mdash;looked
up into the face of the individual who
thus addressed her; and, perceiving that it was no
insolent coxcomb who spoke, she replied in a tone of
deep melancholy, ‘Yes, sir: it is to <em>me</em> a great misfortune!’&mdash;The
stranger read, or fancied he read, an
entire history in those few and plaintively uttered
words,&mdash;how, perhaps, a young dress-maker had toiled
to finish a particular piece of work in the hope of receiving
instantaneous payment on taking it home,&mdash;how
the article had been thrown down, soiled, and
rendered at least unfit to be delivered that night to its
owner, even if it were not spoilt altogether,&mdash;and how
the poor girl had lost her only chance of obtaining the
wherewith to procure a meal. Upon more closely,
though still with great delicacy, questioning the young
female, the stranger found all his surmises to be correct;
but she could not tell whether the silk dress
were injured beyond redemption or not. ‘In any case,’
she added, still weeping bitterly, ‘I shall tell the lady
the truth when I take home the dress to-morrow.’&mdash;These
words, uttered with the most unquestionable sincerity,
made a deep impression upon the gentleman who
was addressing her; for they denoted an unsophisticated
uprightness of character which augmented the interest
he already felt in the poor young creature.&mdash;‘And who
is the lady you speak of?’ he enquired.&mdash;‘The Dowager
Marchioness of Wilmington,’ was the reply.&mdash;‘Ah!’
ejaculated the stranger: then, after a moment’s pause,
he said, ‘Pardon me, young woman, for having asked
you so many questions: but it has not been through
motives of idle curiosity. Here is a small sum that
will procure you immediate necessaries;’&mdash;and thrusting
a coin into her hand, he hurried away. The deed
took the poor girl completely by surprise;&mdash;for although
it has occupied me some time to relate all that passed
between her and the generous stranger, yet in reality
their dialogue was of scarcely more than two minutes’
duration; and the dress-maker had not yet recovered
from the grief into which the accident to her parcel
had plunged her. When, therefore, the light of the
lamp flashed upon a bright yellow coin, she could
scarcely believe her eyes:&mdash;she fancied that her benefactor
had made a mistake, and intended to give her a
shilling,&mdash;and then, in spite of the cold night, the warm
blood rushed to her cheeks, at the idea of any one
treating her as a mendicant&mdash;for she had her little
feelings of pride, poor though she were! But her next
thought was that the stranger might really have intended
to present her with a sovereign; and&mdash;so
strange a sentiment is human pride, even in the most
virtuous bosoms&mdash;her soul revolted not from receiving
that amount. And now, lest this circumstance should
induce you to form an evil opinion of my heroine, I
must inform you that it was no selfish nor avaricious
feeling that made her draw a distinction between the
gift of a shilling and that of a sovereign:&mdash;but she had
been tenderly and genteelly brought up&mdash;and the comparison
which her mind drew, was simply as between
the alms that one would toss to a mendicant, and the
pecuniary aid which a delicate benevolence would
administer to a person in temporary embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Of all these things she thought as she retraced
her way along Oxford Street,&mdash;holding her umbrella
with her right hand, and with her left arm encircling
the parcel more carefully than before. She came to
the conclusion that the sovereign was not given by
mistake; and she resolved to avail herself of the
bounty which Providence itself had appeared to bestow
upon her in the hour of her bitterest need. She
thought of the little brother who was anxiously expecting
her return, and who had fared so scantily for
the last few days,&mdash;that little brother of only eight
years old, whom the sudden, premature, and almost
simultaneous death of their parents, about two years
previously, had left so completely dependant upon
her! As she drew near the street in which she lived,
she stopped at the baker’s where she was accustomed
to deal, and purchased some nice buns;&mdash;and then she
hurried on until she reached the house wherein she
rented a small back room on the third floor. On entering
the little chamber, which, though poorly furnished,
was very clean and neat, a beautiful boy, with
light brown curly hair and fine blue eyes, but with
cheeks somewhat pale, sprang towards her, exclaiming
‘Oh! dear sister Julia, I am so glad you have
come back: for I cannot bear to be left alone so long!’&mdash;‘I
have brought you something nice, Harry,’ said the
kind girl, smiling sweetly upon him; and, she placed
the bag containing the buns in his hand. Joy
sparkled in his eyes;&mdash;but in another moment he observed
that his sister had brought back the parcel,
which she had opened, and was carefully examining
the silk-dress to ascertain the amount of injury done
to it. Throwing the cakes upon the table, the boy
hastened to question her; but poor Julia could not
answer him&mdash;scalding tears were trickling down her
cheeks&mdash;a suffocating grief filled her bosom,&mdash;for she
found, to her dismay, that the dress was completely
spoilt!</p>

<p>“She sate down, and gave full vent to her anguish;&mdash;and
then little Harry threw his arms round her
neck, and endeavoured to console her. The flood of
tears which she shed, and the affectionate conduct of
her little brother at length considerably soothed her;&mdash;and
the poor girl made up her mind to meet her
misfortune with resignation. ‘You are dripping wet,
dear Julia,’ said Harry: ‘and there is not a morsel
of coal left,’ he added, looking at the miserable remnant
of a fire which was fast extinguishing in the
grate.&mdash;‘Poor boy! you have been cold,’ exclaimed
the dress-maker, not thinking of herself.&mdash;‘No, dear
Julia,’ he answered; ‘for I have been walking up and
down the room, to keep myself awake till you came
back. I was only afraid that the candle would not
last.’&mdash;‘Nor will it many minutes longer, Harry!’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
cried Julia, starting from her seat. ‘But do not be
afraid, my dear little fellow; for I have plenty of
money to buy all we want for the moment. A good
kind gentleman took compassion upon me, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;’;
she did not choose to say, ‘<em>and gave me some
money</em>;’&mdash;for, somehow or another, her pure soul revolted
from the idea that she had been the object of
eleemosynary benevolence on the part of a stranger:&mdash;so,
cutting the matter short, she kissed her little brother
tenderly, bade him eat his cakes, and, promising
to return in a few minutes, hurried away. She ordered
up coals and wood from the nearest shed,&mdash;thence
she repaired to the grocer’s, where she purchased
a few articles,&mdash;and lastly, she sped to the
baker’s, to buy bread. But the moment she entered
this shop, the master rushed from behind the counter,
seized her rudely, called her by many opprobrious
names, and, raising an alarm, attracted the attention
of a policeman who was passing by. The constable
entered the shop, and enquired the cause of the disturbance;
but poor Julia had fainted;&mdash;and she,
therefore, heard not the charge that was made against
her. When she came to her senses, she gazed wildly
around, thinking that she had just awoke from a
horrid dream;&mdash;but, alas! it was all too true! She
was seated in a chair in the middle of the
shop&mdash;a policeman standing near her&mdash;and a gaping,
curious crowd collected at the door. ‘Now,
young woman,’ said the officer, ‘come along with
me!’&mdash;Julia cast upon him a look so full of horror
and amazement, that the man’s heart was for an
instant touched;&mdash;but, being accustomed to endless
varieties of imposture on the part of offenders, he
speedily recovered the cold indifference so characteristic
of his class, and said sternly, if not brutally, ‘None
of this nonsense: you must tramp off to the station-house!’&mdash;‘But
what have I done? what offence have
I committed?’ asked Julia, in a tone of the most pathetic
entreaty. ‘Oh! there must be some dreadful
mistake in all this!’&mdash;‘No mistake at all,’ said the
officer; ‘and you’ll know all about it in the morning,
when you go before the magistrate!’&mdash;‘The magistrate!’
repeated the girl, with the emphasis of despair.
‘But my poor little brother, what will become of him?’&mdash;‘That’s
no business of mine,’ returned the constable:
’come along!’&mdash;and he dragged the half-fainting Julia
from the shop.</p>

<p>“Away to the nearest station-house was the unhappy
young woman rather borne than conducted;&mdash;and
so stunned&mdash;so stupefied was she by this sudden,
unaccountable, and overwhelming misfortune, that her
tongue refused to give utterance to the questions
which her suspense prompted her lips to frame. The
station was close by; and thus was it that before she
had leisure to recover from her bewilderment and
terror, she found herself thrust into a dark cell&mdash;all
dripping wet from head to foot as she was. When full
consciousness returned, and she was enabled to look
her misfortune in the face, she found that all the articles
she had purchased at the grocer’s and all the remainder
of her money were gone. Yet she could not
possibly conceive on what charge she had been thus
rudely treated;&mdash;and her conscience inspired her with
the hope that her complete innocence must become
apparent in the morning. But the thought of her
little brother excited the most painful sensations in
her bosom:&mdash;her heart was rent with pangs that
seemed to threaten her very existence! The poor
little fellow!&mdash;she fancied she saw him sitting in the
cold, lonely chamber, crying bitterly at his sister’s prolonged
absence:&mdash;and then a thousand fears haunted
her&mdash;all distracting in the extreme. Might he not
take it into his head to go out to look after her?&mdash;he,
who was so ignorant of London!&mdash;and then might he
not be lost in the mazes of the mighty metropolis, and
on a night when it would be almost death to him to
wander about the flooded streets? Oh! all these
fears&mdash;these thoughts were terrible;&mdash;for she dearly
loved her little brother&mdash;loved him, perhaps, the more
affectionately, the more tenderly, because their orphan
condition rendered him so completely dependant upon
her,&mdash;and because he was so much attached to her,
and his ways were so winning&mdash;his disposition so
cheerful!</p>

<p>“In the midst of these harrowing meditations a
policeman opened the trap in the door of the cell, and
called her by name&mdash;‘<em>Julia Murray!</em>’ She answered
in a faint and feeble tone; and the officer was about
to close the trap, satisfied that his prisoner was not ill
nor had attempted suicide,&mdash;when the young woman
suddenly exclaimed, ‘Stop one moment!’&mdash;‘Well,
what is it?’ demanded the constable.&mdash;In a few hurried
words Julia explained to him how she had a
little brother expecting her return, how he would be
overwhelmed with grief at her unaccountable absence,
and how grateful she should feel if any one could be
sent to inform the child that his sister would be certain
to return in the morning. The constable, who
was a kind-hearted man, promised that her request
should be complied with; and he was about to depart
when, a thought striking him, he said, ‘But are you
so sure, young woman, of getting off so easy as you
imagine. The charge is a serious one, mind!’&mdash;‘The
charge!’ she repeated: ‘I do not even yet know what
it is!’&mdash;‘Oh! that’s all gammon,’ cried the constable,
closing the trap abruptly; and now, his opinion of the
prisoner being that she was a hardened impostor,
and had some sinister motive in view in sending a
message to her lodgings, determined to trouble himself
no more concerning the matter. It was, however,
some consolation to the poor girl to believe
that her commission would be duly executed;&mdash;for,
though she had heard the officer’s unfeeling, cutting
observation relative to her ignorance of the accusation
against her, she could not for an instant suppose that
he would neglect to fulfil his promise regarding her
little brother. But wearily&mdash;wearily passed away that
night&mdash;not once did the poor dress-maker close her
eyes&mdash;and she counted every hour that was proclaimed
from the neighbouring church-clock&mdash;often saying
to herself that never, never had time travelled with
such leaden pace before! She had not tasted food for
many hours&mdash;and yet she was not hungry; but she
experienced a terrible faintness at the chest, and an
oppressiveness on the brain, that at intervals made
her mind wander. Her cloak was dripping wet when
she had been locked up, and her shoes, stockings, and
the lower part of her dress were saturated;&mdash;but she
had thrown her cloak aside, and her garments had
dried upon her;&mdash;and now she felt not positively cold&mdash;only
a numbness in her limbs, which gave her however
no pain.</p>

<p>“At length the dull, misty, wintry morning
dawned upon the metropolis&mdash;though all was still
dark in her gloomy cell. Presently an officer entered,
and gave her a cup of hot coffee and a piece of
bread. She asked him if the message had been sent
to her brother;&mdash;but he was not the same constable
who had made the round of the cells at midnight, and
therefore knew nothing about the matter. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
he was a stern, sulky man; and she dared
not speak farther to him&mdash;much as she longed to
ascertain the real nature of the charge against her.
She drank the coffee, which seemed to do her good;&mdash;but
she could not force a single mouthful of the
bread down her throat&mdash;though the cravings of hunger
now began to oppress her cruelly. But, to use a common
phrase, her heart heaved against food. A couple
of hours more passed away, and then the same policeman
who had arrested her on the preceding evening
came to conduct her to the police-office. While
they were proceeding thither, Julia enquired the
nature of the charge against her; and she now learnt
for the first time that the coin which she had changed
at the bakers, and which she had believed to be a
sovereign, was only a gilt counter, of the kind used at
card tables in genteel society. She was cruelly
shocked at this information, and frankly and candidly
explained to the officer the manner in which she had
become possessed of it; but he only shook his head,
and seemed to put but little faith in her story. Julia
was, however, too much absorbed in the vexation and
ignominy she had thus been subjected to, and was still
enduring, to notice the man’s incredulity;&mdash;but she
clung to the hope that her tale would be believed by
the magistrate before whom she was about to appear.
It happened that the usual charges of drunkenness
were just disposed of, at the moment when the young
female entered the court; and she was accordingly at
once placed at the bar&mdash;the baker being already in
attendance to prefer his charge against her. This he
did in a plain and straight-forward manner,&mdash;showing
no ill-feeling against the prisoner&mdash;but, on the contrary,
alleging that he had always believed her to be
a highly respectable, industrious, and praise-worthy
young woman until the present transaction took place.
He added that he had given her into custody in a
moment of irritation, believing himself to have been
duped; and that he should be truly delighted if she
could make her innocence apparent. Julia’s courage
was somewhat restored by the forbearing conduct of
the baker&mdash;for her own good sense told her that the
case was really one involving much unpleasant suspicion;&mdash;and
she now told her tale with an artlessness
and sincerity that produced no inconsiderable effect
upon the bench. Nevertheless, as the magistrate observed,
it certainly appeared strange that a gentleman
should have given her a gilt counter in mistake for a
sovereign,&mdash;strange also that a mere stranger should
have intended to bestow upon her a sovereign at all.
The magistrate proceeded to state that the prisoner
must be remanded, in order that the gentleman of
whom she spoke&mdash;if her story were true&mdash;might come
forward, upon seeing the report of the case in the newspapers,
and tender his evidence. Julia burst out into an
agony of weeping, when she heard that she must go to
prison for a week; and the baker requested the magistrate
to re-consider his decision. This appeal was, however,
made in vain; but it was intimated that bail would
be received for the prisoner’s re-appearance. The baker
gave a whispered assurance to the unhappy girl that
he would get two of his friends to become security for
her; and this promise consoled her. When she was
removed from the office, on her way to a cell in the
rear of the establishment, the baker told her that his
wife had taken care of her brother, who had passed the
night at their house: and he expressed his deep regret
that he should have proceeded against her, as he had
learnt from her landlady that she was a young woman
of most exemplary character. To be brief, the baker
performed his promise of procuring bail for the prisoner;
and at about two o’clock in the afternoon she was enabled
to return home.</p>

<p>“Little Harry was speedily brought back to her by
the baker’s wife, who, it appeared, had bitterly reproached
her husband on the preceding evening for his
conduct towards Miss Murray, and, with considerate
kindness, had at once sent for her brother, whom the
good woman consoled with some plausible tale accounting
for his sister’s absence. Julia was not however
happy, even though restored to liberty; for the charge
still hung over her&mdash;and so much depended on the
chance of the appearance of her unknown benefactor,
who, she still firmly believed, had accidentally and
most unintentionally given her the gilt counter
which had led to so much wretchedness and serious
embarrassment. Her first care was now, however,
to proceed to the house of the old Marchioness
of Wilmington, with the silk-dress, which was completely
spoiled; and Julia’s heart was heavy as she
hurried along Oxford Street. The weather was dull
and gloomy; but the rain had ceased, and the two
streams of people flowed on, in different directions,
without the hurry, bustle, and struggling that had
prevailed on the preceding evening. Julia’s bosom
palpitated nervously when she reached the spot where
the accident had occurred&mdash;that accident to which
her present sorrows might be traced. On reaching the
house of that marchioness in Hanover Square, the poor
girl was conducted into the presence of the dowager&mdash;a
proud, stately dame whose age exceeded fifty,
but who endeavoured by means of rouge, false hair,
false teeth, and the appliances of the toilette, to appear
at least twenty years younger. Her ladyship was
seated in a small, but elegantly furnished parlour, and
was occupied in reading&mdash;no, in skimming&mdash;the last
new novel, which, according to the usual fashion, had
been carefully spun out into three volumes, though
all the incidents it contained might with advantage
have been condensed into one. At a beautiful little
work-table, sate a lovely creature of two-and-twenty,
with hair as dark as jet, fine large black eyes, and a tall
symmetrical, but rather robust figure. On this fair
young lady’s countenance there was a slight shade of
melancholy; and her cheeks were somewhat pale&mdash;but
apparently through a secret care, and not ill-health.
This was Lady Caroline Jerningham, the
only daughter of the marchioness, and consequently
sister to the Marquis of Wilmington, her ladyship’s
only son.</p>

<p>“On entering the presence of these ladies, Julia,
who had previously arranged in her own imagination
the precise terms in which she proposed to tell her
tale,&mdash;with a strict adherence to truth,&mdash;forgot all her
studied task, and became overwhelmed with confusion.
The marchioness looked so stately&mdash;so prim&mdash;so queen-like
in her deportment, not to say positively austere,
that the poor girl was seized with vague apprehensions
and unknown terrors, as if she had committed a great
and grievous fault. Lady Caroline, however, cast
upon her a look of such kind encouragement, and also
of such significance, that it almost struck Julia at
the moment that the young patrician lady had a
fore-knowledge of the disaster which had occurred to
the dress. Yet how was that possible?&mdash;and as the
absurdity of such an idea forced itself upon the girl’s
mind the instant after the idea itself was entertained,
her confusion and embarrassment were increased, and
she burst into tears. The dowager uttered an ejaculation
of surprise; and Julia, hastily wiping her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
eyes, cast an appealing glance on Lady Caroline, who,
to her relief and amazement, she beheld gazing upon
her with an expression of reassurance and deep&mdash;almost
tender interest. Encouraged by the evident
graciousness of the young lady, Julia proceeded to
open the parcel; and, while so doing, she began an
explanation of the accident which had occurred to
the dress. The countenance of the marchioness, to
whom she glanced timidly, lowered and contracted;&mdash;but
Lady Caroline hastened to observe, in a kind and
condescending manner, ‘Whatever has happened to
the dress, Miss Murray, I am confident my mother
will attribute to a misfortune, and to no blameable
neglect on your part.’&mdash;‘Permit me to answer for myself,
Lady Caroline,’ said the dowager, in a tone of
haughty remonstrance to her daughter, and with an
austere look at the trembling Julia. ‘Young woman,’
she continued, now addressing herself direct to the
poor girl, ‘you were recommended to me by Lady
Lumley, as an efficient, honest, careful, and deserving
person,&mdash;one, who, having been brought up tenderly
and by parents moving in a genteel sphere until the
time of their decease, was suddenly compelled to have
recourse to the needle to earn a subsistence. Under
such circumstances, and with this recommendation, I
sent for you&mdash;I agreed to give you a trial&mdash;and, as I
perceive, you have spoilt for me a dress that will
cost me ten guineas to replace it.’&mdash;‘I admit, my lady,’
said Julia, ‘that you have great cause to be dissatisfied.
But heaven is my witness that it was an accident;
and if your ladyship will permit me, I will toil
day and night until I shall have obtained the wherewith
to make good the loss.’&mdash;‘No, young woman,’
observed the marchioness, somewhat mollified by the
artlessness and respectful demeanour of Julia Murray;
‘I cannot, being rich, oppress you, who are poor. All
that I can do in the case is to decline giving you any
farther employment. You may retire:’ and, having
thus spoken with a sententious pomposity that would
have become a statesman, the noble lady waved her
hand authoritatively.</p>

<p>“Julia’s eyes filled with tears, which nearly blinded
her&mdash;so that she observed not how peculiar was the
interest with which Lady Caroline Jerningham was
surveying her:&mdash;but, having vainly endeavoured to
stammer forth a few words imploring a continuance of
the patronage of the marchioness, she hurried from
the room. On the landing outside she paused for a
few moments to wipe away the traces of tears from
her countenance and somewhat compose herself; for
she shrank from the idea of attracting unpleasant
notice on the part of the lacqueys lounging in the hall
through which she must pass to reach the street-door.
Suddenly she felt a gentle touch upon the shoulder;
for she had seated herself in a chair on the landing,
being overcome with grief and physical exhaustion;&mdash;and
starting up, she beheld Lady Caroline standing by
her side. ‘Hush!’ said the fair patrician, placing her
finger upon her lip, and glancing towards the parlour-door,
as much as to imply that she had stolen away
from her mother’s presence and would not have her
motive suspected: ‘here, my poor girl, take this&mdash;and,
when you require a friend, fear not to apply to
me&mdash;but by letter, remember, in the first instance!’&mdash;Thus
speaking, Lady Caroline thrust five sovereigns
into Julia’s hand, and instantly returned to the parlour,
not waiting a moment to receive the thanks of
the astonished and delighted girl.</p>

<p>“Julia Murray now hurried home, and found little
Harry anxiously expecting her return;&mdash;for, although
he was too young to comprehend the nature of the
alarms which she had experienced, when sallying
forth, on account of the spoilt dress, yet he was fearful
lest she might remain away from him for several
hours again. He had no cares&mdash;that poor little fellow&mdash;when
his sister was with him; and he now asked
her, in so sweet yet earnest a manner, not to leave
him any more during a whole night, that she felt as if
she would go through fire and water for that darling
boy. But she had no work in hand; and though she
possessed five sovereigns,&mdash;real sovereigns, and no gilt
counters this time,&mdash;yet she could not bear the idea of
being idle. She however promised to remain at home
all that day; and she prepared a nice little dinner,
which made Harry so happy that she wished&mdash;Oh!
how sincerely she wished&mdash;she could always provide
for him in the same manner. She endeavoured to
appear as cheerful as she could;&mdash;but there was a
weight upon her spirits&mdash;for the accusation still hung
over her head, and she was in suspense whether the
unknown would see her case in the papers, and appear
to justify her. Besides, would not the publicity given
to the affair injure her with those kind patronesses
who had hitherto taken such an interest in the orphan
girl? and, should the stranger-gentleman not be forthcoming,
would not a stigma be affixed upon her character,
even though the magistrate (as the baker
assured her must be the alternative) should dismiss
the case? Of all these things she thought;&mdash;and
when Harry noticed her not, a pearly tear would
trickle down her pale but beauteous face. For Julia
<em>was</em> very beautiful. Her hair was of a rich dark
brown&mdash;her eyes of melting blue&mdash;her teeth of pearly
whiteness&mdash;and her shape elegant, graceful, and sylph-like.</p>

<p>“On the ensuing morning, after breakfast, Julia
had just put on her bonnet and shawl to go out for
the purpose of calling upon her various patronesses
and enquiring whether they needed her services,
when the landlady of the house in which she lodged,
entered the room and said, ‘Miss Murray, a gentleman
wishes to speak to you: he will not walk
up to your apartment, as he does not know whether
you may choose to receive him here; and he is accordingly
waiting in my parlour.’&mdash;A ray of hope
flashed to the mind of the young woman: what if
it were the unknown who had given her the gilt
counter? The suspicion was strengthened by the
delicacy of his behaviour in not ascending to her
chamber; for, during the brief discourse which she
had with him on the night so fatal to her, he had
manifested a disposition quite in accordance with
the propriety of conduct and considerate proceeding
adopted by the individual who now waited to see
her. Telling Harry that she should not be long,
Julia hurried down stairs; and in a few moments
she found herself in the presence of the individual
who was uppermost in her thoughts. Yes:&mdash;it
was indeed he&mdash;the unknown,&mdash;the same tall,
handsome man,&mdash;and enveloped, too, in a cloak
richly lined with sables. He was about eight-and-twenty
years of age; and there was something noble
and commanding, though gracious and encouraging,
in his air and demeanour. The moment Julia made
her appearance, he rose from the chair in which he
had been seated, and taking her hand, said in a tone
of the most earnest sincerity, ‘Miss Murray, I know
not in what terms to express the shame and grief
which I experience at the misfortune that has overtaken
you. It was not until I saw this mornings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
newspaper, that I even dreamt of the mistake&mdash;the
dreadful mistake I had made: and the instant the
case met my eyes, I hurried hither. The explanation
which I have to give, you can of course anticipate:&mdash;I
had purchased some gilt counters only half-an-hour
before I met you in Hanover Square, and
I put them loose into the same pocket which contained
my money.’&mdash;‘I never for an instant imagined,
sir,’ said Julia, ‘that you had purposely trifled with
my feelings.’&mdash;‘Generous young woman, to put such
a construction upon a matter which has caused you
so much suffering!’ exclaimed the unknown. ‘But
it is now my duty to accompany you at once to the
police-court, and place your character in the same
honourable light in which it originally stood.’&mdash;Julia
was overjoyed at this announcement; and the
gentleman, giving her his arm, escorted her to the
police-court, calling however on the baker in their
way to desire him to attend immediately before the
magistrate. During the walk, the stranger asked
the young woman a great many questions&mdash;not of
an impertinent nature, nor denoting an idle curiosity,&mdash;but
rather evincing an interest in the orphan girl.
It however struck Julia as somewhat singular that
he did not put a single query to her relative to the
spoilt dress: it seemed as if he had quite forgotten
that incident!</p>

<p>“On their arrival at the police-office, the gentleman
immediately handed his card to the magistrate,
to whom he whispered a few words at the same
time; and his worship became all civility and politeness.
The case was called on without a moment’s
delay: the gentleman concisely but effectually explained
the affair of the gilt counter; and the magistrate,
on declaring Julia to be discharged, assured
her that she would leave the court without the
slightest stain on her character. The stranger
placed ten pounds in the magistrate’s hands for the
use of the poor-box, and then departed in company
with Julia, whom he escorted back to the house in
which she dwelt. On reaching the door, he paused,
and taking her hand, said, ‘Miss Murray, I shall
not insult you by offering a pecuniary recompense
for the mortification, annoyance, and distress you
have undergone through that gilt counter. But I
shall endeavour to serve you in another way. Farewell
for the present: you will shortly see me again;
for, be assured,’ he added, gazing earnestly upon
her for a moment, ‘I shall never forget you.’&mdash;Thus
speaking, he pressed her hand and hurried away;&mdash;and
it was not until he had disappeared from her
view that she remembered she was still in profound
ignorance of who or what he was. It, however,
struck her that the case would be again reported
in the newspapers; and she therefore hoped that
the morrow would clear up the mystery. But it
was with some degree of anxiety and painful suspense
that she thus awaited the publication of the
journals of the ensuing day;&mdash;and she could not
account to herself for the feelings that thus agitated
her. Although her character had been completely
cleared from the imputation thrown upon it, and
her innocence was made unquestionably apparent,&mdash;although
she had ample funds, through the generosity
of Lady Caroline Jerningham, to provide for
all present wants,&mdash;and although a secret voice
seemed to whisper in her soul that she possessed a
good friend in the stranger-gentleman,&mdash;yet, somehow
or another, poor Julia was not entirely contented.
Was it that the handsome countenance of
her unknown benefactor had made any impression
on her heart?&mdash;was it that his kind and sympathising
conduct had touched a tender chord in her
pure and innocent bosom? It is impossible to
answer these questions at present: but it is very
certain that Julia experienced a disappointment almost
amounting to a positive shock, when she found
that the morning papers seemed to be in as much
ignorance as herself relative to her unknown benefactor.
The report merely alluded to him as ‘<em>a gentleman
whose name did not transpire</em>;’&mdash;and this
mystery in which her friend evidently wrapped himself,
became a source of secret trouble to the young
dress-maker. Wherefore had he not revealed his
name to her? Disreputable that name could not be;
else how could it have produced so magical an effect
upon the magistrate? Was it, then, a great&mdash;a
famous&mdash;or a noble name? Julia sighed&mdash;and dared
not hazard any conjectures: but in her heart there
suddenly appeared to arise a hope&mdash;a secret wish,
that the stranger was <em>not</em> so very highly exalted
above her own social sphere!</p>

<p>“Again was Julia preparing to sally forth and visit
the various ladies for whom she was accustomed to
work, when her landlady brought her up a note. It
was from Lady Caroline Jerningham, requesting Miss
Murray to call upon her in the evening at a stated hour,
as her ladyship had a quantity of work to place in her
hands. The young maiden was overjoyed at the receipt
of this missive, which not only promised her employment,
but likewise seemed to be an assurance of the
tender interest which the charming Lady Caroline had
taken in her. She did not therefore stir out until the
evening;&mdash;and little Harry was delighted that his sister
remained at home with him. But when the appointed
hour drew near, she tranquillised her brother with a
promise of a speedy return; and away she sped, with
a heart full of hope, towards Hanover Square. On
reaching the splendid mansion occupied by the Dowager-Marchioness,
Julia was received by Lady Caroline’s
own maid, and was forthwith conducted to the chamber
of her fair patroness, who treated her in the most
kind and condescending manner. ‘I regret, Miss
Murray,’ she said, ‘that I am forced to admit you
thus stealthily into the house; but my mother is of
a peculiar temper, although in reality possessed of a
good heart.’&mdash;‘I understand your ladyship,’ returned
Julia: ‘the Marchioness cannot forgive me for what
she considers neglect. I am however deeply grateful
to your ladyship for thinking otherwise, and for
giving me such substantial proofs that you entertain
so favourable an opinion.’&mdash;‘My dear Miss Murray,’
observed Lady Caroline, ‘I will do any thing I can
to serve you; for I can well imagine how grateful
must be the sympathy of a friend to one who is acquainted
with sorrow!’&mdash;These words were uttered
with almost a mournful emphasis, as if the fair speaker
craved that sympathy and friendship for herself
which she proffered to another;&mdash;and Julia could not
help regarding her with mingled surprise, gratitude,
and tender interest. They were alone together&mdash;that
elegant patrician lady and that beautiful milliner,&mdash;the
maid having retired; and it appeared as
if a species of sisterly feeling suddenly sprang up
between them, inspiring them with mutual confidence,
and for the time annihilating the barrier that
social distinctions had raised up between them in
the eyes of the world. Thus was it that when Lady
Caroline saw Julia’s looks fixed upon her in so earnest
and plaintive a manner, she felt herself irresistibly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
urged to respond to that tacit yet eloquent
proffer of sympathy and affection. ‘Ah! my dear
Miss Murray,’ she said, ‘you must not imagine that
unhappiness exists only with those who have to toil
for their daily bread. Perhaps, indeed, their lot is
preferable to that of the rich who have causes of
grief;&mdash;for <em>you</em> have a constant occupation which
allows little leisure for disagreeable reflection;
whereas <em>I</em> have so much time&mdash;&mdash;’.&mdash;Lady Caroline
checked herself, turned away, and hastily passed a
handkerchief across her face. She had perhaps said
more than she intended: for, from speaking of the
richer and poorer classes in general terms, she had
been carried into personal illustration of the truth
of her remarks by pointedly placing herself and
Julia in juxta-position. Miss Murray, though totally
devoid of artfulness, was yet endowed with an
intellect keen enough to perceive this fact: and she
now learnt, then&mdash;as indeed she had previously
suspected&mdash;that Lady Caroline was unhappy. But
it was not for her to invite a revelation of the fair
patrician’s cause of sorrow: she therefore remained
silent.</p>

<div id="i_129" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_129.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“‘Julia,’ said her ladyship, suddenly turning towards
her again, and taking her hand as she thus
spoke,&mdash;‘Julia,’ she repeated, in an earnest, appealing
tone, ‘I will be a friend to you; but it may happen
that I also shall require the aid and sympathy of a
friend&mdash;&mdash;’; and, once more checking herself, she
sighed profoundly.&mdash;‘I would serve you night and
day, dear lady!’ exclaimed the young milliner,
pressing to her lips the hand which still grasped her
own.&mdash;‘I have not read your disposition inaccurately,
dearest girl,’ responded Lady Caroline: then,
assuming a more cheerful tone, she said, ‘Be it understood,
we are friends! And now you must leave
me, as my mother will be enquiring after me.’&mdash;Julia
received a parcel containing a variety of costly
stuffs, which she was to make up into dresses for
her fair patroness, and which would furnish her
with work for at least a month; and, as she was
leaving the room, Lady Caroline said, ‘My own
maid will call upon you every Saturday evening
and bring away whatever you may have finished,
until the whole be complete.’&mdash;They then separated,
Lady Caroline pressing Julia’s hand warmly at parting;
and the young dressmaker hurried homeward,
her heart beating with joy at the kindness which she
had experienced and the friendship she had formed.
‘After all,’ she murmured to herself, as she ascended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
the stair-case to her chamber, where little Harry
was sitting up to await her return.&mdash;‘after all, the
adventure of the spoilt dress has proved a service,
rather than an injury, to me: and perhaps,’ she
added,&mdash;but it was her heart, and not her lips, that
now spoke,&mdash;‘the affair of the gilt counter may
likewise bring me good luck!’</p>

<p>“Julia now addressed herself to the work of
which she had such profusion; and while she sate
plying her needle, with little Harry playing about
the room, she often thought of the handsome unknown.
Every day, after the frugal dinner, she took
her brother out to walk for an hour, that a little
exercise and fresh air might benefit them both; and,
of an evening, when she laid aside her work, she
gave him instruction in many useful branches of
education. During the day, too, he learnt his lessons;
and never did she suffer him to go out alone
into the streets&mdash;no, not even on the slightest
errand. In fact, this excellent young woman took
as much care of her little orphan brother as if she
had been his parent, instead of his sister; and it was
a charming as well as touching sight to behold them
repairing to the parish church on a Sabbath-morning,&mdash;each
attired with so much neatness, and yet
in a plain and unobtrusive manner. Well, three
weeks had passed since the interview between Julia
and Lady Caroline; and on each Saturday evening
her ladyship’s maid called to receive and pay for the
work that was finished. The domestic was sure to
have some pretty present from her mistress for
Julia, and a handsome toy&mdash;such as a transparent
slate, or puzzle, or a miniature carpenter’s tool-box&mdash;for
Harry; and the grateful milliner sent back
her kindest but most respectful regards to her good
patroness. But during those three weeks she had
neither seen nor heard any thing of the handsome
stranger;&mdash;and yet, had he not promised that he
would shortly call again? Wherefore should he
call? Julia never paused to ask herself that question;&mdash;but
she did sometimes admit, within the
secret recesses of her own heart, that she thought
it somewhat unkind he did not fulfil his promise,
after the distress she had endured in consequence
of the mistake he had made respecting the gilt
counter. One day the landlady tapped at Julia’s
door; and, on being desired to enter, the good woman
informed her that ‘<em>the gentleman in the cloak</em>,’
was waiting in the parlour below. A blush instantly
spread itself over Julia’s cheeks; whereupon the
landlady said in a low but impressive tone, ‘you
need not be ashamed of an honest attachment, Miss;
and I know you are too good a girl to form any
other. In fact, I told the gentleman what an excellent
creature you were, and how well you behaved
to your little brother.’&mdash;‘You told him all <em>that</em>?’
exclaimed Julia, looking up in a surprise mingled
with secret pleasure, while the blush upon her
beauteous countenance deepened.&mdash;‘Certainly I did,
Miss,’ replied the landlady: ‘but not to-day. It was
when he called on account of that unpleasant little
affair, you know; and before he sent me up to fetch
you down, he asked no end of questions about you;
and he seemed so pleased when I told him that you
were such a good, industrious young person, and so
kind to your orphan brother; and how you kept
yourself so quiet and respectable, having no acquaintances
scarcely, and certainly no visitors except
your lady-customers or their maids.’&mdash;‘But the
gentleman did not ask all those questions?’ said
Julia, in a hesitating manner and with a tremulous
voice, while her heart palpitated with emotions of
unknown pleasure.&mdash;‘Indeed he did, Miss,’ returned
the landlady. ‘But, dear me! now I think of it, he
charged me not to tell you that he had asked any
thing at all concerning you: and by the same token,
he gave me a sovereign to hold my tongue in this
respect; and therefore, Miss, you must not even
<em>look</em> as if you knew a syllable of what occurred on
that occasion. I am sure he is some great person
in disguise; and I am also certain that he has fallen
in love with you.’&mdash;Julia’s countenance now became
scarlet; and she was about to make a remonstrative
reply, when little Harry, who began to grow impatient
of so much mysterious whispering between
his sister and the landlady, approached them, saying,
‘Is any thing the matter, dear Julia?’&mdash;‘Nothing,
my darling boy,’ was the cheerful reply: ‘I shall
return in a few minutes;’&mdash;and Julia hastened down
stairs, the landlady remaining with Harry.</p>

<p>“Though the young maiden endeavoured to compose
herself as much as possible, yet all that the
landlady had told her rushed to her mind with renewed
force and stronger significancy just as she
crossed the threshold of the parlour and appeared in
the presence of <em>the gentleman in the cloak</em>. He
observed her confusion&mdash;noticed the blush that
mantled on her cheeks&mdash;and, mistaking the cause
said, as he took her hand, ‘I am afraid, Miss Murray,
that you consider it indiscreet for me thus to
pay my respects to you; and indeed, that fear has
prevented me from calling sooner.’&mdash;Julia started,
cast down her eyes, and made no reply; for in her
artless innocence, it had never before struck her that,
an evil construction might be placed upon the visits
of the gentleman: but now the conviction that such
was indeed the result to be apprehended, was forced&mdash;yes,
painfully forced&mdash;upon her sensitive mind.
The stranger read what was passing in her imagination;
and if he were delighted to observe that the
danger which he had specified was previously unsuspected
by her ingenuous soul, he was not the
less gratified to acquire the certainty that her pure
thoughts were shocked by the idea of compromising
her reputation.&mdash;‘Fear not, Miss Murray,’ he continued,
again taking her hand; ‘I should be the last
person on the face of the earth to do you a wilful
injury in any way. I have merely called, as in duty
bound, to assure myself that you have perfectly recovered
from the effects of the distressing ordeal
through which you were compelled to pass in consequence
of my carelessness. But innocence, Miss
Murray,’ he added, emphatically, ‘will invariably
triumph in the long run; and virtue will not ever
languish unrewarded. Your exemplary conduct,
Miss Murray, must sooner or later be adequately
recompensed: your tenderness towards your orphan
brother must ensure for you the esteem and respect
of all liberal and honest persons. May I request,
as a particular favour, that you will presently call
on Mr. Richardson, the solicitor, in Berners Street,
close by; as I know that he has some tidings, of
rather an agreeable character, to impart to you.’&mdash;With
these words, the stranger pressed the young
maiden’s hand, and respectfully took his leave of
her.</p>

<p>“Julia hastened back to her own chamber, and
related to the worthy, well-meaning, but garrulous
landlady, every thing that <em>the gentleman in the cloak</em>
had said to her. ‘Ah! Miss,’ cried the woman, ‘I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
seemed to have a fore-knowledge that something
good was to happen to you; and now I am sure of
it. But pray make haste and see what the lawyer
wants with you.’&mdash;Julia did not require to be pressed
upon this point: she herself was too anxious to
solve this new mystery to permit any unnecessary
delay to take place; and, having dressed little
Harry in his Sunday apparel, she put on her best
bonnet and shawl, and away the sister went with
her little brother to the lawyer’s. They entered an
office in which there were a great many clerks, who
all left off writing to turn round and have a look at
the pretty young lady&mdash;for a lady did Julia really
seem, as she actually was by birth, education, and
manners;&mdash;but when she timidly mentioned her
name, she found herself the object of the most respectful
attention. The head clerk ushered her and
her brother into a handsome apartment, where an
elderly gentleman, with a benevolent countenance,
was seated at a desk covered with papers; and the
reception which he gave Julia Murray was more
than courteous&mdash;it was cordial and, as it were, paternally
kind. ‘Sit down, young lady,’ he said, handing
her to a chair: ‘and you, my little fellow, place
yourself near your sister. And now, Miss Murray,’
he continued, raising his large silver spectacles from
his eyes to his forehead, ‘I have some good news
to communicate to you; and I am sure, after all I
have heard of you, I am proud and happy to be the
medium of conveying any thing agreeable to your
ears.’&mdash;‘You are very kind, sir,’ murmured the
young maiden, still in the deepest suspense.&mdash;‘Did
you ever hear your late father speak of any one who
owed him a sum of money?’ enquired the lawyer.&mdash;Julia
reflected for a few moments, and then replied
in the negative.&mdash;‘Well, perhaps he did not mention
his private affairs before you,’ observed the lawyer;
‘it is nevertheless a fact, that many years ago he advanced
a certain sum to a friend who was in difficulties;
but these embarrassments continued, ending
in bankruptcy or something of the sort; and so
your poor father lost the whole amount thus advanced.
The friend went abroad; and he has latterly
returned to England, a rich man&mdash;having retrieved
his fortunes in a foreign clime. He made
enquiries after your parents, and to his sorrow
learnt that they were no more; but he could not
succeed in tracing you out. At length he saw a report
of a certain case in the newspaper, and ascertained
that you were the young lady therein mentioned.
His sorrow at the first appearance of the
affair was only equalled by his joy when he beheld
the result; for he has your interest deeply at heart.
He has, however, been compelled to leave London
in a great hurry;&mdash;but before he went away, he gave
me certain instructions, which I have fulfilled with
all possible despatch. The sum which he borrowed
of your father, with compound interest, amounts
to six hundred pounds; and this money I have laid
out for you in the purchase of a neat little house,
with good, serviceable furniture, in Camden Town.
There is an excellent young gentlemen’s school
close by; and my client has paid a year in advance
for Master Harry’s tuition. He also intends that you
shall be at no expense for the boy’s education.
Over and above all this, I am instructed to place
these fifty pounds in your hands; and if my client
has thus done more than his actual liability to your
father required, it is simply as a recompense for the
long delay which has occurred in refunding a loan
so generously advanced and so vitally necessary to
him at the time. Now, my dear young lady, I have
no more to say, farther than that this card furnishes
the address of your house, of which I likewise
present you the key; and may this little gleam
of good fortune encourage you to pursue the course
which has hitherto won for you so much esteem,
and which may yet lead you to the highest pinnacle
of happiness and prosperity.’&mdash;With these words,
the kind-hearted man shook Julia warmly by the
hand; the young maiden endeavoured to express
her heart-felt gratitude for the unexpected benefits
thus showered upon her: but tears&mdash;tears of happiness
flowed down her cheeks&mdash;and her bosom was
so full of strange and conflicting emotions, that her
powers of utterance were suspended. Even as she
took up the bank notes, the key, and the card, and
thrust them all together into her little silk bag, her
hands trembled so that she could scarcely perform
those simple acts; and when in a few minutes she
found herself walking along the street, with little
Harry by her side, she could not remember leaving
the lawyer’s office. She fancied that she had been
giving way to some wild hallucination&mdash;some absurd
delusion of the brain: but when she felt in her
bag, <em>there</em> were the proofs of the reality!</p>

<p>“It was no easy task to make little Harry comprehend
the altered nature of their circumstances.
He could not conceive how his sister had possibly
obtained a house of her own, and fancied that she
was joking with him; for he had not been able to
understand very much of what the lawyer had said
to Julia. However, all doubts on the boy’s part
vanished, when he heard his sister explain to their
landlady every thing that had taken place at Mr.
Richardson’s, and conclude by requesting that good
woman to accompany her forthwith to Camden
Town. This desire was complied with; and away
they all three went in a cab to the address designated
upon the card. In due time the vehicle drew
up opposite a neat house forming one of a terrace
recently built; and the little party entered the
dwelling with the least possible delay. It was all
new from top to bottom,&mdash;the furniture, which was
substantial and good, was new likewise;&mdash;the hangings
to the windows and the carpets had been
selected with admirable taste in reference to the
colour and pattern of the paper on the walls:&mdash;in
fact, the abode was fitted up in the most comfortable
manner! ‘I congratulate you, my dear Miss Murray,’
exclaimed her companion; ‘and I am sure I
am as delighted as yourself, although I shall lose
you as a lodger. But you do not, then, think that
it was <em>the gentleman in the cloak</em> who has done all
this?’&mdash;‘No,’ answered Julia; ‘that cannot be, because
I am sure the gentleman you speak of never
knew my father; and moreover the kind friend
who has thus handsomely repaid the money my
father lent him, has gone out of town.’&mdash;‘Then
how came <em>the gentleman in the cloak</em> to call and tell
you, Miss, that the lawyer wished to see you?’&mdash;‘Ah!
I never thought of <em>that</em>!’ exclaimed Julia.
‘And yet,’ she added, after a few moments’ serious
reflection, ‘Mr. Richardson said that my father’s
debtor had found me out through the medium of
the newspaper report; and this circumstance may
have brought him and <em>the gentleman in the cloak</em> together.’&mdash;‘True!’
ejaculated the garrulous woman.
‘Oh! what a sweet place this is, to be sure!’&mdash;‘It
is too good for me,’ said Julia, in a mournful tone,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the first feelings of delight now yielding to sober
reflection: ‘the occupant of such a house as this
requires a servant, and should possess a certain income;
whereas I cannot afford the former, not possessing
the latter.’&mdash;‘Oh! Miss, are you blind to all
the advantages now spread before your eyes?’ demanded
the woman. ‘Here you are in your own
house, rent free, and with fifty pounds in your
pocket&mdash;Harry’s schooling to be paid into the bargain!
All your kind patronesses will give you as
much work as you can possibly manage, now that
they will see how you are getting on in the world;
and the number of your customers must increase.
Then you can have the assistance of one or two
respectable young girls; and you will not only obtain
a good living, but be able to save money.’&mdash;Julia
saw the truth of these observations; and
her heart was relieved from a heavy load.&mdash;‘Besides,’
said the talkative but well-meaning woman,
’it would seem like flying in the face of Providence
not to be thankful for such bounties.’&mdash;‘Yes,’
ejaculated Julia, touched more profoundly by this
remark than by the worldly reasoning previously
advanced by her companion: ‘I <em>do</em> sincerely and
firmly believe that <span class="smcap">He</span>, who watches all our ways
and knows all our steps, has taken compassion upon
me and my darling brother; and I receive in thankfulness
the blessings thus showered upon me!’&mdash;Thus
speaking, the young maiden turned aside for a
few moments; and heart-felt though short was the
prayer which she breathed in silence to the Almighty
Ruler of the Universe!</p>

<p>“On the following day Julia and her little
brother removed to their new house. It would be
vain to attempt to describe the joy and delight experienced
by little Harry at this change, the more
so inasmuch as there was a large piece of ground
attached to the back part of the dwelling, where he
could play when the weather was fine. Through
the agency of her late landlady, a poor widow-woman,
of middle age, steady habits, and great respectability,
was recommended to Julia as servant
or housekeeper; and thus commenced the economy
of the little household. Julia’s first care was to
address a note to all her kind patronesses to acquaint
them with her removal; and Lady Caroline
Jerningham was not forgotten. Harry commenced
his attendance at the neighbouring school, the
master of which called upon Miss Murray and informed
her that he had received from Mr. Richardson
a year’s payment in advance for the boy’s
tuition; and the preceptor being a kind, worthy
man, Harry soon became a great favourite with him.
Several weeks passed away; and it was astonishing
how Julia’s business increased. Carriages were
constantly stopping at her door, the number of her
patronesses rapidly augmenting; and, on enquiry,
she usually found that the new recommendations
emanated from Lady Caroline, who appeared, by
these results, to be constantly thinking of her
friend, the young milliner. In fact, Julia had so
much work upon her hands that she was compelled
to give a great portion out to respectable needle-women
in the neighbourhood; for she preferred
this mode of fulfilling her engagements, rather than
by taking assistants into the house.</p>

<p>“Four months had thus passed away; and during
this interval Julia had never once seen <em>the gentleman
in the cloak</em>; nor had she received a visit from her
father’s debtor, to whose honesty and generosity she
owed so much. She called once upon Mr. Richardson
to express a hope that the individual thus
alluded to would give her an opportunity of thanking
him personally; but the lawyer assured her,
and, as she thought, somewhat abruptly, that he
had left the country on a long voyage; and she returned
home, much vexed at the tidings she had
received. One evening&mdash;it was a Saturday evening,
and at about nine o’clock&mdash;a cab stopped at the
door, and a double-knock immediately announced
some visitor. It happened that the housekeeper was
absent on a visit of two or three days to some relations
in the country&mdash;the girl who had been temporarily
hired to do her work, and who did not sleep
in the house, had gone for the night&mdash;and Harry
was in bed in his own little room adjoining his
sister’s bed-chamber up-stairs. Julia was accordingly
compelled to answer the door herself; and her
surprise was only equalled by her delight, when she
found that her visitress was Lady Caroline Jerningham,
who had arrived thus mysteriously in a common
street-cab, which she had dismissed on alighting at her
young friend’s house. Miss Murray received her with
the most sincere manifestations of joy, and conducted
her into the parlour, where a cheerful fire was burning
in the grate; for though it was now the month of
April, yet the evenings had not entirely lost the
chill of winter. You must remember that Julia had
not seen Lady Caroline since that evening when the
latter sent for her to the mansion in Hanover Square,
and on which occasion they had exchanged vows of
friendship. Nearly five months had passed since
that date; and it struck Julia, as the light of the
candles flashed upon the fair patrician’s countenance,
that she was much altered. Her face was pale
and care-worn; and her eyes beamed not with their
wonted fires. ‘My dear Julia,’ she said, seating her
self near the fire, ‘I had intended to call upon you
long ago; but I have been ill and suffering, in mind
and body. However,’ she added, hastily, ‘I have
never once forgotten you; and I am delighted to
find that your business has prospered so well.’&mdash;‘I
am under obligations to your ladyship which I
can never repay,’ exclaimed Julia, taking the patrician’s
hand, and conveying it to her lips.&mdash;‘Do not
address me in that formal style, Julia,’ said Lady
Caroline. ‘My God!’ she cried, bitterly, ‘would
that I were <em>not</em> of noble birth: would that I were
a daughter of toil; for <em>then</em> I should not have the
thousand Argus-eyes of <em>the world</em> upon me!’&mdash;and
she clasped her hands in a manner indicative of deep
mental anguish.&mdash;‘Dearest Lady Caroline,’ exclaimed
Julia, ‘what ails you? Oh! tell me, and show me
how I may minister to you in your sufferings!’&mdash;‘You
once assured me, Julia, <em>that you would serve
me by day and by night</em>,’ said Lady Caroline, speaking
in a low and almost hollow tone, and casting
anxious glances around as if she were afraid of being
overheard.&mdash;‘Yes, dearest lady,’ returned Julia,
emphatically; ‘and I renew that pledge! By day
and by night can you command me.’&mdash;‘Are we in
danger of intrusion?’ demanded Lady Caroline
anxiously.&mdash;‘Not in the least, dear lady: excepting
my little brother, who is asleep in his own chamber,
we are alone in the house.’&mdash;‘Heaven be thanked!’
ejaculated Caroline Jerningham, speaking as if at
least some portion of the heavy weight that lay
upon her heart, were removed by this assurance.&mdash;‘My
generous friend,’ said Julia, ‘I see that you
have a terrible but secret cause of grief; make me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
your confidant, I implore you! If I can aid you, I
shall rejoice indeed to have the opportunity of
proving my gratitude for all the kindness I have
received at your hands; and if I cannot assist, I
may at least be able to console you!’&mdash;‘Dearest
Julia, I do indeed require a friend at this moment;
for surely never was wretched woman in such
dreadful embarrassment as myself! For the last
few weeks I have lived only like one distracted&mdash;keeping
my chamber, and affecting an illness,
though steadily refusing to receive the advice of
the family physician! And now, fortunately my
mother has gone on a visit for a few days to some
friends in the country; and my own maid is in my
confidence and is trustworthy. Thus my absence
from home will not be suspected; and in this is
now my only hope! O Julia, Julia&mdash;can you not
understand my meaning?’&mdash;then, casting herself at
the feet of the young milliner, the almost heart-broken
Lady Caroline exclaimed, in the wildest
paroxysm of bitter, bitter grief, as she joined her
hands imploringly, ‘Save my honour, Julia&mdash;save my
reputation,&mdash;and by so doing you save my life: for
I would perish by my own hand rather than endure
exposure!’&mdash;‘My God! dearest lady, what do you
mean?’ demanded Julia, fearful lest her friend’s
senses were leaving her, and that she was uttering
meaningless phrases in the incipient aberration of
the intellect: ‘tell me, how can I save you in any
way? for you know that you may depend upon me
to the utmost!’&mdash;‘How can you save me!’ repeated
the agonising young lady, in a voice of the most
plaintive appeal: ‘Oh! do you not comprehend my
condition, Julia? And yet I am about to become a
mother!’</p>

<p>“These words fell with stupefying, astounding
effect upon the ears of Julia Murray: indeed, she
could scarcely believe that she had rightly interpreted
their meaning. The unhappy Caroline mistook
the cause of the young milliner’s silence and
amazement; and, rising from her suppliant posture,
she exclaimed, while the proud patrician blood
rushed to her cheeks, ‘I understand you, Miss: you
are shocked at the announcement I have made, and
you are indignant that I should apply to you to
screen me. I will drag myself away from your
house, therefore; imploring you only to keep the
secret which I have been so foolish, so inconsiderate
to reveal to you.’&mdash;‘Just heaven! what do I hear?
reproaches from your lips!’ cried Julia; and embracing
the unhappy lady with sisterly warmth, she
said, ‘No, no: you have misunderstood me! Grief
and surprise for a moment sealed my lips: but you
find me ready to succour you, dearest benefactress,
to the utmost of my power!’&mdash;‘Thank you, kind
friend,’ murmured Lady Caroline, falling back exhausted
into her seat; for the agitated state of her
feelings, and the harrowing emotions which the
dread of Julia’s coldness had just caused her to experience,
produced effects of a most perilous nature.
The young milliner knew not how to act: she was
bewildered; and, wringing her hands, exclaimed,
‘Oh! what shall I do? how can I aid her?’&mdash;Lady
Caroline partially recovered her presence of mind
as these words fell upon her ears; and giving a few
hasty instructions, these were instantly obeyed.
Julia conducted, or rather supported her to her
own bed-chamber; and then, throwing on her bonnet
and shawl, hurried away to fetch the nearest
surgeon. The medical man whom she sought was
at home; and he accompanied the milliner to the
house, where he arrived just at the moment that
his services were required. In a word, Lady Caroline
Jerningham that night became the mother of
a fine boy, although the birth was premature by
nearly a month, and she had risked much by the
necessity of adopting the indispensable means in regard
to dress to conceal her situation for many
weeks past.</p>

<p>“The surgeon, who had every reason to be satisfied
with the liberality of Julia on behalf of her unhappy
friend, and who was moreover a discreet man,
perceived that his patient was a young lady of
superior grade in society, and therefore volunteered
his aid in ensuring the concealment of the affair.
In fact, he stated that he was acquainted with a
poor woman in the neighbourhood, who, having just
lost her own infant, would be delighted to take
charge of the newly-born babe. Lady Caroline was
so far recovered as to be able to take part in this
conference; and, without suffering the slightest
hint to transpire as to who she was, she nevertheless
intimated her readiness and ability to remunerate
in the most liberal manner those who might be
instrumental in completing the arrangement suggested.
The surgeon accordingly undertook the
settlement of the business; and, after an hour’s
absence, he returned, accompanied by a young,
good-looking, healthy woman, who was willing to
embrace the proposal that had been made to her.
She was married to a labouring man; her name was
Porter; and she lived at the distance of about half
a mile from Julia’s house. Lady Caroline had a
well-filled purse; but even if the contrary had been
the case, her friend the milliner could have supplied
the funds required. As it was, the young
mother gave Mrs. Porter twenty pounds in advance;
and having mentioned a feigned name and address,
when questioned on that point, Lady Caroline
parted with her babe&mdash;though not without many a
bitter pang and a torrent of heart-wrung tears!</p>

<p>“That was a wretched night for poor Julia Murray.
In the warmth of her gratitude and friendship,
she had become an accomplice in what she fancied,
when she had leisure for sober reflection, to be something
bordering upon the nature of a crime. Her
pure soul shrank from the idea of the unnatural
abandonment by a mother of her child to the mercy
of a stranger, rendered necessary even though the
proceeding were by the peculiar circumstances in
which that mother was placed. Moreover, the readiness
with which Lady Caroline had given a false
name and address had somewhat shocked the truth-loving
Julia;&mdash;and then she feared lest the whole
matter should by any possibility become known, and
compromise her own reputation. All these thoughts
and apprehensions swept across her mind, after the
surgeon and Mrs. Porter had taken their departure,
and while Lady Caroline slept. But the generous
girl strove to banish from her mind reflections which
tended to diminish her respect for the patrician lady
who had manifested so much kindness towards her:
moreover, the natural feelings of a woman towards
one of her own sex placed in such interesting though
embarrassing, not to say <em>alarming</em> circumstances,&mdash;the
sentiments of commiseration, deep sympathy, and
tender friendship, soon triumphed over all other
considerations;&mdash;and when Caroline awoke, just as
the grey dawn of morning was breaking into the
chamber, she found the young milliner watching by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
her bedside. The suffering lady was considerably
refreshed and strengthened by the long sleep she
had enjoyed: her mind was moreover relieved from
the most excruciating anxieties:&mdash;and she poured
forth her gratitude to Julia Murray in the most sincere
and heartfelt manner. Then, in the fulness of
the tender confidence which had arisen between
them, Caroline told her friend how she had loved
her cousin, a young lieutenant in the Navy,&mdash;how
their union was forbidden by her proud mother
though assented to by her generous brother, the
Marquis of Wilmington,&mdash;how her mother had used
her interest privately to get the young man appointed
to a ship and sent to sea with only a few days’ warning,&mdash;and
how, in the anguish of parting, she&mdash;Lady
Caroline&mdash;had fallen a victim to her fatal passion!
This narrative moved Julia to tears;&mdash;for the
young milliner now comprehended what love was&mdash;and
she felt that she also loved,&mdash;and that when she
sorrowed in secret at the protracted absence of the
stranger who had given her the gilt counter, it was
in consequence of the impression which he had made
upon her heart! Thus did Julia Murray at length
obtain the reading of the mysterious sensations that
stirred within her own soul.</p>

<p>“Fortunately there was a means of egress from
little Harry’s room, without the necessity of the boy’s
passing through his sister’s chamber; and thus was
the presence of Lady Caroline retained a profound
secret from him. You must also recollect that the
incidents just related occurred on the Saturday
night; and Harry had by chance received an invitation
to pass the Sunday with his schoolmaster’s
family. Every circumstance thus appeared to favour
the complete concealment of Lady Caroline’s confinement.
But it was now necessary that Julia should
repair to the mansion in Hanover Square, and acquaint
the young lady’s confidential maid with the
event which had taken place, as well as to arrange
for Caroline’s unobserved return home on the Monday
evening;&mdash;for though at the risk of her life, she
was resolved to remain away no longer than the
time specified. This commission Julia faithfully
performed; and after an absence of upwards of two
hours, she reached her own abode once more. The
patient was improving rapidly; and when the surgeon
called a second time on that Sunday, he was
astonished to find her so strong and in the possession
of so much physical and moral energy. To be
brief, on the Monday evening, according to agreement,
Lady Caroline, well wrapped up, disguised in
the attire of a daughter of the middle class, and with
a dark green veil drawn carefully over her countenance,
accompanied Julia in a hackney-coach to
Hanover Square; and the two were admitted into
the mansion, the hall-porter believing his young
mistress to be a friend and equal of the milliner. In
this manner they reached Caroline’s own chamber
without the truth being for an instant suspected;
and the confidential maid was in readiness to receive
her lady. Julia remained there until the maid had
ascertained that the hall-porter had been relieved by
another domestic during the supper-hour; and then
the milliner took her departure, accompanied by the
fervent gratitude and blessings of the fair patrician
whom she had thus extricated from a maze of the
most frightful difficulties.</p>

<p>“The very next morning, while Julia was seated
at work in her parlour, reflecting upon the incidents
of the three preceding days, she heard the iron gate
in front of the house groan upon its hinges; and,
looking up, she beheld from the window the tall,
handsome gentleman approaching the door. The
day was fine; and he no longer wore his cloak;&mdash;and
his garb was plain, unpretending, and perfectly
genteel. The housekeeper having returned home
that same morning, Julia awaited with a beating
heart in the parlour the presence of her visitor; and
when he entered, she felt so confused&mdash;for a variety
of reasons&mdash;that she could not utter a word. In the
first place she knew that she loved him;&mdash;secondly
she remembered all the enquiries he had put to her
late landlady concerning her;&mdash;and thirdly, she
recalled to mind the gentle, good, and almost
paternal way in which he had addressed her when
last they met; and she fancied that in her conduct
respecting Lady Caroline she had deviated
somewhat from the strict line of integrity, truth,
and virtue for pursuing which he had so emphatically
commended her, and in which he had with equal
earnestness enjoined her to persevere. Taking her
hand, he said, ‘Miss Murray, have you completely
forgotten me?’&mdash;‘Oh! no, sir,’ she cried, with a
start as if at an imputation of ingratitude: ‘that
were impossible!’&mdash;‘And yet why should you remember
me?’ he asked, gazing intently upon her:
’have I ever done you any service that deserves a
thought? The only incident which is likely to dwell
in your mind respecting me, is the wretchedness
and embarrassment to which my thoughtless conduct
exposed you. But for all that you then endured,
have I ever made you the slightest recompense?’&mdash;‘Oh!
sir,’ cried Julia, the blood rushing
to her cheeks, ‘do you think for a moment that I
ever sought or looked for a pecuniary indemnification?
Heavens, how have you mistaken my character!’&mdash;and
she burst into tears. The stranger
gazed upon her, and even smiled as if in satisfaction:
but he said nothing.&mdash;‘No, sir,’ resumed the young
milliner, hastily passing her handkerchief across
her countenance and wiping away the traces of her
grief; ‘I am not a mercenary person, such as you
appear to suppose me. I <em>did</em> remember you <em>with
gratitude</em>,’ she continued, her voice becoming mournful
and plaintive in spite of herself; ‘because you
spoke kindly to me on that evening when the accident
occurred to the silk dress&mdash;because you proffered
me assistance at a moment when I and my
little brother really needed it&mdash;because I always
believed and still believe that it was on your part
entirely an error which led me into such a serious
difficulty&mdash;because you <em>then</em> told me that you would
not insult me by offering me any pecuniary recompense&mdash;and
because, when you called again, you
spoke kindly to me as before, gave me good advice,
and also brought me intelligence from Mr. Richardson,
which has led to my present prosperity. For
all these reasons, sir,’ she added emphatically, ‘I
have thought of you often and often; and I considered
myself to be deeply your debtor.’&mdash;‘Excellent
girl!’ exclaimed the gentleman, surveying her
with mingled admiration and interest: ‘not for
worlds would I insult your feelings, nor wound
your generous heart! And it was precisely through
delicacy in those respects, that I never did openly
proffer you any pecuniary assistance, since that one
unfortunate occasion in Hanover Square. Again,
let me observe, that if I have not visited you for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
four long months, I have not been unmindful of
your welfare. I have, as it were, watched over you
from a distance; and I have learnt with supreme
satisfaction, that your conduct <em>has</em> continued most
exemplary. Miss Murray, I am perhaps singular
and eccentric in my notions; and, though highly
placed in the social sphere, yet I have determined
to consult only my own happiness, at least for the
future, in the most important step which a man can
adopt in life. I allude to marriage.’&mdash;Julia started,
blushed, and cast down her eyes; and this confusion
on her part seemed to encourage her visitor to proceed.&mdash;‘I
must candidly inform you,’ he resumed,
’that I have been a husband already, and that the
alliance which I formed almost in my boyhood, and
in obedience to the dictates of an imperious mother,
was an unhappy one. My wife was a heartless coquette&mdash;vain&mdash;frivolous&mdash;and
possessing no <em>mind</em>.
I sought by gentleness and kindness to render her
attached to her home, although I never really loved
her; but all was useless. At last she caught a
severe cold when returning from a rout, early on
a winter’s morning; and a rapid decline soon carried
her to the tomb. This occurred two years ago.
I then vowed that if I should ever contract a second
union, it must be where the heart alone was interested.
This resolve I declared to my mother; and
it has in a measure, I regret to say it, incensed her
against me. The very first time I ever saw you, I
felt myself suddenly and mysteriously attracted towards
you. All that I have since heard or seen of
you has tended to confirm that favourable impression;
and I am come this morning to offer you my
hand, as you already possess my heart.’</p>

<p>“A faintness&mdash;an indescribable sensation of mingled
joy and apprehension came over Julia, as these
last words met her ears,&mdash;joy in the hope that she
had heard aright, apprehension lest she were the
prey of a delightful vision which was too soon to be
dissipated. But when she felt her hand pressed to
the lips of that handsome suitor who now knelt at
her feet, and listened to the tender assurances of an
honourable and lasting affection which he breathed
with manly sincerity in her ears, she exclaimed,
under the sudden impulse of her heart’s emotions,
‘Is it possible that so much happiness can be in
store for me?’&mdash;Her suitor received those words as
an assent to his proposal; and, pressing the young
maiden to his bosom, he said, ‘Then without knowing
my name you have loved me, dearest Julia?’&mdash;She
murmured an affirmative; and a rapid interchange
of questions and replies convinced him that
the young maiden had all along remembered him not
<em>with gratitude</em>, but <em>with affection</em>! Thereupon, seating
himself by her side, and retaining her pretty
hand in his, he said, ‘Then henceforth, Julia, there
need exist no mystery on my part. I am the pretended
debtor to your deceased father; and Mr.
Richardson, my own attorney, followed my secret
instructions in providing for yourself and your
brother. My object was to place you in comfort, yet
still leave you in a condition that rendered you to a
certain degree dependant on your own honest industry;
and I have been overjoyed to find that prosperity
has not induced you to relax your energies,
nor led you into extravagances, nor in any way
proved injurious to your fair fame, your amiable
disposition, and your steady perseverance. With
delight, then, shall I accompany so worthy a woman
to the altar; and with pride shall I present you to
the world as the Marchioness of Wilmington!’&mdash;‘Oh!
my lord,’ murmured Julia, a greater faintness
than before now coming over her, as the lofty rank
of her suitor was thus announced to her, ‘is it possible
that you can be the brother of that young lady
to whom I owe so much?’&mdash;and then she blushed
deeply, and a cold shudder passed over her frame as
she remembered what a tremendous secret she had
retained in her bosom, and must retain inviolably
concerning the sister of him who offered to make
her the partner of his rank and fortune.&mdash;‘Yes,’
said the marquis, attributing her emotions to the
happiness as well as the maidenly confusion which
it was natural for her to experience under existing
circumstances; ‘that Lady Caroline whom you
know, is my sister. You may judge my surprise
when, on the night that I first encountered you in
Hanover Square, you informed me that the spoilt
dress was my mother’s. The very next morning I
called at her residence and privately acquainted
Caroline with the little adventure, casually saying
that I had been a witness of the accident which was
occasioned through no neglect nor carelessness on
your part, and desiring her when you presented
yourself to mitigate as much as possible my mother’s
certain resentment against you. Since that period
my sister has frequently spoken to me concerning
you, and has recommended you extensively to her
numerous fashionable acquaintances. But, much as
I love and would trust Lady Caroline, I have never
informed her of the attachment I experienced for
you, nor of the fact that I was your father’s pretended
debtor. This reserve originated merely in
the determination to watch your conduct,&mdash;I may
tell you all this now, dear girl,&mdash;from a distance;
so that time might decide whether I should lay my
coronet at your feet, or renounce all farther idea of
an alliance with you. Thank, heaven! the former is
the happy destiny; and now I have explained all
that may have seemed strange or mysterious in your
estimation.’</p>

<p>“Julia could scarcely find words to express her
gratitude for all the delicate attentions and generous
acts of which the nobleman had thus been the
hitherto unknown author: but he sealed her lips
with a fond kiss, and then proceeded to address her
in the following manner:&mdash;‘I propose, dearest girl,
that our union shall take place in six months from
the present time. The reason that I suggest so long
a delay is that I may visit you occasionally, in company
with my sister, be it understood, so that you
may learn to know me better than you now do; and
as I shall at once make a confidant of Caroline, and
am well acquainted with the generosity of her disposition,
you need not apprehend any coolness or
hostility on her part. Quite the contrary: she will
love you as a sister. Ah! I observe that you sigh
and experience an agitation of feeling, my Julia; but
you have no cause to dread any exhibition of foolish
pride with Caroline. Relative to my mother, I say
nothing&mdash;promise nothing: at the same time I cannot
permit her will to rule my happiness. And now I
shall take my leave of you for the present, Julia;
and I shall at once hasten to Hanover Square, to
confide all that has occurred between us to my
sister, who, I regret to state, has been confined for
some days past to her own chamber. Alas! she,
poor girl, has suffered in her best and holiest affections
through her mother’s pride; but I rejoice to say
that happiness awaits her yet. By the sudden death
of a young cousin, Lieutenant Quentin has become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Lord Hartley, and his ship will return in a few
months to England. This most unexpected succession
to title and wealth, will smooth down all
the difficulties which my mother has hitherto interposed
in the way of her daughter’s happiness; and
who knows, Julia,’ added the marquis, smiling, ‘but
that the two marriages may be celebrated at the
same time?’&mdash;‘God grant that they may!’ exclaimed
the young milliner, with a strange emphasis; then,
immediately afterwards she observed, ‘For, believe
me, I have your sister’s happiness most sincerely at
heart.’&mdash;‘I shall not fail to tell Caroline all you
say,’ returned the marquis; ‘and she will be prepared
to love you the more tenderly. And now,
dear Julia,’ he added, rising to depart, ‘I must bid
you farewell for the present. The next time I call
I shall give you due notice beforehand, so that you
may have little Harry here to see me. But permit
me, before I depart, to request you to divest yourself
by degrees of the business and occupations
which have accumulated upon you. To speak
plainly, you need receive no more work from any
person; and you will permit my solicitor, Mr.
Richardson, to supply you monthly with such sums
as you may require for your expenditure.’&mdash;All this
was said by Lord Wilmington in so delicate yet
tender a manner, that it increased Julia’s attachment
to him, as well as her high esteem of his character;
and they parted, more than ever pleased
with each other.</p>

<p>“In the afternoon, Julia was sitting at her work,
pondering upon all that had occurred, and scarcely
able yet to convince herself that she was not a prey
to some delusive vision, when Lady Caroline’s maid
called with a note from her mistress. In this <em>billet</em>
the fair patrician said, ‘<em>My brother has told me all,
dearest Julia; and believe me when I assure you, that
it will afford me unfeigned delight to hail you as a
sister. Never, never can I forget all your goodness
towards me in the hour of my bitter extremity. But,
for heaven’s sake! guard well my secret! This injunction,
however, I need scarcely give you. And yet,
there is one thing which now affects me; this is&mdash;&mdash;shall
you not blush to acknowledge</em> <small>ME</small> <em>as your sister-in-law,
since you are acquainted with my disgrace? My
heart tells me that you commiserate and sympathise:
but my fears&mdash;Oh! until I receive from you an assurance
that may calm them&mdash;those fears are truly painful!</em>’&mdash;The
generous Julia hastened to pen a reply, conveying
in the tenderest terms the assurance solicited;
and, having ascertained that the young lady was progressing
rapidly towards complete convalescence,
she dismissed the maid with the letter entrusted to
her. Three weeks, however, elapsed before Lady
Caroline was sufficiently recovered to call upon her
friend Julia; and then she came alone&mdash;for her mother’s
heart yearned to visit her child. Under the
influence of this feeling, she was moved to tears
when she learnt that every alternate day Miss Murray
had made it a point to call at Mrs. Porter’s residence
and assure herself that the poor babe was duly
cared for. ‘This is another proof of your goodness,
Julia!’ exclaimed Lady Caroline, falling upon her
friend’s neck and weeping with mingled gratitude
and joy. They presently proceeded together to
the good woman’s abode; and the young mother
was charmed to find her child thriving to her
heart’s best satisfaction. On the following day
Lady Caroline revisited Julia; but this time it
was in company with her brother the Marquis;&mdash;and
little Harry was at home to see them. You may
suppose that the party was a happy one; and it gave
the nobleman ineffable delight to observe that his
sister and his intended wife were on the best possible
terms with each other. But he little suspected
the tremendous secret that had thus cemented their
friendship;&mdash;and it cost poor Julia many a pang
when she reflected that she was compelled to retain
any secret at all from the knowledge of the generous
man who reposed such confidence in her! There
was however no help for it;&mdash;and yet Julia felt as
if she were acting with blameable duplicity in veiling
a circumstance which for her friend’s sake, she would
nevertheless rather die than reveal: and after her
noble visitors had taken their departure, she did
not experience that amount of happiness which,
with her present brilliant prospects, she knew she
ought to enjoy.</p>

<p>“I must not dwell upon this portion of my narrative.
Let us suppose five months to have passed
away; during which period the marquis had been
constant in his visits to Julia, but always in the
company of his sister. So delicate was his behaviour
in respect to the reputation of his intended
bride, that he avoided every chance of compromising
her; and although the neighbours saw a gentleman,
whose name they did not know, call three
times a-week upon the beautiful milliner, they
never beheld him repair thither alone. Thus there
was no scope for scandal; and Julia’s conduct was
always so circumspect as to prove a complete antidote
to calumny. I should observe that during the
five months mentioned, the attachment subsisting
between the pair increased, and warmed into the
most ardent love; and I must not forget to state
that Lady Caroline visited her child at Mrs.
Porter’s house as frequently as she was able. But
Julia seldom failed to call there every alternate
day; and thus the rearing of the poor infant
was strictly watched by its mother, and that
mother’s bosom friend. Sometimes Harry accompanied
his sister in her walk to Mrs. Porter’s cottage;
but the little fellow was always made to wait in
one room while Julia was shown the baby in another&mdash;and
thus the real motive of her visits there
was unsuspected by him. Not that she feared he
would reveal any thing which he was enjoined to
keep secret; but Julia believed&mdash;and rightly believed&mdash;that
it was alike more prudent and delicate
to leave him in total ignorance of the object which
took her to the cottage. Thus time wore on, as I
have already mentioned; and now I must remark
that in compliance with the wishes of Lord Wilmington,
Julia had by this time altogether ceased
to receive work; but instead of drawing on the
funds placed at her disposal in the hands of Mr.
Richardson, she subsisted upon the savings which
she had been enabled to accumulate. I mention all
these little circumstances, to afford you as good an
idea as I can convey of the excellence of her disposition,
and the total absence of selfishness from her
character. In fact, the more the marquis saw of
her, the more enamoured of her did he become, and
the greater grew his admiration of her amiable
qualities. It was therefore with joy the most unfeigned
that he at length considered himself justified
in fixing the day for the bridal; and this ceremony
was settled to take place precisely on the completion
of the six months from the hour in which he had
offered her his hand.</p>

<p>“While Julia was occupied in preparing her own
wedding-dress, the Marquis busied himself in rendering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
his splendid mansion in Belgrave Square as suitable
as possible for the reception of his bride. In the
meantime he had communicated to the Dowager-Marchioness
his intended marriage; but, as he had
feared, his design experienced the most decided disapproval
on her part. Vainly did he reason with her
on the subject&mdash;uselessly did he represent that his
happiness was seriously involved: his mother refused
to listen to him;&mdash;and he had the mortification to incur
her most serious displeasure. The bitterness of
her hostility to the match he however concealed from
Julia; and, much as he deplored the breach which
now existed between himself and his only surviving
parent, not for a moment did he entertain the thought
of yielding to her tyranny. Thus the time passed on;
and it was now within three days of the one fixed for
the bridal ceremony, when an incident occurred which
produced a terrible change in the aspect of affairs.</p>

<div id="i_137" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“It was a fine summer morning, and the clock was
striking eight just as Julia and little Harry were
sitting down to breakfast, when the old housekeeper
entered to inform her mistress that a woman by the
name of Porter desired to speak to her without delay;&mdash;for
you most remember that the housekeeper was
entirely ignorant of the transaction which so nearly
concerned Lady Caroline Jerningham, and to some
extent involved Miss Murray, at least as an accessory,
in the mysterious business. Mrs. Porter was instantly
admitted into the parlour; and when she appeared,
and the housekeeper had retired, Julia approached her
in an agitated manner and with an enquiring look,&mdash;for
it struck her that this visit&mdash;the first which the
woman had ever paid to the house since that night
when the infant was entrusted to her&mdash;augured something
unpleasant. In her excitement she forgot the
presence of her brother Harry&mdash;whom the woman herself
likewise overlooked; and, to the anxious glance
darted upon her, Mrs. Porter verbally replied by exclaiming,
‘Oh! Miss, the dear child has been suddenly
taken dangerously ill!’&mdash;‘The child dangerously ill!’
repeated Julia, who had learnt to love the infant almost
as much as if it were her own: ‘I will accompany
you directly;’ and, hurrying from the room, she
presently reappeared with her bonnet and shawl.
Then, noticing Harry, it flashed to her mind that he
had overheard what had been said: but a second
thought told her that more harm would be done by
attempting to explain away any impression that might
have been made upon his mind, than by leaving the
matter as it then stood;&mdash;and, having merely observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to him that she should return shortly, Julia hastened
away in company with Mrs. Porter. Harry finished
his breakfast, not thinking much of the few words
which had caught his ears, but which he could not
rightly understand; and, as it was holiday-time, he
was about to repair to play in the garden at the back
of the house, when a double knock at the front door
made him hasten to the window. Perceiving that the
visitor was the Marquis, he ran to give him admittance;
and the nobleman entered the parlour. ‘Where
is your sister, Harry?’ he asked, caressing the boy in
a kind manner.&mdash;‘She is gone out, my lord,’ was the
reply.&mdash;‘This early!’ exclaimed the Marquis; ‘and I
had promised myself the pleasure of breakfasting with
you both. The morning was so fine, and as I am a
very early riser, I rode out as far as the turnpike, and
have sent my horse back with the groom.’&mdash;The nobleman
spoke this rather in a musing tone, than actually
addressing himself to the boy; and, after a pause, he
observed, ‘I suppose your sister will not be long?’&mdash;‘I
do not know, my lord,’ answered Harry. ‘A
woman came just as we were sitting down to breakfast,
and Julia seemed much vexed at what she told
her.’&mdash;‘I hope that nothing disagreeable has occurred?’
cried the Marquis, in a tone of alarm.&mdash;‘The woman,
whose name is Porter, informed Julia that the child
was dangerously ill,’ responded Harry; ‘and then they
went away together.’&mdash;‘Oh! I understand,’ said the
Marquis: ‘the child of some poor woman named Porter
is unwell, and your sister has gone to see it.’&mdash;‘No,
my lord, I don’t think the child is Mrs. Porter’s,’ returned
Harry, ingenuously, and with boyish communicativeness;
’for I have often called at her cottage with
Julia, and I have heard Mr. Porter say that his wife’s
own baby died last winter.’&mdash;‘And Julia has often
called there?’ exclaimed the Marquis, a horrible suspicion
suddenly arising in his mind.&mdash;‘Very often
indeed,’ answered Harry, totally unconscious of the
tremendous amount of mischief he was occasioning.
‘When we have been out walking together, we have
come round that way, and stopped at the cottage; and
then I have waited in the kitchen with Mr. Porter,
who used to give me cakes or marbles, while Julia
went up stairs with Mrs. Porter.’&mdash;‘And did you ever
see the child?’ asked the nobleman, assuming as much
composure as he could possibly call to his aid.&mdash;‘No;
Julia never told me a word about it.’&mdash;‘And how did
you first hear of it?’&mdash;‘Just now, when Mrs. Porter
rushed in and said that the child was ill’&mdash;‘And was
Julia very, very sorry?’ demanded the Marquis.&mdash;‘Oh!
yes, indeed!’ cried the boy, who saw nothing
strange nor unusual in the nobleman’s tone or manner,
and regarded this dialogue as mere chit-chat.&mdash;‘And
whereabout is Mrs. Porter’s cottage?’ asked Wilmington,
in whose bosom a perfect hell was now raging.&mdash;‘Shall
I show your lordship the way?’ said Harry.
The nobleman nodded his head affirmatively; and the
little fellow hastened to fetch his cap. They then
proceeded in silence until they came within sight of
the cottage, which Harry pointed out.&mdash;‘You may
now go home again,’ said the Marquis; and Harry
obeyed the hint, still totally unsuspicious of the harm
which his candid garrulity had accomplished.</p>

<p>“The nobleman, when thus left alone, could no
longer restrain the emotions which agitated within
him. Turning aside from the path leading towards the
cottage, he rushed into the fields, exclaiming aloud,
‘Just heavens! on what an abyss was I hovering!
But can such diabolical perfidy exist on the part of
one so young? Oh! yes&mdash;it is too apparent; and my
mother was right when she counselled me never to
bestow my hand on a woman moving in a sphere beneath
my own!’&mdash;Having thus given vent to his
excited feelings, Wilmington grew more composed;
and he now approached the cottage. The door stood
open; and, entering without any ceremony, he saw a
woman at the same instant descend from a staircase.
‘Is your name Porter?’ he enquired, speaking in as
mild a tone as possible.&mdash;‘Yes, sir,’ she answered.&mdash;‘And
it is here that a child who has been, as it were,
abandoned by its unnatural mother, is lying dangerously
ill?’ he said, fixing his eyes keenly upon the
woman’s countenance.&mdash;‘Thank God, the dear innocent
is better!’ exclaimed Mrs. Porter, taken completely
off her guard, and even entertaining a suspicion
that the gentleman himself might be the father of her
nursling.&mdash;‘Now, confess every thing,’ cried the Marquis,
’or it will be the worse for you! Was it not
Miss Murray who engaged your services&mdash;&mdash;’.&mdash;‘No,
sir: it was the surgeon who attended the lady in her
confinement,’ interrupted Mrs. Porter, terrified by the
stern tone which her querist had suddenly adopted;
’but it was at Miss Murray’s house&mdash;&mdash;’.&mdash;‘Enough!
enough!’ ejaculated. Wilmington; and he hurried away
from the cottage.</p>

<p>“In the meantime Julia had returned home, having
assured herself that the child was out of danger;
and as she retraced her way by means of a bye-path,
it happened that she did not encounter her brother
and the marquis. But little Harry was light of foot;
and he, having been dismissed by the nobleman in
the way above stated, reached the front door at the
same instant as his sister. She was surprised to
find that he had been out&mdash;still more so when she
learnt that Lord Wilmington had called so early.
But a frightful sensation seized upon her, when Harry
ingenuously observed that the nobleman had taken
him to lead the way to the cottage. Subduing her
emotions, however, as well as she could, she proceeded
to question her brother; and in a short time she ascertained
all that had passed between him and the
Marquis. Each answer that he gave&mdash;each detail
that he mentioned, increased the horrible fears which
now oppressed her; and, at last&mdash;comprehending the
full extent of her misfortune,&mdash;perceiving the nature
of the suspicions which were sure to have seized upon
her intended husband,&mdash;she uttered a piercing cry,
pressed her hands in anguish to her throbbing brow,
and exclaimed in a piercing tone, ‘Oh! Harry, Harry,
you know not what you have done!’&mdash;The boy was
frightened; and, darting towards his sister, he threw
his arms around her neck, imploring her to forgive
him if he had acted improperly. Even in the midst
of her bitter, bitter anguish, she could not find it in
her heart to continue angry with her little brother,
who had not wantonly nor wickedly inflicted this
appalling injury upon her; and, assuming an appearance
of calmness, she became the consoler. In the
depth of misery there is a crisis that makes even despair
the immediate precursor of hope; and Julia
began to reason to herself that all might not be so
dark as she had feared. But while she was thus endeavouring
to persuade her inmost soul to render
itself accessible to consolation, a note was put into
her hand by the housekeeper. She glanced at the
address which was hurriedly&mdash;almost illegibly written,
and the ink of which was scarcely dry,&mdash;so that
she knew it had been penned somewhere in the
neighbourhood. With trembling hands she tore it
open; and her strength and mental energy sustained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
her sufficiently to permit the entire perusal of the
letter. Its contents ran thus:&mdash;‘<em>I have discovered
your frailty, your guilt, your hypocrisy, just in time
to save myself from an alliance which would have
brought dishonour on my name, and heaped endless
miseries on my head. I shall not attempt to reproach
you at any length for your conduct towards me: my
generous confidence has been met by the blackest duplicity&mdash;the
most diabolical ingratitude; and your conscience
will punish you more&mdash;oh! far more severely
than any words that I may address to you. Neither
shall I adopt the mean and petty revenge of exposing
you: but if you ever dare to boast that you were once
engaged to be married to the Marquis of Wilmington,
then shall I consider that it would be a sin to
spare you.</em>’</p>

<p>“The letter dropped from Julia’s hand; and, with
a wild shriek, she fell senseless on the floor. The
housekeeper administered restoratives, while little
Harry, who was himself a prey to the liveliest grief
he had ever yet known, hurried to fetch the surgeon.
It was the same medical man who had attended upon
Lady Caroline Jerningham; and he was prompt in
repairing to a house where his former services had
been so liberally rewarded. Julia had somewhat recovered
in the meantime; but he pronounced her to
be in a dangerous state&mdash;and, indeed, she seemed
quite unconscious of every thing that was passing
around her. She was conveyed to her chamber,&mdash;medicine
was prescribed,&mdash;and the surgeon recommended
the housekeeper not to leave her mistress
alone more than was absolutely necessary, inasmuch
as he feared that her brain was affected. Little Harry
was inconsolable at his sister’s illness&mdash;the more especially
that he reproached himself with having been
the cause of it all; though how he had done the
harm he could not by any means understand. Seated
by Julia’s bed-side, he fixed his tearful eyes on her
pale countenance, as she slumbered uneasily; and
when hours had passed, and evening came, and still
she awoke not, he was afraid that she was dead. The
housekeeper, however, assured him to the contrary;
and then he bent softly over his sister, to whom the
surgeon had administered an opiate, and gently kissed
her lips. She murmured a name&mdash;it was his own name&mdash;and
opened her eyes. Complete consciousness returned
in a few minutes; and as she rapidly surveyed
her misfortune and calculated its extent, she shuddered
at the idea of even attempting to meet it with
resignation. But for that little brother’s sake&mdash;the
sake of him whom she had found bending over her,
and whose name was the first that her lips breathed
on her waking,&mdash;for <em>his</em> sake she nerved herself to
wage war with the world once more. Though a word
of explanation&mdash;the mere revelation of Lady Caroline’s
secret would at once restore her to that position
so full of hope which she had occupied in the morning,&mdash;still
her generous heart would not allow her to
betray her friend. No: she would sooner pine away
and go down to an early grave, heart-broken and
spirit-crushed, than proclaim to the Marquis the secret
of his noble sister’s dishonour!</p>

<p>“It was about seven o’clock in the evening of this
dreadful day that a hasty and impatient double-knock
at the front door was heard; and a few moments afterwards
Lady Caroline Jerningham was ushered into
the chamber where Julia was lying. The moment she
entered, the patient made a signal for the housekeeper
and little Harry to withdraw; and when the two
friends were alone together, a most affecting scene took
place. It appeared that the marquis had that afternoon
written a letter to his sister, of which the following
were the enigmatical contents:&mdash;‘<em>I am almost
heart-broken, my dearest Caroline, and cannot see
you at present. I shall retire into the country for a
few weeks&mdash;perhaps months&mdash;to hide my grief from
every eye, and endeavour to regain somewhat of that
mental composure which has been almost completely
wrecked this day. Julia is unworthy of my love and
of your friendship: what the proof of this may be,
ask not&mdash;seek not to learn;&mdash;but I charge you to visit
her no more. Your afflicted brother</em>,’ &amp;c.&mdash;On the
receipt of this note, Lady Caroline, who could not help
suspecting that this suddenly wrought change in the
sentiments of the Marquis arose from some fearful
misunderstanding or some partial discovery respecting
the child, had hastened, almost distracted and a
prey to intolerable suspense, to Julia’s abode; and there
she was shocked to find her generous-hearted friend
stretched upon a bed of sickness. Embracing each
other affectionately, they gave mutual explanations;
and Lady Caroline perceived that her worst fears were
confirmed. The Marquis had indeed made a discovery
relative to the infant; but he was deceived with regard
to its maternity. And now who can describe the
admiration which Lady Caroline experienced for the
character of her friend, when she learnt that the poor
girl would rather lie under the dread suspicion of the
Marquis&mdash;rather resign all her brilliant prospects, and
see her heart’s fondest affections blighted,&mdash;rather, in
fact, resign herself to immolation than betray her
whose secret she deemed so sacred!</p>

<p>“‘No&mdash;no!’ exclaimed the fair patrician, throwing
herself upon Julia’s bosom, and weeping plenteously;
’this may not be! Never can I permit you, noble-hearted
girl, to endure infamy, reproach, and wretchedness
for my sake! I will at once follow my brother
into the country, throw myself at his feet, confess all,
and bring him back to you!’&mdash;‘And then what will
become of <em>you</em>, Caroline?’ asked Julia, mingling her tears
with those of her friend.’&mdash;‘Oh! I shall retire from
the world, and bury myself, with my innocent babe,
in some solitude&mdash;in some far-off village, perhaps,
where, under a feigned name, I may escape the world’s
scorn for this fatal weakness which has caused so much
misery!’&mdash;and, as she spoke, Lady Caroline’s voice indicated
the most acute anguish of heart. ‘Unless,’
she added, her tone suddenly becoming hoarse and
hollow, and her manner unnaturally subdued,&mdash;‘unless,
indeed, my brother, in the first ebullition of his rage
should stretch me dead at his feet; and that is the
most probable result!’&mdash;‘Then, dearest Caroline,’ exclaimed
Julia, speaking in a tone of mingled alarm
and earnest entreaty, ‘for heaven’s sake renounce this
mad project! Do not think of seeking your brother
and thus exposing yourself to his rage. I owe you a
deep, deep debt of gratitude; and now let me pay it
by enduring that weight of suspicion against which I
may haply bear up, but which would crush and overwhelm
you. For never, never can I forget that when
I appeared, full of terror and trembling, with the spoilt
dress in your mother’s presence, your looks gave me
encouragement, and your kind words reassured me.
Then, when I was leaving your dwelling without the
means of even procuring a loaf for my dear little
brother and myself, you put gold into my hand. Oh!
dear lady, these are manifestations of generosity which
never can be forgotten; and, noble as you are by name,
you are nobler in heart. It will be my joy&mdash;my pride
to screen <em>you</em>, who have proved so kind a friend to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
me; and there is no sacrifice that I am unprepared to
make in order to save you from unhappiness and
shame!’&mdash;‘It is an angel that speaks!’ murmured
Lady Caroline, overpowered by this generosity on the
part of Julia Murray. ‘But nothing, nothing,’ she
continued, with reviving energy, and after a few moments’
pause, ‘shall induce me to yield to your desire.
I recognise all that is great and noble in your conduct;
and so long as I remain possessed of intellect and
memory, I shall pray night and morning for the
Almighty to bless you, my dearest Julia. I have been
frail, and I must bear the consequences. Seek not to
wean me from this intention: I should never know a
happy moment, were I to permit <em>you</em> to become the
victim of <em>my</em> shame!’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>&mdash;‘One word!’ exclaimed Miss
Murray, after a minute’s profound reflection: ‘I will
no longer urge you to act contrary to your heart’s
dictates; but promise me that you will not take a
single step towards revealing every thing to your
brother and exculpating me, until four-and-twenty
hours shall have elapsed. During that interval we
shall both have time for serious and calm meditation;
and no advantage will result from precipitate haste.’&mdash;‘Yes;
I make you this promise, Julia,’ returned Lady
Caroline; ‘on the condition that when we meet again
to-morrow evening, it shall not be to argue whether I
am to confess or not, but in what manner the confession
can be most suitably and safely made.’&mdash;‘Agreed!’
cried Miss Murray: ‘and to-morrow evening, at seven
o’clock, you will visit me again?’&mdash;‘I will,’ answered
Lady Caroline Jerningham; and she then took her
leave of her friend, whom she embraced with the
warmth of the most sincere affection.</p>

<p>“On the following day, at about three o’clock in the
afternoon, a letter, addressed to Lady Caroline Jerningham,
was delivered at the mansion in Hanover
Square by a porter, who hurried away the moment he
had placed it in the servant’s hands. The contents of
this note ran as follow:&mdash;‘<em>Dearest Caroline, it is useless
for you to call this evening at the house which I
have occupied for so many months, and which was
purchased by your excellent brother’s money. I shall
no longer be the occupant of that house, when this note
reaches you. My mind is made up to endure every
thing for your sake; and I therefore this day withdraw
myself, in company with Harry, into a retirement
and an obscurity whither you cannot follow me.
It will therefore be unnecessary and ridiculous&mdash;I may
almost say</em> wicked&mdash;<em>for you to make any revelations
to your brother. By sacrificing yourself, you would
confer no benefit upon me; as nothing shall induce
me to alter the plans I have formed respecting the
future. Retain profoundly secret all those circumstances
the confession of which can have no useful
result; and think sometimes of me&mdash;for I shall often,
often think of you, my well-beloved friend,&mdash;although
we may never, never meet again!</em>’&mdash;This letter, on
which were the traces of weeping, produced a stupefying
sensation on the part of Lady Caroline. Was it
possible that Julia, in the zeal of her ardent friendship,
had outwitted the fair patrician, and had won
the generous game at which they were playing? No
wonder that Miss Murray had requested Caroline to
suspend all proceedings for twenty-four hours: in that
time, the noble-hearted girl had consummated the
sacrifice of herself! And now nothing could exceed
the sincerity and the depth of that grief which seized
upon the lady: for an hour after she received the note,
she was as one demented; and her confidential maid
experienced the utmost difficulty in restraining her
from manifestations of feeling which would have excited
the strangest suspicions in the household. At
length, when she had grown comparatively calm, Lady
Caroline, attended by her maid, repaired to Camden
Town; but there they only beheld those appearances
which corroborated the statements contained in Julia’s
letter. For the house was shut up; and, on enquiry
being made of a neighbour, it was ascertained that
Miss Murray, her servant, and her little brother had
taken their departure soon after mid-day, although,
according to the same authority, the young milliner
was evidently suffering from indisposition. The fair
patrician’s last hope of seeing her friend and weaning
her from her intention, was thus destroyed; and the
poignancy of her grief was renewed. She proceeded
to Mrs. Porter’s cottage, where she learnt that Julia
had called in the morning to assure herself of the
child’s convalescence and imprint upon its little countenance
a farewell kiss. This touching instance of
Julia’s goodness of heart moved Lady Caroline to
tears; and she reproached herself bitterly for having
been the cause of all her friend’s present sorrows.</p>

<p>“There, however, appeared to be a remedy which
might yet be adopted; and to this measure did the
lady make up her mind. She resolved, in fact, to
write to her brother without delay, inform him of
every thing, and urge him to lose no time in discovering
the retreat of Julia, that justice&mdash;full and ample
justice&mdash;might be done to her. Accordingly, on the
following morning she penned a long letter to the Marquis
of Wilmington, imploring him to forgive her for
the dishonour she had brought upon the family, and
drawing such a picture of Julia’s generosity in sacrificing
herself for a friend, that she wept long and plentifully
over the pages as she perused them. When
this epistle had been despatched to the post, Caroline’s
heart felt easier; and she said to herself, ‘Even if my
brother should wreak the bitterest vengeance upon me,
I can endure his resentment with resignation; for I
now have the consciousness of performing a sacred and
solemn duty.’&mdash;The Dowager-Marchioness, in the
meantime, had been suffering through indisposition
which confined her much to her chamber; and she did
not therefore perceive any particular variations in the
manner and aspect of her daughter.</p>

<span class="medium">CONCLUSION OF THE HISTORY OF THE DRESS-MAKER:
A LOVE STORY.</span></h2>

<p>“Two days after Lady Caroline Jerningham’s letter
had been sent, the Marquis of Wilmington arrived in
London; and, hastening to Hanover Square, he obtained
an immediate interview with his sister. Pale,
trembling, and unable to endure his glance, she
awaited in torturing suspense the first words that
should issue from his lips; and never was relief from
agonising feelings more welcome or more complete,
than when the Marquis, taking his sister’s hand, said
in a gentle though mournful voice, ‘Caroline, I am
not come to reproach you&mdash;much less to add to your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
afflictions by the heartless cruelty and absurd inutility
of an exposure. No: I give you all my sympathy;
and I thank you most sincerely for having confessed
every thing, that you might restore your friend to my
favour.’&mdash;Lady Caroline threw herself into her brother’s
arms, and wept upon his breast; but when the emotions
attendant upon this meeting had somewhat subsided,
the Marquis said, ‘Heaven be thanked that
Julia is innocent! Deeply, deeply as I deplore the
sad circumstances involved in your revelation, Caroline,
yet it is a relief to know that she&mdash;that poor,
suffering, wrongly suspected girl&mdash;is worthy of all my
love! And if I before loved her&mdash;if I before esteemed
and admired her as the pattern of every thing great
and noble, generous and amiable in Woman,&mdash;Oh!
now what strength have those sentiments acquired!
No time must be lost in finding her out; and this moment
shall I enter upon the search.’&mdash;The Marquis
then took a hasty leave of his sister, and in the first
instance repaired to Mr. Richardson to consult him
upon the subject. Without in any way compromising
his sister, the Marquis related enough to let the worthy
lawyer know that Julia had been unjustly suspected&mdash;that
her innocence was completely established, and that
he now longed to find out her retreat, with the view to
make her the fullest possible reparation. Mr. Richardson
then stated that three days previously a porter had
called on him, bringing the key of the house at Camden
Town, with an intimation that Miss Murray surrendered
up the tenement to its proprietor, with all the
furniture it contained,&mdash;in fact, in the same condition
as when the property was made over to her. A tear
stole into the eye of the Marquis, as he received this
proof of Julia’s strict integrity; and Mr. Richardson
advised that an advertisement, drawn up in a manner
calculated to strike Miss Murray’s comprehension, but
ambiguous to the public generally, should be kept
standing in the <cite>Times</cite> and other widely circulated
newspapers until her retreat should have been discovered.
The Marquis approved of this plan; and,
leaving his solicitor to execute it, he departed from
the office to pursue his search elsewhere. He now
proceeded to Camden Town, and (having the key with
him) entered the house; but delicacy forbade him to
penetrate into any other rooms save the parlours;
and there he found not a letter nor a scrap of paper
that might afford any clue to the place whither Julia
had retired. His heart was heavy&mdash;his grief was
profound; and frequent sighs rent his manly breast as
he repaired to the cottage where the child&mdash;his sister’s
child&mdash;dwelt under the care of Mrs. Porter. His
strange manner on his previous visit did not obtain
for him a very welcome reception at the hands of that
female; but when she found that he spoke kindly and
inquired anxiously concerning the infant, her reserve
began to dissipate, and she at last thought him a very
agreeable gentleman. The child was brought to him,
and he kissed it affectionately. An allusion which
Mrs. Porter happened to make to Miss Murray, enabled
the Marquis to turn the conversation upon that loved
being who seemed lost to him; and now he heard the
warmest and sincerest praises uttered in regard to her;
but not a syllable affording a trace of her present
abode. In fact, it was very evident that Mrs. Porter
was as ignorant as himself in that respect; and still
was it with a heavy heart that the nobleman turned
away to prosecute his search elsewhere.</p>

<p>“He had learnt from his sister that Julia, her little
brother, and the old housekeeper had taken their
departure together in a hackney-coach; and he concluded
that the vehicle was hired from some stand in
the neighbourhood. Behold, then, this rich and well-born
peer visiting all the stations of cabs and coaches
in the vicinity, and pursuing his enquiries amongst a
class of men whom his liberality alone succeeded in
divesting of their habitual insolence. But still all his
endeavours to solve the painful mystery were fruitless;
and, after a weary day’s researches, he returned home,
exhausted in physical energy and worn down by
mental depression, to his magnificent house in Belgrave
Square. His reliance was now in the advertisements
which were to be inserted in the newspapers;
but even this hope was almost stifled within him by
the reminiscence that Julia seldom read the public
journals. Day after day passed&mdash;weeks glided by&mdash;these
had swollen into months in the lapse of time&mdash;and
winter returned;&mdash;but still no trace of Julia! In
the interval, matters of importance had occurred in
respect to Lady Caroline Jerningham. The child had
died in a fit of convulsions, to which it was subject,
and in spite of the tender care of Mrs. Porter and
the attentions of the medical man: the remains of
the infant were interred in the churchyard of Old
Saint Pancras; and the Porters, who were well rewarded
for their kindness to the child from the
moment of its birth until that of its death, still
remain in ignorance of the real name and the rank
of its mother. Not many weeks after the removal
from this earthly sphere of the evidence of Lady
Caroline’s frailty, Lord Hartley returned home from
abroad; and his first act, on arriving in London, was
to hasten to Hanover Square. His heart had remained
constant to Lady Caroline; and he now boldly claimed
her hand of the Marchioness, who received him most
graciously, there being, in the Dowager’s eyes, a vast
deal of difference between the noble and wealthy
Baron Hartley of Hartley, and the poor Lieutenant
Quentin of His Majesty’s Ship <em>The Tremendous</em>. The
<cite>Morning Post</cite> accordingly announced the ‘approaching
marriage in high life;’ and the ceremony took
place in November, 1835,&mdash;precisely one year after
the date of the commencement of our tale.</p>

<p>“Thus Lady Caroline Jerningham became Lady
Hartley: she was united to the object of her affection;&mdash;but
her happiness was not complete. Every day&mdash;every
hour did she think of poor Julia Murray; and
her husband, to whom she had confided every thing,
shared in her deep anxiety to obtain a clue to that
excellent young woman. The Marquis of Wilmington
had put into execution every means which human
ingenuity could devise to procure that clue: but all
to no effect; and he now gave himself up to despair.
His health began to fail him; and his appearance
speedily grew much altered. Vainly did his sister
endeavour to console him: she also required solace,
and almost in respect to the same cause,&mdash;for if the
one mourned the loss of an intended bride, the other
deplored that of a dear friend!</p>

<p>“I said that the incident of my tale had brought
me down to the month of November, 1835; and it
now becomes necessary to make some mention of Julia
Murray. It was a night of pouring rain and gushing
wind, as on that when she first encountered the Marquis
of Wilmington; and the unhappy young woman
was seated in a miserable garret in some street near
Covent Garden Market. The cheerless chamber was
almost completely denuded of furniture; and the little
that was in it, belonged not to her. Not a spark of
fire appeared in the hearth;&mdash;the cupboard door was
opened, but no food was seen on the shelves;&mdash;and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
candle that shed a fitful light around the bare, damp
walls, was every moment in danger of being extinguished
by the cold draught from the ill-closed
window. Leaning her head upon her hand, and her
elbow on the table, Julia sate, gazing down on the
upturned countenance of her brother who occupied a
stool at her feet. Pale and wan were their faces:
gone was the bloom of health from the cheeks of the
once happy, beauteous boy,&mdash;gone, too, was the delicate
tinge of carnation that had been wont to enhance
the loveliness of his sister. Misery was in that garret&mdash;misery
for <em>two</em>&mdash;misery for that almost heart-broken
young woman and that affectionate, grateful boy.
The want of needle-work and illness had plunged
Julia into the direst poverty: she could have borne it
all had she been by herself&mdash;borne it almost without
repining;&mdash;but when she looked on the pale face of
her little brother, saw that he was famishing for want,
and knew also that he endeavoured to conceal his
hunger from her for fear of increasing <em>her</em> grief,&mdash;oh!
it was this&mdash;it was <em>this</em> that crushed and overwhelmed
her! She glanced around: there was not an article of
clothing that could be now spared to pledge, save her
scanty shawl&mdash;and then how could she go abroad to
ask for needlework without it? Heavens! twelve
hours had the boy already fasted&mdash;twenty-four hours
had elapsed since Julia had tasted a morsel of food;&mdash;for
she had almost forced the last crust into his mouth!
And now how many hours more must elapse ere a
chance might present itself to afford them a meal?
And if no work could be obtained, what were they to
do? What, indeed!</p>

<p>“In the midst of all these bitter&mdash;harrowing reflections,
a thought&mdash;or rather a reminiscence flashed
to Julia’s mind;&mdash;but it was only to plunge her more
deeply into the abyss of woe, and not to solace her.
Just one year had elapsed since she had first met the
Marquis of Wilmington,&mdash;just one year, day for day:
and through how many vicissitudes had she and her
darling brother passed in that period! They had
known prosperity and happiness: they had also experienced
the bitterest misery, and yet they had not
deserved the vengeance of heaven: but, then, those
whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth! Still pure and
guileless&mdash;still innocent and artless, Julia Murray’s
principles had remained unshaken by the rude contest
which she had been compelled to endure with
the world’s ills; and her brother was still the same
affectionate, good, endearing boy as when I first introduced
you to him. Oh! it was cruel&mdash;it was cruel
that <em>they</em> should suffer thus&mdash;those poor orphans who
had never injured a living soul, who clung to each
other so tenderly, and who night and morning put up
their prayers to the Almighty that He would be
pleased to change their wretched, wretched lot. But,
alas! those supplications&mdash;so sincere, so earnest, so
respectful and adoring towards the Majesty of Heaven&mdash;remained
apparently unheard; and on the particular
night to which allusion has been made, do we
find that sister and brother on the verge of perishing
through sheer destitution!</p>

<p>“‘Harry,’ said Julia, after a long pause, ‘are you not
very hungry?’&mdash;‘Not very, dear sister,’ he returned,
while tears started into his eyes.&mdash;‘Oh! my darling
boy, you are starving!’ she cried frantically, as she
strained him to her breast: then, growing more composed,
she said, ‘But this must not be! Here, Harry,
take this shawl over to that shop which you see opposite,
give it to any one whom you may see behind
the counter, and you will receive some money and a
small card in exchange. Then go to the baker’s and
buy a loaf; and return as quickly as you can.’&mdash;The
boy hesitated; and at length said, ‘But, Julia dear,
what will you do without your shawl? You cannot
go out.’&mdash;‘And you cannot starve,’ she returned
hastily; as she almost thrust him, but not harshly,
out of the room. Then, when the door closed behind
him, she reseated herself, and burst into an agony of
tears. It was the first time she had ever sent Harry
to the pawnbroker&mdash;the first time she had ever allowed
him to go out into the streets alone after dusk.
And this was not all that pained her: Oh! she was
oppressed with the most direful apprehensions&mdash;for
now she was indeed a prisoner in that wretched garret&mdash;she
could not go out to seek for work, and work
would not be brought to her. And again, and again,
and again&mdash;for the thousandth time that day&mdash;did she
ask herself what was to be done, and what was to become
of them? While she was wrapt up in these
harrowing reflections, she heard certain well-known&mdash;too
well-known steps ascending the stairs; and now
she felt that even the crushing amount of misery
which already weighed upon her, was not complete.
The door was thrown open; and a stout, elderly, red-faced
woman, who had evidently been drinking,
walked unceremoniously into the chamber. ‘Now,
Miss,’ she cried, almost ferociously, ‘are you going to
pay me the three weeks’ rent that’s due? If not, be
so kind as to tramp, and make room for them as will
pay; ‘cos I’ve a respectable married couple which is
ready to take the place this very night.’&mdash;‘If you will
wait a few minutes,’ answered Julia, in a faint tone, ‘I
will pay you as much as I can.’&mdash;‘Come, that won’t
do for me,’ vociferated the woman: ‘I see your
brother go out with your shawl, and I know what’s
what. But if you’re obliged to spout your things to
pay a trifle this week, how will you be able to pay
any at all next Saturday, much less cash up altogether?’&mdash;‘Heavens!
have patience, my dear madam,
and I will endeavour to pay you all, as soon as possible!’
said the poor young woman, reduced to despair.&mdash;‘Patience,
indeed!’ repeated the landlady,
contemptuously: ‘and who will have patience with
me? There is the Taxes will call on Monday morning;
and the Water Rate has been put off till he’s
tired of coming near the place. So I can’t and won’t
wait no longer for such a beggar as you.’&mdash;At
this goading insolence Julia’s grief redoubled.&mdash;‘Oh!
crying won’t pay no bills,’ ejaculated the inhuman
landlady. ‘And now I think on it, I’ll just look at
the bed-clothes and see that you haven’t pawned
none of the blankets!’&mdash;‘I would sooner starve&mdash;aye,
and see my brother perish through want also, than
commit such an act!’ cried Julia, starting to her feet,
while her indignation actually tended to mitigate the
acuteness of her grief. ‘Well, I ’spose you’re honest,’
said the woman, somewhat ashamed of herself: ‘but
I must have my money to-night all the same; if not,
you and your brother had better turn out at once.’&mdash;‘I
repeat that it is impossible for me to pay you all
I owe this evening,’ exclaimed poor Julia, now condescending
to the adoption of a tone of appeal; ‘and I
implore you not to drive me and that dear boy homeless
into the streets.’&mdash;‘A pretty gal like you need
never want money,’ said the woman, fixing a meaning
look upon the unhappy dress-maker; ‘and if you
would only take my advice&mdash;&mdash;.’&mdash;‘Begone,’ cried
Julia in a voice so penetrating that it seemed to thrill
through the brain of the vile wretch who was about
to develope the most infamous resources to the view of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
that pure-minded girl&mdash;‘Begone, indeed!’ repeated
the woman, recovering her insolence: ‘that’s a pretty
thing to say to me, that you owe money to. However,
once more I tell you that I <em>will</em> be paid to-night; or
else, when my husband comes home from the public-house,
off you’ll bundle!’&mdash;Thus speaking, the wretch
bounced out of the room, leaving the door wide open
behind her.</p>

<p>“Julia wrung her hands in despair; and again she
asked herself those unanswerable questions&mdash;What
would become of them? and what was to be done?
At this moment, when her brain appeared to reel and
reason was rocking on its throne, the sounds of hasty
steps ascending the stairs met her ear, and she heard
Harry’s voice exclaim, ‘Up higher still&mdash;to the very
top!’ And up those hasty footsteps came:&mdash;good
heavens! were fresh miseries in store for her? But
scarcely had this thought traversed poor Julia’s imagination,
when some one darted into the room&mdash;and
as she was sinking on the floor, through terror, want,
and exhaustion, she was received in the arms of the
Marquis of Wilmington!&mdash;‘Julia, dearest Julia!’ he
cried, in an impassioned tone, as he strained the insensible
form of his beloved one to his breast: and
that voice, sounding on her ear as if heard in the midst
of a dream, recalled her to herself;&mdash;and opening her
eyes slowly, she encountered the tender looks that
were bent upon her.&mdash;‘Is it possible!’ she exclaimed,
tearing herself from the nobleman’s embrace: ‘your
lordship here?’&mdash;‘Yes: here to implore your pardon
for the past; to declare to you how profound is the regret
and how bitter the remorse I have experienced
for the unfeeling haste with which I judged you on
the barest suspicion; and to offer you my hand, Julia,’
added the Marquis, ‘if you will now condescend to
accept it!’&mdash;But I need not pause to describe in detail
the discourse which now ensued: suffice it to say
that the nobleman gave the fullest explanation of all
that had occurred since he had last seen Julia&mdash;how
his sister had confessed her frailty, and thus cleared up
the suspicion which had so unfortunately fallen upon Julia&mdash;how
the child had died&mdash;how Lady Caroline
had married Lord Hartley&mdash;and how every possible
search had been made for so many long, weary months,
after Miss Murray. It must be added that the Marquis,
in his almost ceaseless wanderings about the
metropolis in the prosecution of that search, happened
on this memorable evening to pass through the very
neighbourhood where Julia resided; and as Harry
emerged from the pawnbroker’s shop, the light flashed
full upon the little fellow’s countenance, which, in
spite of its altered appearance, was immediately recognised
by the Marquis.</p>

<p>“But little more remains to be told. A messenger
was instantly despatched to Hartley House with a note
from Lord Wilmington; and in less than an hour his
sister Caroline, accompanied by her faithful lady’s maid,
who had charge of a box full of clothes, arrived in her
carriage at the door of the house where Julia occupied
the miserable garret! Affecting indeed was the meeting
between the two friends; and while the Marquis
took Harry away with him to the nearest ready-made
clothes’ shop to equip the boy from head to foot in new
apparel, Lady Hartley hastily made such a change in
Julia’s appearance, by means of the contents of the box
before alluded to, that when his lordship returned he
was charmed to see that, though pale, she was still
eminently beautiful. In the meantime the rumour
had spread throughout the house how a great nobleman
and a great lady had come to take the poor dress-maker
away in their carriage; and now the vile woman
who only an hour before had menaced Julia with
ejectment&mdash;who had insulted her by offering to search
the few miserable things in the room to see if any had
been made away with&mdash;and who had hinted at an infamous
proposal from which the young creature’s soul
recoiled in horror and loathing,&mdash;that same detestable
wretch was now most assiduous in offering the use of
her parlour and rendering herself so officiously busy, that
Lady Hartley was forced to order her in a peremptory
manner to retire. In fine, all necessary preparations
being made so that Julia and her brother might appear
in a becoming way at the splendid mansion whither
they were now about to repair, the happy party entered
the carriage, which drove straight to Hartley House,
where Caroline’s husband received Julia and Harry in
the kindest possible manner.</p>

<p>“Thus was the aspect of affairs signally changed;
and from the cold, cheerless garret, where want stared
them in the face, were the sister and brother suddenly
wafted into the very bosom of luxury, comfort, and
happiness. Virtue met with its reward, after the
many trials to which it had been subjected, and
the numerous temptations it had triumphantly
passed through. Mr. Richardson, the lawyer, was
overjoyed when the Marquis called upon him next
morning and related all that had happened; and the
instant his lordship had taken his departure, the
worthy solicitor hastened to Hanover Square, resolved,
if possible, to accomplish a certain project which he
had in view. Presenting himself to the Dowager-Marchioness,
he argued with her upon the inutility
and injustice, the folly and the cruelty of her opposition
to an alliance which so nearly regarded her son’s
happiness; and he dilated so warmly upon the good
qualities of Julia Murray, that her ladyship, who had
at first heard him with impatience, began to listen attentively.
In a word, Mr. Richardson succeeded in
persuading the Marchioness to have the credit of
assenting to an union which she had not the power
to prevent; and the policy of this step at last
triumphed over her other repugnances. She accordingly
rang the bell, ordered the carriage, and proceeded
with the lawyer to Hartley House, where her
presence augmented the happiness already experienced
beneath that roof. Thus nothing was now wanting
to complete the felicity of all those in whom, I hope,
you are interested; and it was astonishing how speedily
the bloom came back to the countenance of Julia, and
the ruddy hues of health to the cheeks of little Harry.</p>

<p>“Six weeks after the discovery of the orphans in
their wretched garret, Julia became the Marchioness
of Wilmington. Happy&mdash;happy was that bridal, and
beautiful was the blushing bride&mdash;so beautiful that a
stranger would not have suspected the privations and
miseries which she had undergone. And, as if heaven,
in its justice, were determined to afford a signal proof
that though it can chasten, it can also reward as fully&mdash;from
the day that this union took place, Julia and her
brother have not known a care. Possessing the power
to do good, the Marchioness of Wilmington has been
enabled to soothe many an afflicted heart; and her
experience of the past has taught her that the severest
misery is that which pines unseen and hides itself in
garrets&mdash;not that which obtrudes itself, in the shape
of mendicity, upon the public eye. Her <em>secret charities</em>
are therefore boundless; and the elevation of such a
woman to rank and the possession of immense wealth,
has proved beneficial to thousands. I must not forget
to observe that the housekeeper who had accompanied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
her on her departure from Camden Town, and who
had subsequently returned home, at Julia’s request, to
her friends, once more became an attendant in the
household of the mistress whom she loved; and every
one who had in any way shown kindness to my
heroine when she was but the humble dress-maker,
was sought out and liberally rewarded, by her whose
heart had undergone no change although she had become
the Marchioness of Wilmington.”</p>

<span class="medium">DOVER.</span></h2>

<p>It must not be supposed that this long tale was related
without an interval of rest. When it broke off at the
end of the hundred and forty-second chapter, the travellers
were just on the point of entering Rochester, where
they lunched; and, after this brief halt, they pursued
their journey, Charles resuming the thread of his narrative,
to which Perdita listened with deep interest.</p>

<p>The young woman experienced an ineffable pleasure
in drinking in with her ears the rich tones of her
lover’s voice; and the pathetic nature of his story
increased the tenderness which she felt for him. She,
who had defied the influence of the blind deity, was
wounded by his shaft; and the more she saw of
Charles Hatfield, the less selfish became her passion&mdash;the
more sincere her attachment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhardinge read, with a keen eye, all that
was passing in her daughter’s mind; and there were
moments when she could scarcely restrain her rage at
the idea that Perdita had succeeded so skilfully in
throwing her into the back-ground. But the old
woman resolved to abide her time&mdash;in the hope that
circumstances might yet enable her to resume her
sway, and compel the enamoured couple to bend to the
dictates of her will.</p>

<p>The journey was pursued in safety, and in freedom
from any unpleasant interruption, until the post-chaise
entered the town of Dover. Then the travellers were
to pass the night; and thence they were to embark on
the ensuing morning for Calais.</p>

<p>They took up their quarters at an hotel, where an
excellent dinner was provided; and in the evening
Charles Hatfield and Perdita rambled together upon
the beach, Mrs. Fitzhardinge remaining at the inn on
the plea of fatigue, but in reality because her daughter
made her a private sign to intimate that her company
was not needed.</p>

<p>It was a summer evening of surpassing loveliness:
the sea was calm and tranquil in its mighty bed,
agitated only at its margin when wavelets, so small
that they might almost be denominated ripples, murmured
on the beach;&mdash;and the western horizon was
gorgeous with purple, and orange, and gold&mdash;the
swathing robes of the setting sun.</p>

<p>There were many ladies and gentlemen walking on
the Marine Parade, and enjoying the freshness of the
air after the oppressive heat of the sultry day. Amongst
the loungers, several officers belonging to the garrison
were conspicuous by their scarlet coats; and giddy,
silly young ladies of sixteen or seventeen felt themselves
supremely happy if they could only secure the
attentions of these military <em>beaux</em>.</p>

<p>Here and there were long seats, painted green, and
occupied by ladies, their male companions standing
in lounging attitudes; and the conversation that occupied
these groups was for the most part of a frivolous
nature,&mdash;for people at watering places only seek to
kill time, and not to use it for intellectual purposes.</p>

<p>On one of the benches just alluded to, was placed a
middle-aged mamma with her three marriageable
daughters, who were pretty, chatty, agreeable girls,
according to the general meaning of the epithets: at
all events, whenever Mrs. Matson appeared on the
Parade with the three Misses Matson, the officers
were sure to steal away from other groups or parties
in order to join the new-comers&mdash;to the immense gratification
of the objects of this preference, and to the
huge mortification of the Jones’s, the Smiths, the
Jenkins, the Greens, and the Browns.</p>

<p>“Were you at Lady Noakes’s last evening, Captain
Phinnikin?” enquired the eldest Miss Matson of a
gallant officer of some four or five and twenty, who
was lounging near her.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not I, faith!” was the reply given in a drawling
tone, as if the gallant officer aforesaid were a martyr
to that dreadful malady termed <em>ennui</em>. “Lady Noakes’s
parties are such slow affairs&mdash;I have quite abjured
them. Besides,” he added, suddenly recollecting that
this was an excellent opportunity to throw in a compliment,
“I knew <em>you</em> weren’t to be there.”</p>

<p>“Oh! dear, no!” exclaimed Miss Julia Matson&mdash;the
second of the marriageable sisters: “one does meet
such strange people at her ladyship’s, that we really
could not think of accepting the invitation.”</p>

<p>“Well, but you must recollect, my dear,” observed
Mrs. Matson, in a tone which seemed to be of mild
reproof, “that poor dear Lady Noakes is only the
widow of a brewer who was mayor of Deal or Sandwich,
I forget which, and was knighted by William
the Fourth for taking up some address to his Majesty.”</p>

<p>“That’s all!” said Miss Anna-Maria Matson, the
third sister: “and therefore I am sure no one need be
surprised that Lady Noakes is glad to fill her rooms
with any body she can get.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was there last night,” observed another
young officer&mdash;a lieutenant in the same regiment with
Captain Phinnikin, and who formed one of the group
at present occupying our attention: “and I must say
that the supper was excellent.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but, Mr. Pink,” exclaimed the eldest Miss
Matson, reproachfully, “it is so very easy to give a
good supper&mdash;but not so easy to make the evening
agreeable.”</p>

<p>“Granted!” rejoined the lieutenant: “and I must
candidly admit that no parties are so agreeable as
those at your house.”</p>

<p>“Flatterer!” cried Miss Matson, with a sweet smile.
“I suppose the Browns were at her ladyship’s last
night.”</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly. You meet them every where.”</p>

<p>“And, faith! Miss Amelia Brown is a deuced pleasant
girl&mdash;deuced pleasant,” observed Captain Phinnikin.</p>

<p>“Well, I really never could see any thing particular
in her,” said the eldest Miss Matson. “Besides&mdash;you
know what her grandfather is?” she added, sinking
her voice to a confidential tone, and hastily glancing
around to assure herself that the object of her remark
was not nigh enough to overhear her.</p>

<p>“’Pon my honour, I never heard!” responded Captain
Phinnikin.</p>

<p>“They <em>do</em> say&mdash;but mind, I will not assert it on
my own authority,” continued Miss Matson,&mdash;“at the
same time, I believe it is pretty well ascertained&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly&mdash;beyond all doubt,” exclaimed Miss
Julia, tossing her head contemptuously.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<div id="i_145" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_145.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“<em>I</em> never heard it contradicted!” added Miss Anna-Maria.</p>

<p>“What do they say the grandfather is?” demanded
Captain Phinnikin.</p>

<p>Again did Miss Matson look anxiously around:
then, lowering her voice to a whisper, and assuming
as mysterious an air as possible, she said, “A hatter!”</p>

<p>“Oh! you naughty, gossiping girls!” cried Mrs.
Matson, shaking her head with an affected deprecation
of her daughters’ scandal-loving propensities, but in
reality enjoying the tittle-tattle.</p>

<p>“Well, ma,” said Miss Julia, “I am sure there is no
harm in telling the truth; and I thought that every
one knew what Miss Brown’s grandfather was&mdash;just
the same as it’s no secret about the Greens being related
to a soap-boiler.”</p>

<p>“Hush! my dear,” exclaimed Mrs. Matson, putting
her finger to her lip: “we really must not pull people
to pieces in this way. At the same time I candidly
confess that it <em>is</em> annoying to find so many low persons
at the very watering-place which we chose for
the summer. I don’t wish to be severe upon any
body; but if Mr. Thompson, who is known to be a retired
draper, <em>will</em> allow people to address their letters
to him as <em>Thomas Thompson, Esquire</em>, he must expect
to be talked about.”</p>

<p>“And then those Miss Thompsons who give themselves
such airs!” cried the eldest Miss Matson, with
an indignant gesture.</p>

<p>“I am sure they made quite frights of themselves
last Sunday at church,” added Miss Julia, “with their
dresses after the latest Parisian fashion!”</p>

<p>“Besides, pink bonnets don’t at all become their
dark complexions,” observed Miss Anna-Maria.</p>

<p>“Ladies must have very good complexions indeed,
for pink bonnets to suit them,” drawled forth Captain
Phinnikin, smiling languidly at the same time;&mdash;for
the three Misses Matson all wore bonnets of a roseate
hue&mdash;a fact which they <em>appeared</em> to have entirely forgotten
while speaking of the Misses Thompson.</p>

<p>At this moment, Lieutenant Pink uttered an ejaculation
of surprise; and the rest of the group, turning
their eyes in the same direction in which his were bent,
beheld a very handsome young gentleman to whose arm
hung a young lady of marvellous beauty.</p>

<p>“They are strangers here,” observed Miss Matson
the elder.</p>

<p>“New-comers,” continued Miss Julia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>“But nothing very particular, I dare say,” added
Miss Anna-Maria.</p>

<p>And having thus expressed themselves, the three
sisters turned towards the officers; but they were much
piqued and annoyed to find that those two gallant
gentlemen were still surveying the attractive couple
with the deepest interest.</p>

<p>“That face is familiar to me, Pink,” cried Captain
Phinnikin.</p>

<p>“And to me also. But where I have seen it before,
I cannot recollect,” observed the lieutenant. “Upon
my soul, she is a magnificent woman!”</p>

<p>“A splendid creature!” ejaculated the captain, forgetting
his habitual drawl for a moment. “Faith! I
remember&mdash;&mdash;and yet&mdash;no&mdash;it is impossible!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it <em>is</em> impossible&mdash;it <em>cannot</em> be!” cried Mr.
Pink, as if divining and echoing the other’s thoughts.
“But I am sure I have seen her before! And will you
believe me, Phinnikin, when I assure you that, at the
first glance, I thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Egad! it is her profile&mdash;her figure!” cried the captain,
pursuing the train of his own thoughts, as his
eyes followed the young couple who were passing
leisurely along at a little distance, and quite unconscious
of the interest that one of them at least was
creating.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;it strikes me that it is the same!” observed
the lieutenant, his amazement every moment becoming
greater, and his uncertainty less.</p>

<p>“Who do you take her to be?” demanded Phinnikin,
turning abruptly towards his brother-officer.</p>

<p>“Perdita,” responded the lieutenant, without hesitation.</p>

<p>“And yet&mdash;in England&mdash;so changed too, in circumstances&mdash;and
in company with that genteel young
fellow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All those things occurred to me likewise,” interrupted
Mr. Pink.</p>

<p>“Let us convince ourselves!” cried the captain; and
the military gentlemen, with a somewhat abrupt and
unceremonious bow to the Matson family, walked away
together, arm-in-arm.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” exclaimed the eldest Miss Matson,
now tossing her head more indignantly than on
any previous occasion, yet looking wistfully after the
two really handsome and elegant, though conceited
and coxcombical young officers, whose fine figures
were rapidly receding along the parade.</p>

<p>“I could not have supposed that Captain Phinnikin
would have been guilty of such rudeness!” said Miss
Julia.</p>

<p>“Oh! as for the captain&mdash;I was prepared for any
thing with <em>him</em>,” observed Miss Anna-Maria: “but it’s
Mr. Pink that <em>I’m</em> astonished at!”</p>

<p>“I am sure the captain is the best behaved of the
two,” exclaimed Julia.</p>

<p>“That shows your ignorance, Miss,” said Anna-Maria,
tartly.</p>

<p>“I know what’s genteel as well as you, I should
hope,” retorted Julia.</p>

<p>“Don’t be cross, my love,” said Anna-Maria, affecting
a soothing tone.</p>

<p>“And don’t you pretend to know better than one
two years older than yourself,” cried Julia. “As for
<em>you</em>,” she continued, addressing herself to her eldest
sister, “I was quite surprised to hear how you went
on about the Browns and the Thompsons. How foolish
we should all look if it were found out that Uncle Ben
was a pawnbroker in Lambeth Marsh&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! girls&mdash;hush! Drat your tongues&mdash;how
they are going!” interrupted Mrs. Matson, in a hoarse
and hasty whisper.</p>

<p>“I am sure, ma, Julia talked as much about the
Browns and the Thompsons as I did,” said the eldest
daughter; “and now she is trying to quarrel with me
about it. But here come the Thompsons,” she added
abruptly, as her eyes wandered along the parade.</p>

<p>Mrs. Matson and the three young ladies all smoothed
their countenances in a moment; and nothing could
be more amiable, affable, or charming than the manner
in which they rose simultaneously to greet the Misses
Thompson&mdash;two tall, handsome, well-dressed, and
really most genteel girls, let their father have been
what he might.</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear Miss Thompson,” cried the eldest
Miss Matson, “I am so delighted to see you! How
well you are looking, to be sure!”</p>

<p>“We were talking about you only a few minutes
ago, to Captain Phinnikin and Mr. Pink,” said Julia;
“and we were admiring those dears of bonnets that you
wore last Sunday at church.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you liked them,” responded the elder
Miss Thompson. “But how happened it that you
were not at Lady Noakes’s last night?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;we don’t mind telling you, dear,” said Miss
Matson the elder: “the truth is that we were not invited;
and I suppose it must have been an oversight of
her ladyship.”</p>

<p>“Her ladyship was quite surprised that you were
not present,” returned Miss Thompson: “she assured
me that a card had been duly forwarded to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how provoking!” cried all three Misses Matson
at the same moment, and as it were in the same
breath. “The invitation must have miscarried somehow
or another. We would not have been absent for
the world if we had received the card.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Miss Thompson,” continued the
eldest Miss Matson, “as you and your dear sister are
so intimate with Lady Noakes, perhaps you would just
hint that the invitation did miscarry&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly,” replied the good-natured young
lady thus appealed to. “But we must say good bye
now&mdash;for we promised papa not to stay out late, and it
is already near eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“How is that dear good soul, Mr. Thompson?”
asked Mrs. Matson. “I was speaking of him to Captain
Phinnikin and Mr. Pink just now, and saying
what great respect we all entertained for him.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear madam&mdash;papa is quite well,”
returned Miss Thompson. “But we must really say
good bye, for we expect the Greens to drop into supper
presently&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Delightful girls, the Miss Greens!” exclaimed
Mrs. Matson; “and very well connected, I have
heard.”</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly&mdash;their uncle is a Member of Parliament,”
responded Miss Thompson. “But good bye.”</p>

<p>“Good bye,” repeated her sister; and away they
went&mdash;happy, joyous, kind-hearted, and good girls,
who would not have suffered their tongues to utter a
word of scandal,&mdash;thus proving a striking contrast with
the Matson family.</p>

<p>“What a vulgar buoyancy of spirits the eldest Miss
Thompson always has!” exclaimed the senior of the
three sisters, after a pause. “I really can scarcely
seem commonly polite to her.”</p>

<p>“And the youngest is just like her in that respect,”
observed Julia.</p>

<p>“They are the rudest and worst-behaved girls in
Dover, except the Miss Greens,” added Mrs. Matson.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Anna-Maria, “since I have heard that
the Greens are related to a Member of Parliament, I
don’t fancy them to be so vulgar as I used to do. Oh!
what a thing it would be to get acquainted with a
Member, and have him at our parties next winter!
Wouldn’t the Snipsons be in a way?”</p>

<p>“And the Styles’s!” added Julia.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and the Tubleys, who are so proud of their
Irish Member!” exclaimed the eldest Miss Matson.
“Oh! ma, let us make up to the Greens and get as
friendly with them as possible; so that we may be on
visiting terms with them when we go back to London&mdash;and
then we shall be introduced to their uncle, the
Member.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Mrs. Matson, charmed with
the suggestion. “I will persuade your papa to allow
us to give a party next week, on purpose for the
Greens.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Captain Phinnikin and Mr. Pink
had proceeded somewhat rapidly along the Marine
Parade, until they had reached the extremity, when
they turned, and walked more slowly, so as to meet
Charles Hatfield and Perdita.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, at this time,” said the infatuated
young man, as the syren leant confidingly upon his
arm, “we shall be far on our road to Paris: and within
three days from this moment, my beloved one, you
will be mine! Oh! I believe firmly that we were
intended for each other&mdash;and therefore happiness
awaits us!”</p>

<p>“To be with you, Charles, is happiness indeed,” returned
Perdita, with that melting softness of tone
which gave her words so exquisite a charm, and made
every chord in her lover’s heart thrill with rapture:
then, casting upon him a sweet glance which drank in
his own, she said, “I am rejoiced that we have taken
this decided step&mdash;for in London, I was so fearful that
your relatives might adopt means to separate you
from me!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;that could not be, dearest Perdita,” he observed:
“for I am of an age at which no parental
despotism could be legally enforced; and I have acquainted
you with every thing that has already passed
between my father and myself. Were I a weak-minded
boy, I should perhaps have yielded to his
threats or to my mother’s entreaties: but I have
chosen to act for myself and on my own responsibility&mdash;and
I do not repent the decision.”</p>

<p>“And never&mdash;never shall you repent, my beloved
Charles,” murmured Perdita, with no affectation of
feeling, but under the influence of that passionate tenderness
which she in reality experienced towards the
young man. “And, oh! how delightful is it to be
your companion in such a delicious evening walk as
this&mdash;by the scarcely rippling sea&mdash;and at the hour
when the sun is sinking to its ocean-bed!”</p>

<p>“Yes;&mdash;and while with you, my Perdita,” responded
Charles, “I seem to feel as if we two were alone together&mdash;sole
witnesses of the scene! I observe not the
other loungers: I see only my Perdita&mdash;hear only her
voice!”</p>

<p>At this moment his fair companion, to whom he was
addressing those words of heart-felt tenderness, appeared
to start violently; for his arm to which she
clung was suddenly jerked by her hand with some
degree of force. Charles instinctively raised his head,
which had been bent partially towards her ear; and
glancing straight before him, he beheld two officers
staring most rudely, as he thought, at his well-beloved
and beauteous Perdita.</p>

<p>“What means this insolence?” he exclaimed, in a
tone of irritation.</p>

<p>“Let us turn back, Charles&mdash;dearest Charles” murmured
Perdita, in a faint and tremulous tone; and she
wheeled him round, as it were, with extraordinary
alacrity.</p>

<p>A load burst of laughter on the part of the officers
met their ears; and Charles, uttering an ejaculation of
rage, was about to relinquish his fair companion’s arm
and rush back to demand an explanation, when Perdita
said, “In the name of heaven, molest them not&mdash;I
implore you!”</p>

<p>And she hurried him away.</p>

<p>“My God! Perdita,” he said, when they were at some
distance from the spot where the officers had stopped
short to gaze upon Perdita, and where their complete
recognition of her had betrayed them into an act of
rudeness which they almost immediately afterwards
regretted&mdash;for they felt that they had no right to
insult the young woman by laughing at her altered
circumstances: “my God! Perdita,” said Charles,
labouring under a painful state of excitement; “what
means this conduct of those unmannerly fellows? and
wherefore will you not permit me to chastise them?”</p>

<p>“Would you expose me to the ridicule of all the
persons assembled on the Parade?” demanded Perdita,
who had now recovered her presence of mind&mdash;at least
sufficiently to feel the necessity of immediately allaying
her lover’s excitement.</p>

<p>“But those officers insulted you&mdash;insulted you grossly,
Perdita!” cried Charles, who did not, however, entertain
the remotest suspicion prejudicial to the young
woman, but merely felt deeply indignant at an insolence
which he could not understand, and which was
so completely unprovoked.</p>

<p>“They insulted <em>us</em>&mdash;they insulted <em>you</em> as well as
myself, Charles,” answered Perdita, hastily: “it was
because you were bending, as it were, over me while
you spoke&mdash;because your head was approached so close
to my ear&mdash;and because I was listening with such
unconcealed delight to your tender words! They saw
that we were lovers&mdash;that we felt as if we were alone
even amidst the crowd of loungers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes: it must have been as you say!” cried Charles,
receiving Perdita’s ingenious explanation as natural
and conclusive, and now absolutely wondering at his
own stupidity in not penetrating the matter before.</p>

<p>“You may conceive,” resumed the artful girl, “how
ashamed and bewildered I suddenly felt, when, on
raising my eyes, I saw the two officers standing still only
a dozen yards in advance, and gazing upon us in the
rudest possible manner. I instantly understood the
truth: women, dear Charles, are sometimes more sharp-sighted
than your sex. It flashed to my mind that
our manner had betrayed that we were lovers; and
hence my emotions! And can you wonder, my beloved
Charles, if I hurried you away from a scene where you
incurred the chance of becoming involved in a quarrel
with those fire-eaters?”</p>

<p>“In good truth, my Perdita,” said Hatfield, now
smiling, “they seemed to me&mdash;if I might judge by the
short glimpse I had of them&mdash;to be rather fitted for
the drawing-room than to smell gunpowder.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that may be,” exclaimed the young woman,
her voice still continuing tremulous and her manner
imploring: “nevertheless, I would not for the world
that you should fall into danger! Consider, Charles,
how dreadful would be my feelings, were I to know
that you were about to fight a duel! Oh! my blood
runs cold in my veins when I think of it! But were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
you to fall in such hostile meeting&mdash;&mdash;Ah! my God,
what would become of your unhappy, wretched Perdita?”</p>

<p>“Dearest&mdash;sweetest girl!” cried the enraptured young
man: “how blest am I in the possession of such a
love as thine!”</p>

<p>And he gazed tenderly upon her as he spoke, pressing
her arm at the same time with his own: for now
her countenance was flushed with the emotions that
agitated in her bosom; and, as the rays of the setting
sun played upon her face, she seemed lovely beyond
all possibility of description.</p>

<p>They returned to the hotel; and, having partaken
of supper, sought their respective chambers at a somewhat
early hour&mdash;for Mrs. Fitzhardinge and Perdita
complained of fatigue, and Charles knew that the ensuing
day’s travelling would prove even more wearisome
still.</p>

<p>The reader has seen how artfully the young woman
contrived to find an explanation for the untoward and
menacing event which had occurred upon the Marine
Parade. The real truth was that while Charles was
pouring words of tenderness and love into the ears of
Perdita, she suddenly raised her eyes, and was horror-struck
at beholding the countenances&mdash;too well-known
countenances&mdash;of Captain Phinnikin and Lieutenant
Pink. For their regiment had been stationed at Sydney;
and those two officers had enjoyed the favours of
the beautiful and voluptuous Perdita. She saw that
she was recognised; and for a moment the chances
were equal whether she should sink beneath the blow,
as if struck by a thunder-bolt&mdash;or whether she should
recover her presence of mind. The latter alternative
favoured her on this occasion; and her sophistry, her
demonstrations of tenderness, and the horror which she
expressed at the idea of a duel, succeeded in completely
pacifying her lover.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXLV">CHAPTER CXLV.<br />

<span class="medium">A MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCE.&mdash;THE JOURNEY CONTINUED.</span></h2>

<p>Our travellers rose early in the morning; for the
French mail steamer, <em>Le Courier</em>, was to start for
Calais at nine o’clock.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Charles Hatfield and Perdita walked
down to the pier at twenty minutes to nine&mdash;Mrs.
Fitzhardinge, who was determined to make herself as
busy and also as necessary as possible, remaining
behind to see that the baggage was safely consigned
to the porter in readiness to convey it.</p>

<p>The weather was delightful; and the fresh sea
breeze, with its saline flavour, seemed to waft invigorating
influences upon its wing. Charles and his
beloved were in high spirits; although Perdita threw
ever and anon an anxious glance around, to assure
herself that the dreaded officers, who had caused her
so much alarm on the preceding evening, were not
near to renew that terror. Every thing was satisfactory
in this respect; and never had the heart of the
young woman been more elate, than when she stepped
upon the deck of the gallant steamer, which was
already puffing off its fleecy vapour with a snorting
noise, as if it were a steed impatient of delay.</p>

<p>Seating themselves upon a bench, Charles and
Perdita were soon absorbed in a conversation of a
tender nature; and, forgetful of every thing save the
topic of their discourse, they noticed not the lapse of
time until they happened to perceive the captain
standing on one of the paddle-boxes, and heard the
orders which he gave to the busy French sailors.</p>

<p>These symptoms of immediate departure instantaneously
aroused the attention of Charles and Perdita
to the fact that Mrs. Fitzhardinge had not joined
them.</p>

<p>“Where is my mother?” demanded the latter, embracing
with a rapid glance the entire range of the
deck, and unable to discover the object of her search
amongst the passengers scattered about the vessel.</p>

<p>“Wait here one moment, dearest&mdash;and I will see,”
said Charles; and he hastened forward, thinking that
perhaps the funnel might conceal the old woman from
their view.</p>

<p>But she was not to be found; although a glance at
the piles of baggage in the immediate vicinity of the
chimney showed him his companions’ boxes, together
with a portmanteau of necessaries which he had purchased
for himself on the preceding evening.</p>

<p>Yes: there was the baggage&mdash;but where was Mrs.
Fitzhardinge?</p>

<p>What could have become of her?</p>

<p>Perhaps she had descended to the cabin.</p>

<p>This idea seemed probable; and Charles was about
to hurry back to the bench where he had left Perdita,
when she joined him, saying, “I have been into the
cabin; and my mother is not there.”</p>

<p>Before Charles had time to make any reply, a porter
in his white frock approached him, and, touching his
hat, said, “Please, sir, are these your things?”&mdash;pointing
to the boxes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Hatfield: “but where is the lady
who was giving you instructions about them when
we left the hotel?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, she came after me as far as the beginning
of the pier,” returned the porter; “and there, as
I happened to look round, I saw her speaking to two
men. I went on&mdash;looked round again, and could see
nothing more of her.”</p>

<p>“This is most extraordinary!” exclaimed Hatfield.</p>

<p>“I cannot comprehend it,” observed Perdita: then,
suddenly struck by the idea that Charles might propose
to land and search after the old woman, she
added hastily, “But we need not alarm ourselves: if
any thing has happened to detain my mother a short
time, she will doubtless follow us by the next boat.”</p>

<p>At this moment the huge paddle-wheels began to
turn&mdash;Charles hastily tossed the porter half-a-crown&mdash;and
the man leapt on the pier in company with
several others of his own calling,&mdash;while the steamer
moved away with stately steadiness of pace.</p>

<p>Perdita and Charles Hatfield paced the deck, arm
in arm, and conversing on the unaccountable disappearance
of Mrs. Fitzhardinge. The latter could
conjecture no possible key to the mystery: nor did
Perdita offer any suggestive clue&mdash;although she
thought it probable that her mother, having lost
her despotic authority, had withdrawn, in a moment
of ill-temper, from the company of those whom she
could not hope to reduce to the condition of slaves.
But the young woman said to herself, “She will soon
repent of her folly and rejoin us;”&mdash;while to Charles
she expressed an uneasiness and an apprehension lest
any accident should have befallen her mother.</p>

<p>On sped the steamer: the harbour is cleared&mdash;and
now she enters upon the expanse of green water, over
which she walks “like a thing of life,”&mdash;the huge
paddles raising a swell, which, covered with foam,
marks the pathway of the gallant vessel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>On&mdash;on she went;&mdash;and now the white cliffs of
Albion diminish and grow dim in the distance,&mdash;while,
still far ahead, the coast of France, like a long brown
streak in the horizon, appears in view!</p>

<p>And, oh! may that green sea never waft a hostile
navy from one shore to the other;&mdash;may the peace
which now subsists between the two greatest nations
in the universe, remain undisturbed! Let France and
England continue rivals,&mdash;not in the art of war,&mdash;but
in the means of developing every element of
civilisation and progress. Such a striving&mdash;such a
race between the two, will be glorious indeed; and the
whole world will experience the benefit.</p>

<p>Shame, then, to those alarmists who are now endeavouring
to spread terror and dismay throughout
the British Islands, by their calculations of the facility
with which the French may invade us, and by their
predictions of the consequences of such an invasion.</p>

<p>Well aware are we that were France to entertain the
project, its realization would be easy;&mdash;for with our
navy dispersed over the world, our coast-defences so
few and far-between, and our totally insufficient army,
we have no means of resisting an invading force of
eighty or a hundred thousand men so admirably disciplined
as the soldiers of France.</p>

<p>But neither Louis-Philippe nor his Government entertains
the remotest idea of disturbing the peace of
the world;&mdash;and it is madness&mdash;it in wickedness on the
part of the public journals and of pamphleteers to
write for the very purpose of creating an impression
that an invasion by the French is imminent.</p>

<p>A terrible panic has been raised throughout the
length and breadth of the land;&mdash;and with sorrow do
we record the fact that the <span class="smcap">Duke of Wellington</span>
has placed himself at the head of the alarmists!</p>

<p>To consummate the folly, all that is now required is&mdash;what?</p>

<p><em>To give Prince Albert the command of the Army!</em></p>

<p>----Or rather, O Englishmen! does not the apprehension
of danger from an invasion by a foreign power
lay bare, in all its nakedness, the monstrous folly&mdash;the
astounding absurdity of suddenly elevating that young
and inexperienced man to the rank of a Field-Marshal?</p>

<p>A Field-Marshal, who has never smelt powder save
in the heartless, inhuman cruelty of a <em>battue</em> of game,&mdash;and
who has never in his life seen a shot fired in
anger!</p>

<p>England does not require such a Drawing-Room
Field-Marshal: she wants a Captain-General who, if
need be, can compete with such a man as Bugeaud.</p>

<p>But where will Royal Folly stop?&mdash;and when will
any statesman have the courage to resist the childish
caprices of the Queen?</p>

<p>In the same newspapers which are constantly telling
us that the French meditate an invasion&mdash;that if the
Cuirassiers enter London on the east, the best thing
the Horse-Guards can do, will be to march out on the
west&mdash;that the conquerors will be sure to levy contributions
upon us, demand the settlement of old scores,
strip us of our colonies, and humiliate us in every way,&mdash;in
the very same journals which tell us all this, we
read that <em>the Queen it anxious for Prince Albert to
become Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Wellington
retiring to make room for him</em>!</p>

<p>Merciful heavens! is such a monstrous absurdity to
be consummated? Is that grey-headed veteran, who
won the field of Waterloo, to be superseded by a mere
boy? Much as we have disliked the Duke of Wellington
as a politician, yet we have felt proud of him as our
national hero;&mdash;and no words can convey an idea of
the disgust with which we perused the paragraph
intimating that this mighty warrior was to be put upon
the shelf, to make way for a Prince who knows no
more of military matters than he does of the hieroglyphics
on the Pyramids of Egypt.</p>

<p>If the Duke be desirous of withdrawing into private
life, let him be succeeded by some great Captain who
knows what hard blows in the field are&mdash;let his place
be supplied by one of his own companions-in-arms.</p>

<p>Have we none of the heroes of the Peninsular battles
still alive?&mdash;have we no names rendered glorious by
victories achieved on the banks of the Sutlej?</p>

<p>It would be an insult the most glaring&mdash;the most
flagrant, to all the illustrious chieftains alluded to,
were a young man who never saw an angry shot fired,
to be placed in authority over their heads! Already
have the great warriors of England been sufficiently
humiliated by the elevation of that young man to the
rank of Field-Marshal:&mdash;but really if the English
Court be allowed to “play at soldiers” in this disgraceful
manner, it is no wonder that such men as the Duke
of Wellington should look with apprehension at the
consequences of a French invasion.</p>

<p>Prince Albert may be very resolute and very determined
in worrying a poor otter with his dogs,&mdash;or he
may be desperately brave in firing vollies of small shot
upon harmless birds: but as for his capacity or his
courage to lead an army&mdash;&mdash;the idea is ridiculous!</p>

<p>The English people have not gone stark, staring
mad&mdash;even if some few of their rulers have: and most
sincerely do we hope that, if the attempt to raise
Prince Albert to the post of Commander-in-Chief be
persisted in, the country will oppose it by all moral
and legal means,&mdash;by memorial, petition, and remonstrance,&mdash;by
public meetings and the omnipotent
voice of the public press,&mdash;in fine, by an universal
agitation such as that which knocked down the Corn-Laws!</p>

<p><em>For the consummation of so astounding an absurdity
will prove the ruin of the British Army!</em></p>

<p>Surely it is not in civilised England, and in the
middle of the nineteenth century, that Royalty is to
play its fantastic tricks, and use all our grandest institutions
as playthings? If so, we shall have the Prince
of Wales created on Admiral very shortly, and Dr.
Howley may resign the Archbishopric of Canterbury
to little Prince Ernest Alfred. And why not? Such
appointments would be quite as rational as that of
Prince Albert to the post of Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Let not our readers suppose that we seek to bring
Princes into ridicule: they have a right to be Princes,
if the people are foolish enough to let them; but when
they make themselves ridiculous by grasping at offices
for which they are totally unfitted, it is time for us to
speak out.</p>

<p>We are inspired by no awe and entertain no solemn
terror in dealing with Royalty: for, after all, royal
persons are only human creatures, as well as we&mdash;and
they seldom possess the good feelings and sterling
qualities which are to be found in honest, hard-working,
enlightened mechanics.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a most agreeable voyage of two hours and a
half, the French steam-packet entered Calais harbour.</p>

<p>Charles and Perdita proceeded to Dessin’s Hotel;
and there they determined to wait at least a few hours
until the arrival of an English steamer which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
to leave Dover about a couple of hours later than <cite>Le
Courier</cite>.</p>

<p>During this interval Charles bethought himself
that, should Mrs. Fitzhardinge not join them in the
course of the day, Perdita and himself would be compelled
to continue their journey to Paris; and, with a
due sense of delicacy towards her who was to become
his wife, he saw the impropriety of their travelling
alone together. He accordingly intimated to Perdita
the necessity of procuring for her a lady’s-maid without
delay; and though she would have much preferred
that herself and lover should be the sole occupants
of the interior of the post-chaise, she nevertheless
comprehended that the expression of such a wish on
her part would give him but a poor idea of her modesty.
She therefore assented to his proposal with
apparent cheerfulness, and thanked him for his kind
consideration.</p>

<p>By the agency of Madame Dessin, the landlady of
the hotel, a French lady’s-maid, who understood
English, was speedily obtained and engaged; and
Perdita was now by no means displeased to find
herself elevated to the position of a woman of some
consequence. She, who but a short time before had
entered London in a butcher’s cart and clad in the
meanest apparel, was now provided with a special
attendant and could choose dresses of the latest fashion
and the costliest material.</p>

<p>The lady’s-maid was a pretty young woman of
about three and twenty, with fine hair and eyes, good
teeth, and a beautiful figure; and her attire was of
the most tasteful, though quiet and unassuming,
description. Her manners were very agreeable, and
would be termed lady-like in this country: but, beneath
a modest and innocent-looking exterior, she
concealed a disposition for intrigue and no small
amount of subtlety. At the same time, Rosalie&mdash;for
that was her name&mdash;would not for the world seek to
lead a virtuous mistress astray; and to such virtuous
mistress she would doubtless prove an excellent,
faithful, and trust-worthy servant. But should she
have to deal with a mistress given to gallantry, then
Rosalie would cheerfully exercise all her arts of duplicity&mdash;all
her little cunning machinations&mdash;and all her
aptitude for the management of an intrigue, and
would take delight in enabling her lady to deceive a
husband or a lover.</p>

<p>Such was the young person who now became
Perdita’s attendant: but it must be observed that the
character of Rosalie, as far as it was known to the
landlady of the hotel, was unimpeachable:&mdash;that is to
say, she bore the reputation of honesty, cleanliness, a
perfect knowledge of her duties&mdash;in fine, all those
qualifications which are sought and required in an
upper servant of her description.</p>

<p>Having waited until the arrival of the English
packet, and finding that Mrs. Fitzhardinge did not
make her appearance, Charles, to whom her absence
was unaccountable and bewildering to a degree,
ordered the post-chaise to be got ready; and, while
this was being done, he proceeded with Perdita to the
British Consul’s to obtain passports. Finally, at about
five o’clock in the afternoon, our travellers took their
departure from Dessin’s Hotel in a chaise and four&mdash;Rosalie
occupying a seat inside, for the sake of appearances.</p>

<p>Oh! had Charles Hatfield known that the young
woman&mdash;his intended bride&mdash;for whose reputation he
manifested so much delicate care,&mdash;had he known that
she was so thoroughly polluted in body and mind,&mdash;could
he have heard the history which the two officers
at Dover might have told of her, had they chosen&mdash;he
would have been shocked and horrified,&mdash;he would
have spurned her from him&mdash;and all his ardent, enthusiastic
love, amounting to an adoration and a
worship, would have changed into feelings of abhorrence,
loathing, and hate.</p>

<p>But he believed her to be pure and virtuous,&mdash;possessing
some strange, wayward, and eccentric notions,
it is true,&mdash;and yet endowed with a spirit so plastic
and ductile as to yield willingly to good counsel and
to be ready to sacrifice any peculiarity of opinion to the
man whom she loved.</p>

<p>It is likewise true that he remembered how she had
permitted him, in moments of impassioned tenderness,
to toy with her&mdash;to press her glowing bosom&mdash;to glue
his lips to hers, as if she herself would on those occasions
accord even more: but he likewise recollected
how invariably she started from his arms&mdash;withdrew
herself from his embrace&mdash;and manifested a suddenly
resuscitated presence of mind, when he had grown too
bold and, maddened with desire, had sought the last
favour which a woman, in amorous dalliance, can
bestow. He therefore reasoned that, although her
naturally warm temperament had led her to bestow
upon him such unequivocal proofs of her love, yet that
a virgin pride and a maiden’s prudence had enabled
her in every instance to triumph over temptation;&mdash;and
this belief enhanced his profound admiration of
her character.</p>

<p>But from the moment that Charles had first beheld
Perdita, his brain had been in an incessant state of
excitement,&mdash;an intoxication, an elysian delirium
which made Perdita on angel of beauty and almost of
excellence in his eyes:&mdash;and those fervent caresses
which he had been permitted to bestow upon her, and
those slight foretastes of the most voluptuous enjoyments
which he had been allowed to snatch, had
only tended to sustain that excitement&mdash;increase the
dreamy delights of that intoxication&mdash;and enhance
the bliss of that continuous delirium.</p>

<p>Then, in addition to the fascinating influence of the
syren&mdash;in addition to the enthralling witchery which
her charms, her arts, her conversation, and the silver
sounds of her dulcet voice exercised over him,&mdash;were
his ambitious hopes, his soaring aspirations!</p>

<p>All these circumstances had combined to unsettle,
if not altogether change, in an incredibly short space,
a disposition naturally good&mdash;a mind naturally energetic
and powerful: and then those unhappy scenes
with his father, when neither fully understood the
meaning and drift of the other’s observations, had
aided to produce an excitement which was thus
hurrying the young man along apparently to his
utter ruin!</p>

<p>Unless, indeed, some good angel should yet intervene,
ere it be too late&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But we must not anticipate.</p>

<p>On the contrary, let us return, from this partial
though not unnecessary digression, to the thread of
our narrative,&mdash;so that we may all the sooner be enabled
to bring our readers back to that metropolis&mdash;that
mighty London, of which we have still so many
Mysteries to unfold!</p>

<p>The travellers pursued their journey all night,
Charles being anxious to reach the French capital
with the least possible delay, and Perdita seconding
him fully in the wish.</p>

<p>Let us therefore succinctly state that in the morning
they breakfasted at Amiens&mdash;in the afternoon they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
dined at Beauvais&mdash;and at ten o’clock in the evening
they entered the splendid city of Paris.</p>

<p>Did our limits and the nature of the tale permit us,
we would here gladly pause for a few minutes to
describe that peerless capital which we know and
love so well: but this may not be;&mdash;and we therefore
hasten to state that Charles and Perdita, attended by
Rosalie, proceeded to a respectable family hotel, where
they hired a handsome suite of apartments.</p>

<p>And now for an important event in this section of
our narrative,&mdash;an event which nevertheless may be
related in a few words!</p>

<p>For, at eleven o’clock on the morning following
their arrival in Paris, <em>Charles Hatfield, claiming to
be Viscount Marston, and Perdita Fitzhardinge were
united in the bonds of matrimony, at the British Ambassador’s
Chapel in the Rue Saint Honor&eacute;, and by
the Chaplain to the Embassy</em>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXLVI">CHAPTER CXLVI.<br />

<span class="medium">TWO UNPLEASANT LODGERS.</span></h2>

<p>In the meantime certain little incidents had occurred
in London, which we must faithfully chronicle before
we proceed with the adventures of the newly married
couple,&mdash;adventures, which, could Charles have possibly
foreseen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But we were for a moment oblivious of the scenes
that require our attention in London, and which took
place while Charles Hatfield and Perdita were as yet
on their way to Paris.</p>

<p>Charterhouse Square&mdash;situate between Aldersgate
Street and St. John Street (Smithfield)&mdash;has a mournful,
gloomy, and sombre appearance, which even the
green foliage in the circular enclosure cannot materially
relieve. The houses are for the most part of
antiquated structure and dingy hue&mdash;the windows
and front-doors are small&mdash;and, pass by them when
you will, you never behold a human countenance at
any one of the casements. The curtains and the
blinds,&mdash;and, in the winter time, glimpses of the fires
burning in the parlours,&mdash;these are, to a certain extent,
symptoms that the houses are tenanted: but no
farther signs of the fact can be discovered. Often and
often as we have passed through that Square, we never
beheld a soul coming out of, nor going into, any one
of the gloomy abodes: we have observed a baker’s
boy and a butcher’s ditto hurrying rapidly round&mdash;but
never could satisfy ourselves that either of them
had any particular business there, for they did not
knock at a single door;&mdash;and on one&mdash;and only one
occasion&mdash;when we met a two-penny post-man in the
Square, he seemed to be as much astonished at finding
himself in that quarter as we were to encounter him
there. As for the beadle&mdash;his occupation seems to
consist of lounging about, switching a cane, strolling
into the Fox and Anchor public-house, and chatting
for half-an-hour at a time with the very sober-looking
porter of the Charter House.</p>

<p>There is a something really solemn and awful in
the silence of that Square,&mdash;not a silence and a repose
which seem to afford relief to the mind and rest to
the ear after escaping from the tremendous din of the
crowded streets,&mdash;but a silence that strikes like a
chill to the heart. Whence arises this sensation?&mdash;is
it because, while traversing the Square, we are reminded
that in the vast cloistral building to the north
are pent up eighty old men&mdash;the Poor Brothers of the
Charter House,&mdash;eighty denizens of a Protestant
Monastery in the very heart of civilised London,&mdash;eighty
worn-out and decrepid persons who drag out
the wretched remnant of their lives beneath the iron
sway of a crushing ecclesiastical discipline! Does the
silence of the Square borrow its solemnity from that
far more awful silence which reigns within the
Charter House itself,&mdash;a silence so awe-inspiring&mdash;so
dead&mdash;so tomb-like, that even in the noon of a hot
summer-day, the visitor shudders with a cold feeling
creeping over him as he crosses the cloistral enclosure!</p>

<p>The reader will probably remember that, when Mr.
Bubbleton Styles had propounded his grand Railway
scheme to Captain O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Frank
Curtis, he gave each of those gentlemen a ten-pound
note, desiring them to take respectable lodgings, and
refer, if necessary, to him. We know not precisely
how it happened that the gallant officer and his friend
should have selected Charterhouse Square as the place
most likely to suit them with regard to apartments;
but thither they assuredly did repair&mdash;and in that
gloomy quarter did they hire three rooms: namely, a
parlour on the first floor, and two bed-chambers on
the second. The landlady of the house was a widow;
and, having some small pittance in the shape of
regular income, eked out by letting a portion of her
abode. She was an elderly woman&mdash;tall, starch, and
prim&mdash;and very particular in obtaining good references&mdash;or,
at least, what she considered to be good ones&mdash;respecting
any applicants for her apartments; and
therefore, previously to admitting Captain O’Blunderbuss
and Mr. Frank Curtis into her house, she had
sought all possible information concerning them at the
hands of Mr. Styles. His account was satisfactory,
and the two gentlemen were thereupon duly installed
in their lodgings at Mrs. Rudd’s, Charterhouse Square.</p>

<p>The first two or three days passed comfortably
enough, because the captain and Frank, having ready
money in their pockets, took their dinner and supper&mdash;aye,
and their grog too&mdash;at some convenient tavern,&mdash;troubling
Mrs. Rudd only in reference to their
breakfast, which she cheerfully prepared for them,
because she thereby obtained whole and sole controul
over their groceries. She was a very pious woman,
and attended a Methodist Chapel regularly every
Sunday; but being, as she often expressed herself, “a
lone widow,” she thought there was no harm in using
her lodgers’ tea, sugar, and butter for her own repasts.
“Heaven was very good to her,” she would often tell
her neighbours, “and enabled her to make the most
of her little means:” she might have added&mdash;“and of
her lodgers’ also.”</p>

<p>The captain and Frank, however, soon began to find
that their evening entertainments at the tavern were
very expensive; and, as they could not again draw
upon Mr. Styles for some time&mdash;all his resources being
required for the promotion of the railway&mdash;they
resolved to economise. The best method of carrying
this object into effect, was to take their dinner, supper,
and poteen at home; and Mrs. Rudd, on being sounded in
respect to the plan, willingly assented&mdash;for the excellent
woman felt assured that her lodgers would not
miss a slice or two off a cold joint any more than they
noticed the marvellous disappearance of their groceries.
So the captain and his friend became more domestic;
and as Frank did not get particularly drunk on the
two first evenings, Mrs. Rudd had no complaints to
make.</p>

<p>But at last she began to suspect that she had some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
ground for doubting the steadiness of her lodgers. It
was on a Sunday evening, and the worthy woman had
just returned from chapel, where she had heard a most
refreshing and savoury discourse by the Reverend
Mr. Flummery,&mdash;when, on crossing the threshold of the
house door, and while still ruminating on the truly
Christian manner in which the eloquent minister had
promised hell-flames to all heathens,&mdash;she was suddenly
startled by hearing a terrific noise proceeding from
up-stairs.</p>

<p>She paused&mdash;and listened!</p>

<p>Yes: the sound <em>did</em> emanate from above; and most
strange sounds they were, too. Deeply disgusted&mdash;nay,
profoundly shocked at this desecration of the Sabbath,
Mrs. Rudd crept up stairs; and the nearer she drew
to the parlour-door, the more convinced did she become
that Captain O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Curtis were
fighting a single combat with the shovel and poker.
The conflict was, however, only in fun: for the clash
of the fire-irons was accompanied by tremendous
shouts of laughter, and such ejaculations as these:&mdash;“There,
be Jasus! I have ye again, Frank! Blood and
thunther, keep up your guar-r-d, man! Now, would
ye be afther a feint? Be the powers! and ye can’t
touch me at all, at all! Hit hard, me friend&mdash;niver
mind the damned ould poker-r-r&mdash;the ould woman is
at chapel!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rudd was astounded&mdash;stupefied. Was it possible
that these were the lodgers whom Mr. Styles&mdash;a
respectable “City man”&mdash;had recommended as the
very patterns of quietness and steadiness? Why, if she
had let her rooms to two Bedlamites, things could not
have been worse! She was positively afraid to go in
to remonstrate; and, having recovered the use of
those limbs which wonder had for several minutes
paralysed, she hurried down stairs to consider what
was best to be done, while supping off her racketty
lodgers’ cold joint.</p>

<p>That same night Frank Curtis got so gloriously inebriated,
that he threw up his bed-room window and
treated the whole Square to a specimen of his vocal
powers&mdash;singing some favourite Bacchanalian song,
and introducing the most terrific yells by way of variations.
The captain, who had also imbibed a little too
much, soon after threw up <em>his</em> window, and exerted all
the powers of <em>his</em> lungs in chorus with his friend; so
that the deep, solemn, and awe-inspiring silence of Charterhouse
Square was broken in a fashion that seemed
to surprise the very echoes themselves. Without any
figure of speech, it is certain that the inhabitants were
surprised; for their night, usually passed in such
death-like tranquillity, was unexpectedly and suddenly
“made hideous;” and several nervous old ladies, dwelling
in the neighbourhood, fancied that the frightful
yells were warnings of fire, and went off into strong
hysterics.</p>

<p>Vainly did Mrs. Rudd knock first at the captain’s
door&mdash;then at Frank’s: they heard her not&mdash;or, if they
did, took no heed of her remonstrances;&mdash;and when
the beadle, who had been aroused from his bed, came
and thundered at the front-door, the two lodgers simultaneously
emptied their water-pitchers on his head.
Then, satisfied with this exploit, they closed their
windows and retired to rest.</p>

<p>When they descended to their parlour to breakfast in
the morning, Mrs. Rudd acquainted them, in a tone
evincing the most violent concentration of rage, that
she could not possibly think of harbouring Captain
O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Curtis any longer. But, to
her amazement, they both swore that they were perfectly
innocent of the disturbance of the previous
night,&mdash;alleging that they themselves were as much
annoyed by the row as the landlady herself. Mrs.
Rudd could scarcely believe her ears: had she been
dreaming? No: the noise had really taken place&mdash;for
her lodgers admitted that they had heard it&mdash;though,
to use a common phrase, they swore “eyes
and limbs” that they had not made it. However, she
gave them a week’s warning, and then calmly reminded
them that a week’s rent was already due;
whereupon Captain O’Blunderbuss flew into a terrific
rage at the idea of “the maneness of the woman in
spaking of such a thrifle!” Mrs. Rudd was frightened,
and turned in an appealing manner to Mr. Frank
Curtis, who declared point blank that the captain was
cashier, and that she must draw upon him: but, finding
that the gallant officer was a cashier without cash,
Mrs. Rudd was compelled to retire&mdash;muttering something
about her being “a lone widow,” and intimating
a hope that the two weeks’ rent would be paid
“all in a lump” on the following Monday morning.</p>

<p>The captain and Mr. Curtis now completely threw
off the mask. They no longer affected even to be
“steady, quiet men of regular habits,” as Mr. Styles
had represented them; but they drank poteen “till all
was blue,” as Frank Curtis said&mdash;or, in the language
of the gallant officer, “till they couldn’t see a hole
through a lath-er.” The disturbances they created at
night were hideous; and poor Mrs. Rudd received
from all her neighbours the most positive threats that
they would indict her house as a nuisance. At last, in
the depth of her despair, she had recourse to that excellent
man, the Reverend Mr. Flummery; and the
Reverend Mr. Flummery, having heard her sad tale,
undertook to go in person and remonstrate with “these
men of Belial.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, one afternoon, just as the captain and
Frank had finished a couple of bottles of stout by way
of giving themselves an appetite for dinner, they were
somewhat surprised when the parlour-door was thrown
open, and in walked a short, podgy, red-faced man,
dressed in deep black. Still more amazed were they
when he announced himself as the Reverend Emanuel
Flummery, and stated that he had come to remonstrate
with them on their behaviour towards “a lone
widow.” The captain, winking at Curtis, desired the
minister to be seated, and proposed to discuss the business
over another bottle of stout. His reverence
thought there was something so affable in the offer,
that it would be churlish to refuse it; and he accordingly
gave his assent. The stout was produced; and
Mr. Flummery, being thirsty and hot, enjoyed it
excessively.</p>

<p>He then began a long remonstrance with the two
gentlemen&mdash;the gist of which was that Mrs. Rudd
would be very much obliged to them if they would
pay their rent and remove to other lodgings. The
captain and Frank pretended to listen with attention;
and the reverend minister, finding them in such a
tractable humour, as he supposed, did not choose to
mar the harmony of the interview by declining a
second bottle of stout. Talking had renewed his
thirst&mdash;and, moreover, if there were one special beverage
which the Reverend Emanuel Flummery loved more
than another, it was Guinness’s stout. Accordingly,
he emptied his tumbler, and then continued his remonstrance
and his representations, in which, however
he was cut short by a sudden pain in the stomach&mdash;doubtless
produced by the effervescent malt liquor.
The captain was prompt with a remedy; and Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Flummery had swallowed a good dram of whiskey
before an eye could twinkle thrice. Thus cheered, and
finding the two gentlemen most docile and respectful,
his reverence consented to partake of a hot glass of
toddy with them, just to convince them that he was
inclined to be friendly;&mdash;and this one glass led to a
second&mdash;and then Frank Curtis cunningly brewed him
a third, while the reverend minister was expatiating
upon the good qualities of Mrs. Rudd. In fine, Mr.
Emanuel Flummery became so much disguised in
liquor, that, when he took his leave, he swore the
captain and Frank Curtis were two excellent gentlemen&mdash;begged
them not to put themselves to any inconvenience
in moving&mdash;and assured them that he would
make it all right with the landlady.</p>

<div id="i_153" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_153.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mrs. Rudd, however, was mightily shocked when
she beheld the condition in which the reverend gentleman
presented himself at her own parlour-door; and
she could indeed scarcely believe her eyes. But when,
after hiccupping out some unintelligible words, that
self-same reverend gentleman&mdash;the pastor of an admiring
flock, and whose sermons were so refreshing
and so savoury,&mdash;when <em>he</em>,&mdash;the individual whom she
had looked upon as the essence of human perfection,&mdash;when
<em>he</em>, we say, cast his arms around her neck and
administered to her somewhat wrinkled cheeks a
hearty smack,&mdash;<em>then</em>, what did she do? Why&mdash;she
put up with the affront&mdash;doubtless to save the reputation
of the minister;&mdash;and, perhaps with the same
charitable desire to avoid the scandal of an exposure,
she permitted him to repeat his caresses as often as
he chose during the half-hour that he remained in
her company. She even made him some tea, which
materially tended to sober him; and, when he had at
length taken his departure, she muttered several times
to herself, “Well&mdash;after all, this saint of a man is
mere flesh and blood like any other!”</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Rudd’s more pleasurable reflections
had ceased,&mdash;for pleasurable they certainly were, both
during the reverend gentleman’s presence and for a
short time after the door had closed behind him,&mdash;she
remembered that her disagreeable lodgers were, still in
the house, notwithstanding the remonstrances which,
according to his statement to the widow, the pious
minister had most eloquently addressed to them. And
that they <em>were</em> still in the dwelling, she was very soon
made to understand;&mdash;for the obstreperous behaviour
of those “dreadful men,” to use Mrs. Rudd’s own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
words, recommenced in the form of the most hearty
peals of laughter&mdash;and the clashing of the fire-irons&mdash;and
the stamping of feet, as if the two gentlemen were
mad.</p>

<p>“They have begun their booze,” said Mrs. Rudd to
herself, looking up in despair at the ceiling, as if she
thought the captain and his friend must inevitably
come through upon her devoted head. “But never
mind!” she suddenly exclaimed aloud, as a thought&mdash;a
very bright thought struck her: “I will put up with
it for this once&mdash;and to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Rudd stopped short; for she would not
even trust the empty air with the lucid idea which
had struck her.</p>

<p>We may however inform our readers that this said
idea was nothing more nor less than to lock out the
two gentlemen when they went for their usual walk
on the morrow.</p>

<p>Tranquillized by the excellence of the scheme, Mrs.
Rudd refreshed herself with a small drop of brandy,
and then spread her huge Bible open on the table
before her&mdash;not to read it, but merely because “it
looked pious-like,” as she thought, if any of her neighbours
should happen to drop in. For Mrs. Rudd
delighted in the reputation for sanctity which she
enjoyed amongst her acquaintances in general, and
the frequenters of the reverend gentleman’s chapel
in particular.</p>

<p>Let us now return to Mr. Frank Curtis and Captain
O’Blunderbuss, who, as the landlady rightly concluded,
were enjoying themselves in their own peculiar
fashion up-stairs.</p>

<p>Having partaken of a cold joint, and the slip-shod
girl of the house having provided them with a jug of
hot water, the two gentlemen commenced the evening’s
orgie. The whiskey-punch which they brewed was of
that kind which is libellously alleged to be peculiarly
affected by ladies&mdash;namely, “hot, strong, and plenty
of it;”&mdash;and, under its influence, they soon manifested
their wonted exuberance of spirits. First, Captain
O’Blunderbuss would insist upon giving Frank a lesson
with the broad-sword&mdash;the one using the poker,
and the other the shovel;&mdash;and every time the gallant
officer thrust his friend in the ribs, a hearty shout of
laughter burst from their lips&mdash;for they considered it
prime fun.</p>

<p>When they were tired of this amusement, they resumed
their seats&mdash;replenished their glasses&mdash;and
chatted on divers matters interesting to themselves.
Presently Frank started up, and leapt over a chair in
order to show his agility, although he had grown
somewhat stout of late years;&mdash;and as he acquitted
himself in a clumsy manner, the captain volunteered
to teach him how to do it. But the gallant officer
only tumbled over the chair, causing a tremendous
split in his trousers&mdash;an accident at which they nevertheless
both laughed more heartily than ever.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus!” cried the captain, “and it’s the only
pair of unmintionables that I possess! But niver mind:
I’ll be afther telling the gal to take them round to
the tailor’s the first thing in the morning; and so I’ll
take my breakfast in bed, Frank. They’ll soon be
sent home again.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see? we’ve got to meet Styles to-morrow at
three in the afternoon,” said Curtis; “and, by Jove!
we must make him come down with the dust.”</p>

<p>“Be the power-rs! and you’re right, my frind!”
exclaimed the captain. “It’s eighteen-pince that’s
left in my pocket at this prisint spaking&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And nothing at all in mine,” interrupted Frank,
both his hands diving at the same time down into the
depths of the empty conveniences alluded to. “Deuce
take this railway affair! It gets on precious slow.
I remember when I was in Paris two or three-and-twenty
years ago, they were making a new path-way
through my friend the Archbishop’s estate at Fontainbleau;
and if his Grace didn’t go and swear at
the men all day long, they never would have got on
with it.”</p>

<p>“Be the power-rs! if it’s a thrifle of swearing that
would make Misther Styles push a-head,” said the
gallant officer, “I’m the boy to help him on with
that same.”</p>

<p>“You see there’s been what they call a tightness
in the Money-Market lately,” observed Frank: “at
least, that’s what Styles told me the other day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And it’s an infer-r-rnal tightness that’s got hould
of <em>our</em> Money-Market, my frind,” interrupted the
captain. “Be Jasus! there’s the potheen bottle empty&mdash;and
no tick at the public!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got eighteen-pence in your pocket, captain,”
suggested Curtis.</p>

<p>“Right, me boy!”&mdash;and he rang the bell furiously.</p>

<p>The slip-shod girl answered the summons, and was
forthwith despatched for a supply of whiskey at the
wine-vaults which the lodgers honoured with their
custom.</p>

<p>“Now we’re altogether aground,” said Curtis, after
a pause which had followed the departure of the servant.
“But we’ve every thing necessary in the
house for to-morrow morning’s breakfast, except the
milk&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And bar-r-ring my breeches, ye spalpeen!” cried
the captain. “They must be immediately menthed,
any how.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the tailor won’t think of asking for the money
when he brings them home,” said Curtis: then, beholding
the comical expression of his friend’s countenance,
which was elongated with sore misgivings respecting
the amount of confidence the snip might
choose to put in his honour, Frank burst out into a
tremendous fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“Arrah! and be Jasus! and it’s all mighty fine for
you, Misther Curtis, to make a damned fool of yourself
in that fashion,” exclaimed Captain O’Blunderbuss,
becoming as red as a turkey-cock: “but I can assure
ye that it’s no joking matther for me to contimplate
the prospict of lying in bed for a week or two till I
get my breeches back again. And now, if you’re not
afther houlding your tongue, Frank, I’ll tip ye a small
rap on the head with the poker&mdash;by the howly
poker-r, I will!”</p>

<p>“Don’t get into a rage, captain,” said Curtis, putting
a bridle upon his mirth in consequence of the
threat just held out&mdash;a threat which he knew his
amiable friend was perfectly capable of putting into
force. “I will go out the first thing in the morning
and see Styles&mdash;and I have no doubt he will give me
some money. I shall be back again by the time the
tailor comes home with&mdash;with&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The unmintionables!” vociferated the captain, his
wrath reviving as he saw that his friend was once
more on the point of giving vent to a hearty cachinnation.
“But here’s the gal coming up stairs with
the potheen; and so we’ll be afther enjoying ourselves
for the prisint, and think of the tightness of the
Money-Mar-r-rket in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, what the deuce has made you so long?” demanded
Frank Curtis, as the slip-shod domestic entered
the room.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>“Long, sir!” echoed the girl, as if in surprise.
“Lor, sir&mdash;I ain’t been a minit!”</p>

<p>“Not a minute!” cried Frank, who always bullied
servants&mdash;when they weren’t footmen who could knock
him down for his impudence: “I tell you, you’ve been
more than a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir&mdash;and if so be I have,” said the girl, suddenly
recollecting something which had occurred to
hinder her on her errand, “it was because as I went
out of the street-door a man come up and asked me
if so be as Mr. Smith lived here. ‘<em>No</em>,’ says I: ‘<em>he
don’t.’&mdash;‘Well, then</em>,’ says the man, ‘<em>Mr. Brown
does.’&mdash;‘No, he don’t, though</em>,’ I says, says I; ‘<em>nor
yet Mr. Jones, nor Mr. Noakes neether.’&mdash;‘Well, who
does live here, then?</em>’ says the man; and as I thought
it would teach him not to be so precious knowing
another time, I out and told him slap as how two
gentlemen lived here as was named Blunderbuss&mdash;leastways,
O’Blunderbuss, and Curtis.”</p>

<p>“The devil you did!” ejaculated the two lodgers
as it were in the same breath, and exchanging significant
glances which expressed the same apprehension.</p>

<p>“To be sure I did, sir,” responded the girl, not
perceiving the alarm which she had created in the
minds of the gentlemen, but rather attributing their
excited ejaculations to an approval of her conduct:
“for I thinks to myself, thinks I, ‘<em>Now, my fine
feller, you’ll believe that there’s no Smiths or Browns
here; and you won’t be quite so positive another
time.</em>’”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;and what did the man say?” demanded
Frank Curtis, darting another uneasy glance at his
friend.</p>

<p>“He only said ‘<em>Oh!</em>’ and went away,” returned the
girl; “and that’s what kept me a little in going&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What sort of a looking fellow was he?” asked
Curtis.</p>

<p>“He warn’t a gentleman, sir&mdash;and he smelt horrible
of drink,” said the domestic.</p>

<p>“But what should you take him for?” demanded
Frank, impatiently.</p>

<p>“A thief, sir,” was the ingenuous response.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and thin it’s a shiriff’s&mdash;&mdash;” ejaculated
Captain O’Blunderbuss, starting in his chair:
but, instantly stopping short ere he completed the
sentence, he added in a few moments and in a less
excited tone, “You may go down stairs, my dear;
and if any one comes and asks for Misther Frank
Cur-r-tis or Captain O’Bluntherbuss, ye must deny
us, mind&mdash;or I’ll be afther skinning ye alive!”</p>

<p>“Lor, sir!” cried the girl; and, horrified by the
dreadful threat, she hastened from the room as if the
individual who had uttered the menace were preparing
to carry it into execution.</p>

<p>For some few minutes after she had taken her departure,
Captain O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Curtis sate
eyeing each other in silence,&mdash;the same idea evidently
occupying both&mdash;and both fearful to express it; as if
to give utterance to the thought were positively to
meet the dreaded misfortune half-way.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Curtis, at length, “and what
do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and it’s what do <em>you</em> think of it?”
cried the captain.</p>

<p>“For my part I think it’s Rumrigg and Kaysay
the lawyers, who’ve found out where we are, and mean
to take us on that cursed cognovit we gave them last
Christmas for the discounter’s affair,” said Mr. Curtis,
who, having now fully expressed his fears, no longer
hesitated to look particularly blank upon the matter.</p>

<p>“Faith! and that same’s my opinion also,” exclaimed
the gallant officer; then, grasping the poker
very tight in his hand, he said, “But if the thunthering
villains of shiriff’s-officers crape into this house,
it’s myself that’ll sind ’em out again with a flay
in their ear. So don’t make yourself unhappy at all,
at all, my frind; but let’s dhrink bad luck to the bastes
of the airth!”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” cried Frank, brewing for himself
a strong glass of toddy. “The only thing is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is what?” demanded the captain, suddenly desisting
from his occupation of mixing a tumbler of grog
for himself, and fixing his eyes sternly upon his
friend.</p>

<p>“The breeches,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>“Ah! now&mdash;and can’t ye be asy about those same
unmintionables?” cried the gallant officer. “I suspicted
it was afther them ye was harping again and
again. It’ll become a sore subject in time, Frank.
So dhrink&mdash;and bad luck to the inexprissibles.”</p>

<p>And the two gentlemen did drink, until the bottle
was empty, when they retired to rest&mdash;the captain
having previously informed the servant-girl that he
should leave his trousers outside his chamber door,
and that she must take them round to the tailor the
very first thing in the morning, with instructions for
him to mend and return them as speedily as possible.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXLVII">CHAPTER CXLVII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE CAPTAIN’S LUDICROUS ADVENTURE.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Curtis arose at a very early hour&mdash;at least for
him,&mdash;it being only eight o’clock when he sallied forth
with the intention of seeking Mr. Bubbleton Styles,
on whose purse he contemplated as deep an inroad as
that gentleman’s circumstances would permit.</p>

<p>But before he quitted the house, he partook of
breakfast, and likewise carried in some tea and toast
to his friend the captain, who was compelled, “under
painful circumstances,” as Frank observed, to keep
his bed for an hour or two. The gallant officer charged
his companion and ally to return without delay&mdash;the
prudence of shifting their quarters as soon as convenient,
being strongly suggested by the enquiries
instituted regarding them on the preceding evening.</p>

<p>Having disposed of his breakfast. Captain O’Blunderbuss
turned himself round in his bed and took a
nap&mdash;in which luxurious state of light and dreamy
repose he remained for upwards of an hour, when he
was suddenly awakened by a low, sneaking, suspicious
kind of double knock at the street-door.</p>

<p>He started up in bed; and, as he hastily collected
his scattered ideas, the affair of Rumrigg and Kaysay
flashed to his mind.</p>

<p>Leaping from his couch as a chesnut bounces from
a shovel on the fire, Captain O’Blunderbuss pulled on
his stockings, thrust his feet into his slippers, and
stole out upon the landing, where he held his breath
and listened attentively.</p>

<p>At that very instant the servant-girl, who invariably
kept people waiting at the door as long as possible,
answered the summons; and the captain overheard the
following colloquy.</p>

<p>“Is the genelmen at home, my dear?” asked a rough,
harsh, grating voice.</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re the one that stopped and spoke to me
last evening,” responded the girl.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>“Just so: but it was o’ny to make a few civil enquiries
consarning your missus’s lodgers. I ’spose
they’re at home; and so me and my friend will just
walk up, my dear&mdash;‘cause our business is partickler.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, it ain’t of no use to go up now,” said
the servant-girl: “for Mr. Curtis has gone out, and
the captain isn’t out of bed&mdash;leastways, he hasn’t left
his room yet; and he brekfusted there.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, my dear,” persisted the man with the
hoarse voice: “we’ll just walk up and pay our respeks
to the captain, who is a wery nice genelman no
doubt.”</p>

<p>From this conversation the gallant officer learnt
that there were <em>two</em> persons enquiring for him, although
<em>one</em> only appeared to speak in the matter. His worst
suspicions were confirmed: they were bailiffs, come to
arrest him on the cognovit given jointly by himself
and his inseparable friend Mr. Francis Curtis to those
astute gentlemen, Messrs. Rumrigg and Kaysay.</p>

<p>What was to be done? He must dress himself in
all possible haste, and fight his way desperately out of
the house!</p>

<p>This was his first idea.</p>

<p>But it was so easy to think of dressing&mdash;and so
difficult to carry the scheme into execution: for, alas!
the gallant officer’s unmentionables were at the tailor’s;
and he knew that Frank possessed not a second pair!</p>

<p>What, then, was to be done?</p>

<p>Should he surrender himself into the hands of the
officers, and be borne ignominiously to Whitecross
Street? The thought was ridiculous with such a man
as Captain O’Blunderbuss!</p>

<p>Locking his own door, and taking the key with him,
he scud up to the top storey, and sought refuge in the
bed-chamber of Mrs. Rudd, who, he felt assured, had
gone out to market as usual&mdash;otherwise she would
have been certain to emerge from her parlour below
and join in the conversation which had taken place
between the bailiffs and the servant-girl.</p>

<p>The captain’s first thought, in thus flying to his
landlady’s bed-chamber, was merely to seek refuge
there, and leave the officers to suppose that he had
gone out. It struck him that they would knock at his
door&mdash;would force open that door on not receiving any
answer&mdash;and would then conclude that he really was
not at home. In the meantime he should have leisure
to decide upon the best means of ultimately avoiding
the bailiffs altogether.</p>

<p>But scarcely had he entered Mrs. Rudd’s room
when a new and truly magnificent idea suggested
itself&mdash;or rather, was suggested by the fact that an
open cupboard revealed the worthy landlady’s best silk
gown, while upon a chest of drawers stood the good
woman’s Sunday bonnet, to which she had been
putting a new ribband that very morning before she
went out. The bonnet, which was of fine straw and
of a large shape, was provided with an ample blue
gauze veil; for Mrs. Rudd liked to be smart on the
Sabbath&mdash;if it were only to compete with her female
neighbours who attended the “ministry” of the
Reverend Emanuel Flummery.</p>

<p>The appearance of the two articles of dress just
specified, determined the gallant officer how to act; and
his arrangements were made with almost lightning
speed.</p>

<p>The reader will recollect that he had no clothes at
the moment to put off before he put others on&mdash;he
having sought the landlady’s room in his shirt,
stockings, and slippers. To slip into the silk dress
was therefore the work of an instant: to assume the
Leghorn bonnet was an affair accomplished with
equal speed;&mdash;and to ransack the widow’s drawers for
a shawl was a matter scarcely occupying ten seconds.
Then, drawing the veil in thick folds over his
moustachioed and whiskered countenance with one
hand, and grasping Mrs. Rudd’s parasol in the other,
Captain O’Blunderbuss took a hasty survey of himself
in the glass, and was perfectly satisfied with the
result.</p>

<p>We have before stated that Mrs. Rudd was very
tall, starch, and prim; and the reader is aware that
Captain O’Blunderbuss was no dwarf&mdash;neither was he
particularly stout. Thus, although he certainly appeared
a very colossal woman, he might still pass as
one at a pinch&mdash;and surely need was never more
pinching than on the present occasion. At all events
he was resolved to make the attempt; and the
exciting nature of the incident was just of the kind
which he particularly relished&mdash;though, perhaps, he
would rather have had the fun without the danger of
the thing.</p>

<p>In the meantime he had not been in a state of
ignorance of what was passing on the landing of the
floor below; for the bailiffs, having ascended to that
height, stopped at his own chamber door, at which
they knocked. But receiving no answer, the one with
the hoarse voice exclaimed, “Captain O’Blunderbuss,
I’ve got a message for you wery particklar from a
friend of your’n.”</p>

<p>Still there was no response; and the man, addressing
himself to the servant-girl, asked her if she were sure
that the captain was at home.</p>

<p>“I’m certain he is,” was the reply; “because he’s
sent out his&mdash;his&mdash;trousers to be mended, and is lying
a-bed till they come back.”</p>

<p>“But mayn’t he have another pair?” demanded
the bailiff.</p>

<p>“I don’t b’lieve he have,” said the girl: “leastways,
I never see more than one either on or off him.”</p>

<p>“Then the captain <em>is</em> at home,” growled the sheriff’s-officer;
“and we must do our dooty, Tom.”</p>

<p>These last words were evidently addressed by the
speaker to his companion; and the captain comprehended
that the forcing of the door would be the next
step. Nor was he wrong in his conjecture;&mdash;for,
before the servant girl could divine the intention of
the two men, they had effected an entrance into the
chamber which the gallant officer had only quitted
three minutes previously.</p>

<p>The captain, who had been listening at the door of
Mrs. Rudd’s own bed-room, now partly descended the
stairs, and again stood still to listen&mdash;his proceedings
being conducted as noiselessly and cautiously as possible.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I’m blowed if he’s here!” exclaimed the
bailiff with the hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“No more than a cat,” returned his companion.</p>

<p>“How’s this, my dear?” continued the first speaker:
“have you been a-making fools on us?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the girl sharply: “I thought the
captain was here&mdash;but he ain’t. So I s’pose he’s
gone out without my hearing or seeing him. But now
you’ve broke the lock of the door and must pay for
it&mdash;or else missus will blow me up finely when she
comes home from market.”</p>

<p>“Then she <em>is</em> at market,” said Captain O’Blunderbuss
to himself, his hopes becoming more elated by
the assurance thus conveyed to him through the
servant-girl’s remark to the bailiffs.</p>

<p>“Pay for it, indeed!” growled the one with the
hoarse voice. “That won’t suit our books neither.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
S’pose we fix the lock on agin in such a way that
it won’t be knowed as how we ever busted the door
open at all?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;do what you like; but make haste about
it, ’cause missus is sure to come home in a minit or
two&mdash;leastways if she’s raly out; for I didn’t see her
go. But I s’pose she is&mdash;or else she’d have been down
afore this to know what all the row’s about.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see to it, my dear,” observed the hoarse-speaking
bailiff. “But I say, Tom&mdash;here’s the captain’s
cap, and coat, and veskitt. Bless’d if I believe he’s
gone out arter all! Let’s search t’other rooms: this
gal is a-playing tricks with us.”</p>

<p>“Come into Mr. Curtis’s chamber and see,” exclaimed
the juvenile servant; and the captain heard the party
pursuing their domiciliary visit in the quarter alluded
to. “Well, now?” said the girl, with a derisive laugh:
“is he there? Oh! ah! you may look under the bed!
Why don’t you search the drawers&mdash;or get up the
chimley and look out on the tiles?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be sarsy, my dear,” growled the bailiff.
“Come&mdash;here’s a shillin’ for you. Now tell us the
truth&mdash;ain’t the captain somewhere in the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I’m sure he be,” returned the girl; “’cause
his breeches is gone to be mended, and his coat and
wescutt and cap is in his own room&mdash;and I know he
ain’t got two suits of clothes. Besides,” she added,
sinking her voice to a tone of mysterious confidence&mdash;though
not so low as to be inaudible to the gallant
officer on the stairs above, “his bluchers is down stairs
to be blacked&mdash;and I’ll swear he ain’t got two pair
of them.”</p>

<p>“Then he is in the house,” said the bailiff. “Now,
Tom, I tell’ee what we must do. You stay here, and
me and the gal will just toddle down stairs and look
in the kitchen, and scullery, and sich-like places.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but you must put the lock right first,” exclaimed
the girl; “for if missus&mdash;Lor! here she is!”
added the affrighted servant, in a hurried whisper.</p>

<p>The fact was that the captain, by some awkward
and unintentional movement, at that very instant
rustled the silk gown loud enough for the sound to
catch the ears of the girl and the bailiffs; and he was
about to curse his folly, when, finding that all had
suddenly become still on the floor below, it instantly
struck him that the juvenile servant had imposed
silence on the officers for fear her mistress should stop
to enquire the cause of their presence and thereby
notice the damaged lock.</p>

<p>He was perfectly correct in his conjecture: and,
perceiving that the sudden stillness remained unbroken,
he boldly descended the stairs&mdash;imitating as well as he
could the measured walk of the sanctimonious landlady,
and treading with feminine lightness in his slippers.</p>

<p>On reaching the landing&mdash;the dreaded landing
whence opened the room where the officers were concealed
with the servant girl&mdash;Captain O’Blunderbuss
felt a violent inclination to make a precipitate rush
down the remainder of the stairs to the bottom: but,
fearing that such a proceeding would only lead to his
capture, as it was certain to excite an instantaneous
suspicion of the truth and a vigorous pursuit in consequence,
he pursued his way with measured tread,
taking good care to rustle the silk dress as much as
possible.</p>

<p>The landing of the first floor was gained in safety:
he was descending the last flight&mdash;and his escape
appeared certain,&mdash;when a loud double knock at the
front-door echoed through the dwelling.</p>

<p>For an instant the gallant officer was staggered: but
a second thought convinced him that it was not his
landlady’s knock&mdash;and he sped boldly on.</p>

<p>Drawing his veil as closely as possible over his
countenance, and tucking the parasol under his arm
for the moment, he opened the front-door.</p>

<p>The visitor was the Rev. Mr. Emanuel Flummery.</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear madam,” said that pious man, stepping
into the passage with all the unceremonious ease of a
familiar friend, and not at the instant noticing the
extraordinary height of the person whom he thus
addressed; “I looked in just to ask you how you were&mdash;and&mdash;and,”
he added, sinking his voice to a low
whisper, “for the purpose of tasting in your arms a
renewal of those favours which you yesterday&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But to the ineffable wonderment of the reverend
gentleman, the fictitious Mrs. Rudd dealt him such a
sudden and violent blow with a heavy clenched fist,
just between his two eyes, that he was floored on the
spot; and the captain seizing the front-door key, darted
out of the house.</p>

<p>Banging the door behind him, the gallant officer
locked it, and marched away with a haste and a manliness
of step which, had any one been passing at the
time, would have betrayed his real sex in a moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, it struck him that he was playing
a female character; and, instantly relaxing his
speed, he assumed a gait so mincing, affected, and
fantastic, that his appearance was most comical and
ludicrous.</p>

<p>He put up the parasol, and held it so as to screen his
countenance, over which he likewise kept the blue
gauze veil in many folds; and, in this manner, the
gallant gentleman pursued his way half round the
Square&mdash;not daring to take precipitately to his heels,
yet fearful every instant of hearing a hue and cry
raised behind him.</p>

<p>“Lauk-a-daisy me!” cried a female voice, suddenly
breaking upon the captain’s ears, and speaking close by.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! mim&mdash;and is it yourself?” ejaculated
the gallant gentleman, stopping short: “because it’s
me that’s afther being Misthress Rudd just at the
prisint spaking!”</p>

<p>“You Mrs. Rudd!” exclaimed the infuriated landlady.
“Here&mdash;murder&mdash;thieves&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hould, mim!” said the captain, in a tone so ferocious
that it silenced the woman in an instant: “if
ye’re afther raising an alarm, mim, I’ll bethray ye to
all the wor-r-ld for having bestowed your favours yesterday
on that spalpeen of a methodist parson&mdash;that
will I, Misthress Rudd, and bad luck to ye!”</p>

<p>The landlady was thunderstruck&mdash;astounded.</p>

<p>“So now, mim, just walk on quietly to your own
house, of which I hereby prisint ye with the kay,”
continued the captain; “and mind ye don’t look once
behind ye until ye reach your own door&mdash;and I’ll sind
your toggery back again this evening&mdash;and you’ll be
sure to give mine to the missinger that brings yours,
paying likewise for my throusers, mim. And bewar-r-r,
mim,” added the gallant gentleman, with a terrific
rattling of the r’s, “how ye bethray me in any way&mdash;if
ye valley the sacret of your indecent proceedings
with the methodist parson.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the captain handed the bewildered
Mrs. Rudd the key of her house, and hurried on.</p>

<p>From the moment that he had quitted the dwelling
until the termination of this scene, scarcely three
minutes had elapsed: but the captain was well aware
that the bailiffs would not be much longer before they
discovered his flight, as the Rev. Mr. Flummery,
whom he had so unceremoniously knocked down in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the passage, would speedily and inevitably give them
such information as would open their eyes to the real
truth of all the recent proceedings.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the gallant gentleman’s object was to
get away from Charterhouse Square within the shortest
space of time possible; and the moment he parted from
Mrs. Rudd he struck into the Charter House itself,
under the impression that there was a thoroughfare in
this direction.</p>

<p>But before he turned under the gloomy archway of
that monastic establishment, he looked round and
beheld the landlady still standing on the spot where
he had left her&mdash;motionless, and apparently petrified
with horror and astonishment at the threats which he
had held out. Her back was, however, turned towards
him,&mdash;and he therefore felt more at ease in his mind
as he entered the Charter House.</p>

<p>“Who do you want, mem?” said the porter, as he
emanated from his crib.</p>

<p>But Captain O’Blunderbuss affected not to hear the
challenge, and passed on&mdash;adopting that mincing
affectation of gait which we have before noticed, and
which made him appear such a comical figure.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blowed if I ever see sich a o’oman!”
mattered the porter to himself, as he returned to his
lodge. “Vonderful giantesses ain’t nothink to her.
And her petticuts&mdash;my eye! ain’t ’em short too?
But she hasn’t a wery bad leg neither&mdash;though her
stockins might be a trifle or so cleaner.”</p>

<p>The captain continued his way,&mdash;still shading his
head with the parasol&mdash;still keeping the veil closely
folded over his countenance,&mdash;but not the less able to
reconnoitre the place in which he now found himself
for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>He beheld a wide, open space, laid out in grass plats,
bordered and intersected by gravel walks, and surrounded
by low continuous buildings, of uniform architecture
and cloistral appearance.</p>

<p>Here and there were scattered groups of old men&mdash;collected
in knots of threes and fours, and apparently
basking in the summer sun, which warmed their frames
so attenuated and chilled by age. They did not appear
happy&mdash;scarcely comfortable or contented;&mdash;and could
the captain have overheard the remarks which they
mumbled and muttered to each other, he would have
found that they loathed and detested&mdash;hated and
abhorred the monastic gloom, the rigid discipline, and
the monotonous course of life to which necessity had
consigned them.</p>

<p>When the gallant officer made his appearance in
this enclosure, his strange and ludicrous figure instantly
attracted the notice of the various groups
alluded to; and the old fellows began to wonder
whom the tall, stately-looking dame was about to
honour with a visit.</p>

<p>But by this time Captain O’Blunderbuss had arrived
at the unpleasant conviction that there was no
thoroughfare either into Goswell Street or Wilderness
Row; and he once more found himself, as he subsequently
observed, “in a divil of a pother.”</p>

<p>The reader is, however, well aware that our gallant
friend was not precisely the man to turn back and
surrender to his enemies, who, he felt assured, must
by this time be instituting an active search after him
in the vicinity&mdash;even if they had not become aware
that he had sought refuge in the Charter House.</p>

<p>What was to be done?</p>

<p>Nothing&mdash;save to enlist some kind inmate of the
establishment in his interests;&mdash;and on this proceeding
he at once decided.</p>

<p>From an upper window he beheld a good-natured,
red, round, jolly face looking forth, the casement
being open;&mdash;and a rapid glance showed the captain
the staircase that led to the particular room in which
the proprietor of that face must be.</p>

<p>He accordingly walked on with the steady pace and
apparent ease of a person who had the assurance of
knowing his&mdash;or should we not rather say <em>her</em>&mdash;way;&mdash;and
entering the building, he ascended the stairs,
until he reached a door on which was a brass-plate
bearing the name of <span class="smcap">Mr. Scales</span>.</p>

<p>Without any ceremony, the captain walked into
the room; and the gentleman with the red face, turning
away from the window, began to contemplate his
supposed visitress with the most profound amazement.</p>

<p>But how much was this surprise enhanced, when
the apparent lady threw down the parasol, exclaiming
in a voice of singularly masculine power, “Bad luck
to ye! ye damned spalpeen of an umbrilla!”&mdash;and
then immediately afterwards raised a veil which revealed
a face embellished with a fierce pair of moustachios
and a very decent pair of whiskers&mdash;to say
nothing of a certain ferociousness of expression and a
weather-beaten complexion, which added to the unfeminine
appearance of the whole countenance.</p>

<p>“What the deuce does all this mean?” demanded
the Brother of the Charter House, at length recovering
the use of his tongue, and with difficulty subduing an
inclination to laugh;&mdash;for he was a jolly old bird, as
his face denoted, and doubtless fancied that some
masquerading amusement was in progress.</p>

<p>“What does it mane!” ejaculated the gallant
officer; “why, just this, me frind&mdash;that I’m no more
a woman than ye are yourself&mdash;but it’s Capthain
O’Bluntherbuss I am, of Bluntherbuss Park, ould
Ireland. The shiriff’s people are afther me&mdash;and I
’scaped ’em in this toggery. So now it’s your own
precious aid and assistance I want&mdash;and, be the
pow-r-rs! ye’ll not repint of any kindness ye may
show to a genthleman in timporary difficulties.”</p>

<p>Mr. Scales&mdash;for such was indeed the name of the
red-faced Brother whose hospitality and aid the captain
thus sought&mdash;now burst out laughing in good
earnest; and the gallant officer laughed too&mdash;for he
dared not show any ill-feeling on the score of his new
friend’s merriment. Besides, that very merriment
seemed to augur a willingness to render the assistance
demanded: and therefore the two laughed in concert
very heartily and for upwards of a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Scales’s mirth subsided into a low
chuckle, until it became altogether extinct so far as
its vocal expression was concerned;&mdash;and then he
enquired in what manner he could render his aid to
Captain O’Blunderbuss.</p>

<p>The gallant gentleman very frankly revealed to
him his real position: namely, that he had been compelled
to beat a precipitate retreat from his lodgings,
where he had left his cap, coat, waistcoat, and boots,&mdash;that
his breeches were at the tailor’s,&mdash;that he had
nothing on but his landlady’s garments, barring his
own shirt, stockings, and slippers,&mdash;that he had not a
penny in his pocket, nor indeed any pocket at all as
he then stood equipped,&mdash;and that he was most
anxious to get into the City, where he could obtain
funds in a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. Scales indulged in another laugh, and then
proceeded to comment on the statement which had
been made to him.</p>

<p>“I have got a couple of sovereigns in my pocket,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
he began, “and don’t mind advancing them for your
service if they will do any good.”</p>

<p>“Faith! and they’ll pay the landlady and the
tailor!” ejaculated the captain, quite delighted at
the prospect just held out.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Scales. “Then we can recover
your clothes for you. But how will it be if the
officers are in the house, and, seeing your landlady
give me the garments, should follow me?”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and Misthress Rudd is complately in my
power-r!” cried Captain O’Blunderbuss:&mdash;“just tell her
that if she don’t manage the thing slily for ye, that
I’ll split upon her and the Riverind Mr. Eminuel
Flummery&mdash;and she’ll turn as make and as mild as a
lamb. But I must be afther sinding her back her
own toggery.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a large band-box in my little bed-room
adjoining,” said Mr. Scales; “and I don’t mind carrying
out the gown and the bonnet and shawl in it.
Never do things by halves&mdash;that’s my motto. In the
meantime, you can put on my dressing-gown:&mdash;I am
sorry my own clothes would be much too small for
you&mdash;or else&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! be Jasus! and I’d sooner get back my own,”
cried the captain. “I niver should dar-r to prisint
myself in any other toggery to my frind in the City.”</p>

<p>“Well and good: you can step into my bed-room
and undress yourself,” said Mr. Scales; “and I’ll be
off as soon as you are ready.”</p>

<p>“And them ould fogeys down stairs in the yard,”
observed the captain,&mdash;“they’ll be afther quistioning
ye, my frind, about the tall lady in the black silk
gown that’s a foot and a half too shor-r-t for her.”</p>

<p>“Oh! leave them to me,” said the good-natured
Brother of the Charter House: “I’ll tell them it’s
my sister. Bless your soul, they’re all purblind, and
never will have noticed any thing peculiar in your
dress. It’s the nurses that I most fear&mdash;the charwomen
of the establishment, I mean;&mdash;for if any of
them saw you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I didn’t observe one of them, my dear frind,” interrupted
the captain. “But we’ve niver a ha’porth
of time to lose&mdash;and so I’ll be afther getting out of
this infer-r-nal silk gown and Lighorn bonnet.”</p>

<p>From the moderate-sized, but lofty and airy apartment
in which this colloquy took place, the captain
passed into a little chamber only just large enough to
contain a bed, a chest of drawers, and a toilette-table:
and there he speedily extricated himself from the
feminine apparel, all of which he thrust pell-mell into
the band-box which his friend had pointed out to him
for the purpose. He then wrapped himself in Mr.
Scales’s dressing-gown; and this being done, he gave
the good-natured Brother the necessary instructions
how to proceed with regard to the landlady and the
tailor.</p>

<p>Having tied a string round the band-box, so as to
carry it the more conveniently, and likewise with a
better appearance of negligent ease, Mr. Scales now set
out on his mission&mdash;previously enjoining the captain to
keep the door carefully locked until his return, and
mentioning a signal by which his knock at the door
might be known, so that the gallant officer should not
incur the danger of admitting any other person. The
moment the martial gentleman was left to himself, he
advanced straight up to the cupboard, which he unceremoniously
opened; and, to his huge delight, perceived
a bottle containing a fluid which was unmistakeably
of that alcoholic species so widely known under the
denomination of gin. The captain took a long draught
of the raw spirit, and, much refreshed, sate down to
await his new friend’s return.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed, during which he calculated
the chances of eventual escape from the bailiffs.</p>

<p>If they had not discovered the trick which was
played them, before the captain had entered the Charter
House, there was every prospect in his favour;
because he felt assured that Mrs. Rudd, even if she
had seen him take refuge there, would not dare to
betray him.</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, they had ascertained the
whole truth while he was as yet outside the Charter
House gates, then they had most probably rushed to
the windows and obtained a glimpse of his person in
the Square.</p>

<p>And yet, recurring to the chances that were favourable
to him, he reasoned that when the noise attendant
upon knocking down the methodist minister had
reached the ears of the officers, some time would then
be lost in receiving explanations from that reverend
gentleman, and in vain attempts to open the door&mdash;until
Mrs. Rudd’s return with the key; and in the
interim his place of concealment would have been
gained, and would remain unsuspected by the bailiffs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, once more, what if the officers
had not waited for Mrs. Rudd’s return at all, but had
leapt out of the ground-floor windows?</p>

<p>“Oh! bad luck to the pro and con!” ejaculated the
captain aloud. “I’m safe here&mdash;and that’s enough.
For if the spalpeens had suspicted that I <em>am</em> here,
they’d have been afther me long ago!”</p>

<p>Rising from his seat, he crept cautiously up to the
window and took a survey of the enclosures through
which he had passed a short time before; and this
reconnoitring process was highly satisfactory. The
old Brothers were lounging about as he had just now
beheld them; and not a shadow of a sheriff’s-officer
was to be seen.</p>

<p>Highly delighted by the hopeful assurances which
the aspect of things thus conveyed to his mind,
Captain O’Blunderbuss paid another visit to the
cupboard, and regaled himself with another refreshing
draught from the gin-bottle&mdash;after which potation, he
smacked his lips in approval of the alcoholic beverage,
and resumed his seat and his meditations.</p>

<p>The latter continued for another quarter of an
hour; at the expiration whereof the gallant gentleman
paid his respects a third time to the cupboard;
and scarcely had he closed the door of that commodious
recess, when the concerted signal was given, announcing
his friend’s return.</p>

<p>As Mr. Scales entered the room, a glance showed
the captain that his friend had succeeded in his
mission; for the red countenance wore a triumphant
smile, and the band-box had not come back empty.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and you’re a thrump!” exclaimed the
gallant Irishman, as he marked these indications of
success. “But what news of them bastes of the
airth&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re all safe, my dear fellow,” interrupted
Mr. Scales, wiping the perspiration off his rubicund
countenance. “The clothes are in the box&mdash;the
landlady is intimidated, and therefore in your interests&mdash;and
the bailiffs have got entirely on a wrong scent.
In fact, they had left the house before I got there:
but there’s no doubt they’re waiting about in the
neighbourhood&mdash;and therefore it will be better for you
to remain here until dark, if you possibly can. I
will give you a bit of dinner&mdash;and may be a glass of
grog&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>“Potheen&mdash;rale potheen!” ejaculated the captain,
viewing with supreme satisfaction the present prospect
of affairs.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;whiskey, if you prefer it,” said the obliging
Mr. Scales. “At all events we’ll have a jolly
afternoon of it, and drink to our better acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Betther acquaintance!” cried the Irishman, who,
in spite of his adventurous kind of existence, possessed
many of the truly generous qualities of his
much maligned and deeply injured fellow-countrymen;
“betther acquainted we can’t become, my
frind: for when a man has done all he could for
another, and that other a tothal stranger to him, I
mane to say it makes them inthimate at once. And,
be Jasus! Misther Scales, if ye’ve an inimy in the
whole wor-r-ld, tell me his name and give me his
address, and it’s Capthain O’Bluntherbuss that’ll be
afther paying him a morning visit, sinding up his
car-r-d, and then skinning him alive!”</p>

<p>Mr. Scales expressed his gratitude for these demonstrations
of friendship, but assured the gallant
gentleman that he had no enemy whom he wished
to undergo the process of flaying at that particular
time.</p>

<p>The captain now entered the little bed-room, and
hastily equipped himself in his own clothing&mdash;the
breeches, which the good-natured Brother had paid
for at the tailor’s, being neatly mended: so that the
Irishman speedily re-appeared in the semi-military
garb which became him rather more suitably than
the habiliments of Mrs. Rudd.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXLVIII">CHAPTER CXLVIII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE CHARTER HOUSE.</span></h2>

<p>Captain O’Blunderbuss, having made himself thus
far comfortable, wrote a note to Curtis, which Mr. Scales
despatched by a messenger to Mr. Bubbleton Styles’s
office in the City;&mdash;for the Irishman calculated that if
Curtis should return to the lodgings in Charterhouse
Square before the said note reached him, he would, on
hearing the adventures of the morning, retrace his way
to Crosby Hall Chambers&mdash;there to await either the
presence of the captain, or at least some communication
from him. This arrangement appeared to be far more
prudent than to trust Mrs. Rudd with either letter or
message announcing the place where the captain was
concealed.</p>

<p>The note being written, and the messenger despatched
with it, Mr. Scales proposed a luncheon of
bread and cheese and porter, as it was only eleven
o’clock in the forenoon, and he intended to order dinner
for half-past two. A “nurse,” as the charwoman
was called, making her appearance about this time,
the refreshments above mentioned were duly procured;
and Mr. Scales intimated to his attendant that he
should not dine in the common hall that day, but would
entertain his friend with steaks and potatoes in his
own apartment.</p>

<p>When the captain and the worthy Brother were again
alone together, they fell into a conversation upon the
establishment to which the latter belonged and in
which the former had found so hospitable a refuge.</p>

<p>“Ye seem to have a comfortable berth of it, my
frind,” observed the martial gentleman, after burying
his countenance for nearly a minute in a pewter-pot.</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is,” returned Mr. Scales, “I manage
to make myself happy, because I am naturally of a
gay and lively disposition, and I have a great many
friends who come to see me. Moreover, I have a few
pounds coming in from a snug little annuity&mdash;and
therefore I can afford those luxuries which the others
have no chance of obtaining. But if it weren’t for
these circumstances, captain,” added Mr. Scales, sinking
his voice to a mysterious whisper, “I should never
be able to endure the place.”</p>

<p>“Not endure the place!” repeated the captain, who
manifested unfeigned surprise at the observation. “Be
the holy poker-r-r! and it sames a broth of a place,
it does!”</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s all very well for people out of doors to
be told of the existence of the charity,” resumed the
Brother; “and how it gives an asylum to eighty poor
men, who are widowers and past fifty years of age:
but it’s the discipline, my dear sir&mdash;the interior discipline,&mdash;and
then the manner in which we are treated
by the authorities of the establishment!”</p>

<p>“Then there’s abuses in the Charter-r-r House as
well as elsewhere?” said the captain, interrogatively.
“Blood and thunther! where the divil aren’t there
abuses, if this same is the case?”</p>

<p>“No where, when the Church has any influence in
the matter,” returned Mr. Scales. “But I will explain
myself more fully. This institution, you must
know, was founded for the purpose of affording an
asylum to poor and deserving men, chiefly of the
literary or learned professions. But will you believe
it? There’s scarcely a literary man in the place; and
the only one of any repute at all is Mr. Valcrieff, the
celebrated dramatic author. The patrons put in their
old and worn-out butlers or lacqueys;&mdash;but this would
not matter, so long as worthy, deserving, and respectable
characters were nominated&mdash;which is not the
case&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you have some quare characters among ye,
I’ll be afther guessing?” exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>“We have indeed, my friend,” responded Mr. Scales;
“and that is what I chiefly complain of. For instance,
we’ve lately had a certain Colonel Tickner thrust upon
us&mdash;but who is no more a Colonel than I am. A short
time ago he called himself Major Tickner&mdash;and a little
while before that, he was Captain Tickner. So, you
perceive, he rises rapidly&mdash;and I have no doubt he
will be a General next week.”</p>

<p>“A Ginral, be Jasus!” cried Captain O’Blunderbuss.
“It’s thrue I might have been one myself by this
time, if I’d only stuck to the service: but I’ll swear
by the holy poker-r, that your Colonel Tickner is
nothing more nor less than an imposthor&mdash;a vile
imposthor,&mdash;and it’s meself that’ll unmask him.”</p>

<p>The gallant gentleman deemed it necessary to fly
into a passion relative to the pretences of the self-styled
Colonel Tickner to a high military rank; inasmuch
as such a display of indignation on his part at
the assumption of another, seemed to justify his own
right to the honourable grade of Captain.</p>

<p>“Well, it is shameful for men to pretend to be what
they are not,” observed Mr. Scales. “This Colonel
Tickner sometimes bores me with his company; and
it is not at all improbable that he may look in after
dinner. If so, we will have some rare fun with him.”</p>

<p>“If he dar-r-rs to have any of his impudence to me,”
cried the captain, looking particularly ferocious at the
moment, “I’ll trate him as I trated a French dhragoon
at Water-r-r-loo. ‘<em>Come hither, ye spalpeen, and let me
cut ye down to the middle!</em>’ says I.&mdash;‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, Monsieur</em>,’
says he; and on he comes with a rush.&mdash;‘<em>Blood and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
thunther!</em>’ says I, ‘<em>is it fighting ye mane, when I’ve
as good as taken ye prisoner before-hand?</em>’&mdash;and
griping him by the throat, I throttled him, sir, in less
time than ye’d be in tossing off a thimblefull of potheen.
But pray go on telling me about the Charter House,
my frind&mdash;and let’s hear all your little gravances.
Ye were spaking of the discipline of the place just now;&mdash;and
sure it’s meself that knows what discipline
ought to be.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear sir, the discipline of the Army and
that of the Church are two very different things,” said
Mr. Scales. “We’re eighty Poor Brothers in this
establishment; and every night the curfew rings&mdash;eighty
strokes of the bell! When one dies, there are
only seventy-nine strokes until the vacancy is filled
up;&mdash;and you may believe me when I tell you that
there is something horrid in sitting in one’s lonely
room of a dark wintry night, and counting the bell to
see whether a Brother has not died since we all met in
the common hall in the afternoon. For there are some
very, very old men here; and old men go off, you
know, like the snuff of a candle. Then, when one does
die, and we hear the bell stop at seventy-nine, it
sends the blood all cold and icelike to the heart&mdash;and
a shudder creeps over the frame, from head to foot,&mdash;for
there’s no saying whose turn it may be next. Ah!
captain, it may seem but a trifling thing to you&mdash;a
very trifling and paltry thing, this tolling of the
curfew-bell: but I can assure you that to us, who are
pent up here, it is no such trivial matter. For, in the
deep, deep silence of this cloistral building, the dreary,
dull, monotonous tolling of that bell suddenly arouses
the most painful thoughts,&mdash;thoughts of approaching
death, and coffins, and shrouds, and new-made graves,
and all the sombre ceremony of funerals. But to
hear that bell toll one <em>less</em>,&mdash;to know that a Brother
has succumbed to the icy hand of the destroyer&mdash;to
feel that there is a gap in our fraternity&mdash;a vacancy
in our association,&mdash;even though we may not have
loved&mdash;perhaps not even respected the individual who
is gone,&mdash;still to have forced open us, by the deep-toned
monitor, the conviction that he <em>is</em> gone,&mdash;this&mdash;this
is terrible in our cloistral loneliness!”</p>

<p>The captain made no observation; but he evidently
listened with profound attention;&mdash;and Mr. Scales,
warming in his subject, went <em>on</em>.</p>

<p>“I told you just now that I am naturally of a gay
and cheerful disposition, and that I can make myself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
happy under most circumstances. But when I am
alone here of an evening, and listen to the curfew-bell,
I&mdash;yes, <em>I</em> also am seized with a cold shuddering, and
my blood creeps with an ice-chill in my veins. And
if I hear the strokes stop at seventy-nine, it suddenly
appears to me that a shape, dim, shadowy, and
wrapped in a shroud, flits past me;&mdash;and I cast my
eyes around&mdash;almost dreading lest the pale and
ghastly spectre of the deceased Brother should be
standing behind my chair. And, when there <em>is</em> one
lying dead in the Charter House, I feel afraid at night&mdash;and
sleep visits not my pillow. I do not believe in
ghosts&mdash;at least, I do not believe in them when it is
day-time; but in the deep, silent, and dark night,&mdash;yes,
<em>then</em> I believe in them&mdash;and I tremble! Oh! you
can form no idea of the horrors endured in this place
while the curfew-bell tolls: for if it give forth a single
note less than the eighty, then every one shudderingly
says within himself&mdash;aye, and in the solitude of his
own chamber&mdash;‘<em>Who knows but that it may be my
turn next?</em>’ Is it not cruel, then, to maintain that
monastic custom of ringing the nightly bell,&mdash;to
alarm weak and trembling old men, whose intellects
are attenuated by the weight of years, and whose
imaginations are so susceptible of all influences likely
to engender the gloomiest forebodings: for such is the
case with the great majority of the Poor Brothers of
the Charter House.”</p>

<p>The captain made a brief remark to show that he
was listening with deep attention&mdash;as indeed he was;
and Mr. Scales proceeded in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;the greater portion of the Poor Brothers are
very infirm old men, who need companionship to enliven
them, and little attentions to cheer them, and
indulgences to render their existence tolerable. But
every morning,&mdash;summer and winter&mdash;hot or cold&mdash;sunshine
above, or snow knee-deep below,&mdash;they must
all turn out at an early hour from their warm beds;
and while still fasting, must repair to the chapel to
attend prayers. And in the performance of this duty,
which is rigidly enforced by fine, we are compelled to
wear long, dark cloaks, so that when thus muffled up
we appear to be a procession of monks, each wrapped
in his cowl! Here again you may observe that there
is no harm in the custom;&mdash;but you must remember
that there is a vast difference between what one does
spontaneously, and what he is forced by a rigid, inexorable
discipline to do. The fact that these poor old
men are thus compelled to wear the badge of monastic
pauperism is the iron that enters into their souls. They
have been compelled by their necessities to accept an
asylum in this place&mdash;and they feel that they are
treated as paupers. Their old age, which the world
without believes to be passing in a serene and tranquil
happiness here, unruffled by mundane cares, is rendered
miserable and wretched by a thousand little
vexatious points of discipline which make up an aggregate
sum of tremendous ecclesiastical oppression.
In the deep silence of the night&mdash;the awful silence
that reigns throughout this pile,&mdash;and in the solitude
of his gloomy apartment,&mdash;each of those poor old creatures
broods upon what he deems to be his wrongs;&mdash;and
you need not be surprised when I tell you that
they are often driven to the very verge of despair&mdash;or
to the threshold of madness! Ah! and it is not only
the curfew-bell&mdash;nor the compulsory attendance at
chapel&mdash;nor the long, dark cowls,&mdash;it is not all this
alone,” continued the Brother, now speaking with
solemn earnestness;&mdash;“but it is that we are watched
by spies&mdash;watched in all our movements within or
without the walls,&mdash;watched to be caught tripping, be
it never so lightly&mdash;in order that we may be punished&mdash;or
perhaps expelled, to make room for some one
whom the Master or any other authority is anxious to
provide for. The surgeon is a spy upon us&mdash;the
porter is a spy upon us&mdash;all the nurses are spies upon
us; and what is worse,” added Mr. Scales, now sinking
his voice to an ominous whisper, and bending his
head forward so as almost to reach the captain’s ear
with his lips,&mdash;“and what is worse,” he repeated, bitterly
but still in that low tone,&mdash;“we are spies upon
each other!”</p>

<p>Captain O’Blunderbuss started, and surveyed his
new friend with astonishment.</p>

<p>“I do not mean to say that I am a spy upon the rest,&mdash;nor
will I assert that we are all spies with regard to
each other,” resumed Mr. Scales: “but this I declare&mdash;that
there are many inmates of the place
who do enact the part of spies against their fellows.
Some wish to curry favour with the Master, Archdeacon
Hale&mdash;others carry their tittle-tattle to the
surgeon;&mdash;some gossip of their Brethren to the manciple,
or steward&mdash;others endeavour to worm themselves
into the good graces of even the cook;&mdash;and
all the nurses, with scarcely an exception, are the
spies of the matron. I tell you, sir, that there is a
monstrous system of supervision and <em>espionnage</em> in
existence within these walls;&mdash;and one Brother cannot
talk as a friend to another&mdash;because he is afraid
that he may be all the time making revelations to an
individual who will betray him! We have no confidence
in each other&mdash;we are all afraid of one another.
There is not such a thing as a good-natured chat and
harmless conversation in the Charter House. If you
make the most common-place observation upon things
the most indifferent, Brother Gray, or Brother Jones,
or Brother Jenkins will shake his head knowingly, as
if he saw something covert and mysteriously significant
at the bottom of the remark. But wherefore does such
a state of things prevail in the Charter House, you will
enquire;&mdash;and perhaps you will observe that if the
Brethren enact the part of spies upon each other, they
alone are to blame for making themselves miserable.
Pause, however&mdash;and reflect that it is all the fault of
the authorities. <em>They</em> encourage this contemptible
tittle-tattle&mdash;<em>they</em> show favour to the poor silly old
dotards who carry them tidings of all the complaints,
expressions of discontent, or occasional instances of
convivial excess which occur on the part of the rest.
These spies are favoured by the authorities: the others
know it, and become spies themselves;&mdash;and thus they
all spy upon each other, even as the Jesuits do in
obedience to the rules of their Order. Oh! the mean
and contemptible littleness of mind which such a state
of things engenders! I am sick&mdash;disgusted, Captain
O’Blunderbuss, when I think of it.”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and well you may be, my dear frind!”
cried the gallant gentleman. “But who is the governor,
d’ye say?”</p>

<p>“Archdeacon Hale is the Master, as he is called&mdash;Archdeacon
Hale, the notorious pluralist who fattens
upon the loaves and fishes of the Church, without ever
having done a single thing to render him deserving of
such fine preferment and such large emoluments. He
it is who presides over this Protestant monkery,&mdash;who
enforces in the nineteenth century the grinding discipline
of the sixteenth,&mdash;who moves the whole machinery
of <em>espionnage</em>, and rules us as a mitred abbot
was wont to sway his Romish brotherhood. If a
gentleman, reduced by adversity, once enters those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
walls as an inmate, he must resign himself to the treatment
of a pauper. The authorities look upon us in
that light; and the servants behave to us accordingly.
The very porter will sometimes call us by our Christian
or surnames, without the prefatory <em>Mister</em>. If the
surgeon visit us, it is evident that he considers
himself to be doing us a great favour&mdash;just as you
may suppose that the medical man belonging to an
Union of Parishes behaves towards the pauper invalids
requiring his services. Should the Matron have occasion
to call upon us, it is with all the airs of a fine
lady&mdash;she who curtseys and does not dare sit down
in the presence of the Archdeacon’s wife! The manciple,
or steward, is likewise a great man;&mdash;and woe
to the Poor Brother who does not receive <em>him</em> with
all possible respect. The nurses attend upon us in a
slovenly, negligent manner; and we dare not complain
nor remonstrate&mdash;for we know that they are
spies ready to report us for every incautious word that
we may utter, or even to <em>invent</em> charges against us.
It was but the other day that one of the inmates&mdash;a
poor old man of nearly seventy&mdash;<em>did</em> venture to complain
of the shameful neglect which he experienced at
the hands of his nurse. What was the consequence?
She made a counter-charge, to the effect that he had
taken liberties with her! The woman’s statement&mdash;her
unsupported statement was believed in preference
to the denial and the complaint of the old man, and
he was expelled the Charter House for six months&mdash;turned
out upon the wide world to live how he could,
or die as he might!<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Oh! you have no idea of the
tremendous tyranny that is perpetrated within these
walls, where all is so silent and all appears to be so
serene and tranquil! A short time ago a Brother,
driven to despair by the horrors of the place, went
away&mdash;took an obscure lodging&mdash;and put an end to
his life by means of poison. The authorities hushed
up the matter as well as they could&mdash;prevented the interference
of the Coroner&mdash;and had the man buried
within three days from the moment of his self-destruction.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
These are all facts, sir&mdash;stubborn facts; and
the public should know them. Yes&mdash;the public should
learn that there are eighty old men dwelling in a
monastic institution in the very heart of London&mdash;enduring
a discipline as severe, and subject to a system
as despotic and oppressive as in the olden times and
in those very cloistral establishments which Henry
the Eighth destroyed! The public should be informed
that then eighty old men are the victims of ecclesiastical
tyranny, and that they are compelled to
endure neglect and even insult at the hands of the
very servants who are so liberally paid to attend upon
them.”</p>

<p>“Be the power-r-s! it’s a bur-r-ning shame!” cried
Captain O’Blunderbuss: “and what’s worse of all, is
that it’s the parsons who are your governors and by
consequence your opprissors in this establisment. Bad
luck to ’em, say I!”</p>

<p>“A good parson is a most estimable, as well as a
most necessary character in society,” said Mr. Scales;
“and this every sensible man must admit. But an
intolerant, illiberal, tyrannical parson is the greatest
curse that can be inflicted upon a community. Such
is our case&mdash;such is our misfortune. We have half-a-dozen
parsons belonging to the institution; and their
main object is to get all the loaves and fishes to themselves.
Though they rule us with a rod of iron, they
do not mind breaking the regulations themselves.
For instance, if a Poor Brother remains away from
chapel without the surgeon’s leave, or returns home a
little after hours in the evening, he is reported and
fined&mdash;fined out of the beggarly pittance of seven
pounds ten shillings a quarter allowed him to purchase
tea, sugar, milk, and the many other necessaries which
the establishment does not supply. But though the
regulations specify in distinct terms that the Master
is to reside constantly upon the premises, he laughs at
the enactments, and passes weeks or months together
in the country. No fine&mdash;no punishment for him!
Who would dare to talk of calling the Very Reverend
Archdeacon Hale over the coals? But who does <em>not</em>
hesitate to kick Poor Brother Gray, or Poor Brother
Jones, or Poor Brother Scales from pillar to post,
and from post to pillar, if he be caught tripping in
the slightest degree?”</p>

<p>“Jist now, me frind,” exclaimed Captain O’Blunderbuss,
looking particularly fierce, “ye assured me
that ye hadn’t an inimy in the wor-r-ld: but it sames
pritty clare to me that I must be afther punching the
head of your Archdeacon&mdash;or manciple&mdash;or porter&mdash;or
some one, jist to revinge your wrongs and create a
little sinsation for the Poor Brothers, as ye call yourselves.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, do nothing mad or rash!” cried Mr.
Scales, positively believing at the moment that the
formidable Irishman was about to declare war against
the authorities of the institution, and that he would
experimentalise with his fists upon the first of those
functionaries who might chance to come in his way.
“All that I have been telling you is sacred between
you and me;&mdash;and as a man of honour, I must appeal
to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and if it’s to me honour-r-r ye appale,”
interrupted the captain, slapping his left breast
with the palm of his right hand, “I’ll not brathe a
wor-rd to a sowl that I’m acquainted with any gravances
at all, at all. But, remember, if the time
should come when ye may feel inclined to administher
a thrilling dhrubbing or so to any of thim spalpeens
of whom we’ve been talking&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” cried Mr. Scale?, suddenly: “some one is
ascending the stairs. Let us pretend to be speaking on
matters quite indifferent.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart!” said the captain: and,
elevating his voice for the behoof of the person who
was approaching the room from the stairs, he exclaimed,
“Yes&mdash;’tis a very fine mornin’, Misther
Scales&mdash;a very fine mornin’ indeed!”&mdash;just as if, in
the natural course of things, he would have made,
after a visit of nearly three hours, the remark with
which a conversation is usually commenced.</p>

<p>Mr. Scales burst out laughing at this display of his
new friend’s ingenuity; and the captain laughed
heartily likewise&mdash;though he knew not precisely at
what.</p>

<p>In the midst of this cachinnation, the door opened,
and the nurse, or charwoman, entered to lay the cloth
for dinner.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXLIX">CHAPTER CXLIX.<br />

<span class="medium">A STRANGE NARRATIVE.</span></h2>

<p>The nurse was a tall, middle-aged, powerfully-built
woman, with brawny arms, and a countenance that
indicated a slight affection for an occasional drop of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
“something short.” In fact, it was observed by the
Brethren on whom she waited, that she never looked
sulky when requested to repair to the public-house to
order any thing in the shape of beer or spirits; but if
entrusted with an errand of another kind&mdash;such as the
purchase of half a quire of writing-paper or a stick of
sealing-wax&mdash;it was a very great chance if she would
be seen any more until the next day. Her manners
were of the free-and-easy school; and she was accustomed
to address the Poor Brothers in a half-pitying,
half-patronising style, as if they were patients in a
hospital or in the infirmary of a debtors’ gaol. If
wearied, she would unhesitatingly seat herself without
being asked, and glide imperceptibly into a familiar
kind of discourse, while wiping the perspiration from
her rubicund face with her blue checked cotton apron;
and if it were in the cold weather, she would wait upon
her masters with a black bonnet, like an inverted
japan coal scuttle, on her head&mdash;the propriety of
leaving the tegumentary article in the passage outside,
never for a moment striking the ingenuous and
simple-minded creature.</p>

<p>If this excellent woman had any special failing,&mdash;besides
such little faults as drunkenness, inattention,
slovenliness, cool impudence, and deep hypocrisy,&mdash;it
was a propensity to gossip and a love of scandal. If
she were only carrying a pail down the stairs, and
met another nurse with a pail coming up the stairs,
they must both set down their pails on the landing,
and stop to have a quarter of an hour’s chat on the
affairs of their respective masters. Then one would
whisper how Poor Brother Smith was the meanest
skin-flint on the face of the earth; and the other
would declare that it was impossible for him to be
worse than Poor Brother Webb, who was always
complaining and yet never gave her even so much as
a drop of gin;&mdash;and in this manner the two women
would unburthen their minds, to the sad waste of their
time and the neglect of those whom they were well
paid to render comfortable. But Mrs. Pitkin&mdash;for
that was the name of the nurse who waited on Mr.
Scales and the other gentlemen living in the chambers
opening from the same staircase,&mdash;Mrs. Pitkin, we say,
was a more inveterate gossip than any other charwoman
in the place; and, as a matter of course, when
she had no trifling truths to retail or make much of,
she deliberately and coolly invented a pack of lies,
purporting to be the most recent sayings and doings
of her masters. The consequence was, that a great
deal of mischief resulted at times from these playful
exercises of Mrs. Pitkin’s imaginative qualities; and
more than one poor Brother was looked upon as an
habitual drunkard, or as a sad old fellow amongst the
women, without any other ground for the entertainment
of such an opinion than the mysterious whispers
of Mrs. Pitkin.</p>

<p>Well, it was this same Mrs. Pitkin who made her
appearance, as already described, to lay Mr. Scales’s
cloth and get the dinner ready.</p>

<p>“What o’clock is it, nurse?” asked Mr. Scales suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Only a little after two,” she replied: but scarcely
were the words uttered, when the Charter House bell
proclaimed the hour of three. “Well, I’m sure!” she
cried, affecting the profoundest astonishment; “I
never could have believed it were so late. Deary me!
deary me! But it’s all through that disagreeable
Mr. Yapp, who would have his cupboard washed out
this morning&mdash;though I told him it wasn’t near six
months since he had it done last.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;where have you put the potatoes to boil?”
demanded Mr. Scales.</p>

<p>“The taturs, sir? Lor, sir&mdash;did you order taturs?”
asked Mrs. Pitkin, now pretending to seem more astounded
than ever. “Well, I’m sure I thought as
how you said you’d have your chops without any
weggitables at all!”</p>

<p>“Chops!” repeated Mr. Scales, now waxing positively
wroth: “I ordered steaks&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Steeks!” cried the woman, holding up her hands
as if in amazement. “Why&mdash;how could I ever have
misunderstood you so? But it’s no matter&mdash;I can
just as well get steeks as chops; and one don’t take
much longer cooking than another.”</p>

<p>“Then, am I to understand that you have as yet
got neither chops nor steaks?” asked Mr. Scales, subduing
his anger as much as possible.</p>

<p>“Lor, sir! how could I go to the butcher’s when
there’s three of my masters is inwalids and dines in
their own rooms to-day? But I’ll be off at once&mdash;and
you shall have dinner in a jiffey, I can promise you!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the woman walked lazily out of the
room; and when the door was closed behind her, Mr.
Scales, turning to the captain, said; “Now you perceive
how we Poor Brothers are waited upon by these
nurses. You heard me give her specific orders to have
a steak and potatoes ready for us at two. She comes
in at three, and has totally forgotten all about the
dinner&mdash;for <em>that</em> is the English of it. And yet I dare
not complain against her: I dare not even speak
harshly to the woman’s face. But should you not
imagine that, after her neglectful conduct, she would
make all possible haste to get the meal ready? No
such thing! Look there,” continued Mr. Scales,
motioning Captain O’Blunderbuss to the window:
“she has fallen in with another nurse, and they are
stopping to have a gossip. Now they are going out
together; and before we shall see Mrs. Pitkin again,
she will have paid a tolerably long visit with her companion
to the bar of the Fox and Anchor.”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and shall I be afther her, my dear
frind?” demanded Captain O’Blunderbuss, rushing
towards the door.</p>

<p>“It is useless,” said Mr. Scales, holding him back:
“we must have patience. But do you see that old
man, standing apart from the rest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And laning on a stick?” cried the captain.</p>

<p>“The same,” returned the good-natured and communicative
Brother. “Observe how pensive&mdash;how
melancholy he seems! That is Brother Johnson&mdash;late
Alderman and once Lord Mayor of London.”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and I ricollict!” exclaimed the captain:
“’tis the hero of the Romford Bank affair.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” responded Mr. Scales. “And now
do you perceive that short, stout, elderly gentleman,
leaning on the arm of a friend from outside&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He walks as if he was blind,” interrupted the captain.</p>

<p>“And blind he unfortunately is,” said Mr. Scales:
“but not irremediably so. There is every prospect
that, with care and good medical advice, he will
recover his sight. He is a man who has made some
noise in the world&mdash;but with high honour to himself:
in a word, he is Valcrieff, the celebrated dramatic
author.”</p>

<p>“And a most rispictable-looking gintleman he is,”
observed the captain. “I’ve laughed many times at
his farces, and little thought I should iver have the
pleasure of seeing the writer-r himself, even at a disthance.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>“There is one inmate of this establishment,” said
Mr. Scales, quitting the window and returning to his
seat&mdash;an example followed by the gallant officer,&mdash;“there
is one inmate whose early history is very
peculiar; and the most extraordinary circumstance
connected with the matter is that he believes the
events of his younger days to be entirely unknown
and unsuspected within these walls. I should not
point him out to you, even were he amongst the
loungers in the court at this moment: neither shall I
mention his name&mdash;or rather the name by which he
is here known. But I may state that thirty years ago
I knew him by the name of Macpherson. We met in
Paris, shortly after the peace&mdash;and he was living,
with a beautiful French woman as his mistress, in
very handsome apartments. Her name was Augustine;
and she certainly was the most lovely creature I
ever saw in my life. Macpherson adored her; and
while he believed that she worshipped him in return,
her infidelity was notorious amongst all his friends.
He had succeeded to a small fortune, by the death of
an uncle; and, on visiting Paris, had fallen in with
this young lady, whose charms immediately enthralled
him. She was a banker’s cast-off mistress, and
was glad to ensnare a handsome English gentleman
in her meshes. Her extravagance was unbounded;
and in less than a year Macpherson’s resources
were completely exhausted. It would appear
that Augustine at that period introduced to him a
Frenchman whose real name was Legrand, but whom she
passed off as her brother. This Legrand was elegant
in manners and agreeable in conversation, as well
as handsome in person; but he was unprincipled,
dissipated, and of broken fortunes. From all I subsequently
learnt, and from the knowledge I had of Macpherson’s
character, I feel convinced that Legrand
made my English friend his dupe and victim; and that
Macpherson was entirely innocent of any intentional
complicity. Certain however it is that one morning
I was thunder-struck by the tidings that Macpherson
had been arrested on a charge of forgery. I hastened
to him in prison; and he declared most solemnly that
he was guiltless. It was true that he had negotiated
the instrument which was discovered to be fictitious:
but he assured me that Legrand had induced him to do
so. The examination before the Judge of Instruction
led to the arrest of Legrand; and it was confidently
hoped by Macpherson and his friends that the real
truth would transpire at the trial. But when the case
came on, Augustine&mdash;the faithless, treacherous, ungrateful
Augustine&mdash;gave such evidence as entirely to
exonerate Legrand and fix all the guilt upon Macpherson.
She committed perjury; but her tale was
believed,&mdash;for it was consistent, though false&mdash;delivered
with plausibility, though based on the most damnable
deceit. In fact, the vile woman sacrificed the Englishman
whom she had ruined and never loved, to the
French paramour whom she had passed off as her
brother; and Macpherson, being pronounced guilty,
was condemned to be exposed and branded upon a
scaffold on the Place de Gr&ecirc;ve, and to be afterwards
imprisoned for a period of five years at the galleys at
Brest. Myself and another English gentleman drew
up a memorial to the King, setting forth a variety of
circumstances in favour of Macpherson, and imploring
the royal mercy on behalf of our unhappy fellow-countryman.
Louis the Eighteenth referred the petition
to the Judges who had condemned Macpherson,
and as they stated that they had taken every thing
into consideration when they pronounced his punishment,
the Minister of Justice and Grace could not
hold out to the petitioners any hopes of a commutation
of the sentence. We had endeavoured to obtain the
remission of that portion of the sentence which condemned
Macpherson to be publicly exposed and marked
with a red hot iron&mdash;but, alas! this indignity could
not be spared the unhappy sufferer. Well, the fatal
morning arrived, when this dread public ceremony
was to take place. Macpherson rose early, and devoted
unusual care to his toilet. His countenance was ghastly
pale&mdash;his eyes were fixed,&mdash;his lips compressed. He
did all he could to appear calm, and endeavoured to
meet his punishment with firmness. But to be condemned
for an offence of which he was innocent;&mdash;to
see the fairest years of his youth destined to be passed
in a horrible state of servitude;&mdash;to know that he was
about to be branded with an infamous mark, which he
would carry with him to the grave,&mdash;all this must
have been beyond human endurance. Had he been
really guilty, his sufferings would not have been so
acute;&mdash;had he deserved his punishment, he would
have bowed to those destinies which he would have
thus prepared for himself. But he was innocent&mdash;innocent;
and the world did not know it:&mdash;only a few
faithful friends consoled him by the assurance that they
believed in his innocence. On the fatal morning which
was to consummate his disgrace, I visited him early;
but when I found him so apparently resigned and
calm, I did not offer those consolations which I would
otherwise have tendered, and which were all I had
now to offer.</p>

<p>“It was about eleven o’clock, in the forenoon,” continued
Mr. Scales, “when Macpherson was summoned
to the lobby of the prison. Two gendarmes were
waiting there to conduct him to the Place de Gr&ecirc;ve,
where he was to remain exposed for two hours, and
then be marked. He resigned himself to their custody,
and, accompanied by myself, proceeded towards
the great square where the hideous ceremony was to be
performed. Immense crowds were collected in all the
avenues leading to the Place, which was itself thronged
to excess. Two lines of soldiers kept a pathway clear
for the march of the prisoner up to the foot of the
scaffold. He did not cast his eyes downwards:&mdash;nor
did he glance to the right or to the left; but he kept
them fixed upon the scaffold towards which he was
advancing. He ascended the ladder with a firm step,
accompanied only by the gendarmes; for I was compelled
to remain below. The moment he appeared
upon the platform, a tremendous shout arose from the
thousands and thousands of spectators assembled to
witness his punishment; but no indignity of a violent
nature was offered to him. He cast a hurried and
anxious glance around: the whole square seemed literally
paved with human faces, which were continued
up every street communicating with the Gr&ecirc;ve, as far
as he could see. The quay behind him, the bridges,
the windows and roofs of all the houses, and even the
towers of N&ocirc;tre Dame and the parapet of the Hotel-de-Ville
were crowded with human countenances. Macpherson
remained exposed for two hours, seated upon
a chair on the scaffold, while the populace, with
hyena-yells and laughter, were contemplating him as
if he were a wild beast which they delighted to see,
but of which they were afraid. The idea, whether
this penalty were deserved or not, never entered the
head of one single individual in that vast multitude;&mdash;all
that they cared about was the man and his
punishment&mdash;and both were there! At the expiration
of the two hours, the crowd suddenly opened, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
public executioner, attended by his two sons, appeared
at the foot of the scaffold. One of the lads carried a
small iron pot, at the bottom of which there was a
grating: in this vessel was a bright fire of red hot
cinders and charcoal. The other boy carried an iron
implement in his hand. It was like a very small
shovel, with a tolerably long handle. The three
wretches ascended the ladder, and the shouts and the
hootings of the mob recommenced with increased
violence as the public functionary bowed jocosely to
Macpherson. A horrible laugh issued from those who
stood nearest, and who comprehended the fashion of
the executioner’s salute. This individual then arranged
his <em>paraphernalia</em> in a convenient manner. He placed
the brazier close to the convict’s chair, and put the
shovel-looking implement into the fire. He next proceeded
to inform Macpherson that he must take off
his coat and other vestments from his left shoulder.
The prisoner obeyed mechanically. He doffed his coat
and his waistcoat on the left side; and the executioner
instantly cut a large square piece out of his shirt, just
above the left shoulder-blade, immediately above the
curve of the shoulder. The most breathless suspense
now prevailed; and not a cry&mdash;not a murmur was heard
throughout the dense masses of people wedged together
around. ‘Take courage, my boy,’ said the executioner,
half ironically and half in pity; ‘it will only be the affair
of a few moments.’ I heard him make these remarks&mdash;for
I was close by the scaffold. He then proceeded to
strap the convict tightly down in his chair, confined his
arms and legs, and twisted the cords in such a manner
around his body and the back of the seat that he was
rendered as motionless and powerless as if he were a
statue. Ten minutes elapsed, and the thick part of
the iron was by that time red hot. This was the
crowning moment of the whole day’s amusement&mdash;an
amusement provided by the law that forbade bull-baits
and punishes cruelty to animals! The executioner
stooped down, seized the iron, and applied it to
Macpherson’s flesh&mdash;to that bare part which the square
cut out of the shirt had left exposed. The iron hissed on
the young man’s shoulder; and a fearful yell escaped
his lips. The iron remained upon the flesh for two or
three instants: the sufferer writhed in agony; but
only that one loud, long, and piercing cry escaped his
lips. The implement was withdrawn;&mdash;one of the
executioner’s sons placed a cup-full of water to the
convict’s lips, and thus saved him from fainting in the
chair. The cords were then unbound,&mdash;the young
man’s dress was adjusted,&mdash;and the gendarmes told
him that they were ready to convey him back to
prison. As he passed through the dense multitude
that had witnessed his punishment, he now hung
down his head&mdash;abashed and ashamed. Even had he
not felt the smart of the burn upon his back, the
knowledge that he was branded with the mark of infamy
would have been sufficient thus to humble and
subdue him. Women held up their children to gaze
upon him as he passed along;&mdash;he heard an old father
bid his son take warning from the example he had just
witnessed; and as he emerged from the crowd, and entered
a comparatively deserted street, on his way back
to prison, he caught the following words which were
uttered, with a laugh, by one spectator to another,&mdash;‘Oh!
there’s the man who has just been marked!’&mdash;‘Marked!
eh&mdash;and with a scar that he would carry
to his grave!’ thought I, shuddering from head to foot.
He returned to the prison of La Force; and the moment
he entered the lobby, he fell into my arms; for I
had walked by his side from the Place de Gr&ecirc;ve. The
courage of the man now failed him altogether; and he
burst into a violent passion of grief. The tears flowed
in torrents from his eyes; his breast heaved convulsively.
I endeavoured in vain to console him; and
then I thought it best to allow his agony to have full
vent, and he would feel relieved. The truth of this
opinion was speedily confirmed; and, when Macpherson
dried his tears, he exclaimed, ‘Now that the first
bitterness of my career of misery is over, I feel nerved
and resigned to encounter the ills which heaven has
in store for me.’&mdash;‘My dear friend,’ I said, ‘you must
yet hope for many happy years: the term of your
incarceration will soon pass away, and you will then
hasten to England, where friends will be prepared to
receive you with open arms, and enable you to forget
the sorrows that will then be over!’&mdash;‘Alas!’ he cried&mdash;and
the words still ring in my ears,&mdash;‘how can I
forget all this degradation and infamy? How can I
ever again appear in the great world, every member of
which will have read my trial, and many of whom
have this day seen me writhing beneath the hot iron
in the hands of the public executioner? Even supposing
my innocence be eventually proved, and that
all moral infamy be separated from my name, who
will remove the scar from my shoulder? who will
not remember that for five years I shall have herded
with the refuse of mankind? who will believe that,
even if guiltless I went to the galleys, uncontaminated
I have been released from them? What father will
entrust his daughter to the convict? what mother will
consent to the union of her child with a man who has
been publicly marked upon the scaffold? what brother
would allow his sister, pure and chaste, to link herself
to one whose outset in life has been so horribly characterised
as mine? And lastly, lastly,’ added he, sinking
his voice almost to a whisper, and clenching his fists
and grinding his teeth as he spoke,&mdash;‘and lastly, who
can remove the deep, deep scar from my heart, even
should there be a physician skilful enough to efface the
one upon my shoulder?’&mdash;I was then compelled to
take leave of him; and, on the following day, he was
removed to Bic&ecirc;tre, and lodged with the other convicts
who were about to travel the same road together. He
now found that his situation was wretched indeed.
Compelled to associate with men who had been guilty
of the most horrible crimes, and who gloried in their
infamy, his ears were offended with their obscene conversation
and their fearful blasphemies; and he was
ill-treated by his fellow prisoners, because he would
not laugh at their jokes or join in their revolting discourse.
If he threatened to complain, he was reviled
and mocked. But I shall hasten to the end of my
story&mdash;or at least to this part of it. The day for the
departure of the Chain of Galley-Slaves arrived; and I
took leave of my unfortunate friend. He was conducted
to Brest, where he worked on the port for a short
time; and then, on account of his good conduct, he
was made a clerk in the office of the Governor. This
was the last account I heard of him while he was at
the Galleys; for just at that period the death of a
distant relative called me to England, and the inheritance
of some property was accompanied with the condition
that I should change my name to that of the
individual whose fortune thus devolved upon me.</p>

<p>“Six years had passed,” continued Mr. Scales,&mdash;“six
years since the events which I have just related
to you, when accident enabled me to obtain a complete
assurance of that which I had all along fully believed,&mdash;namely,
the innocence of Macpherson respecting the
forgery. I was passing down Aldersgate Street late
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
one evening, when a sudden shower began to fall; and
I entered a gate-way for protection, having no umbrella
with me, and there being no hackney-coach stand
near. Almost immediately afterwards, a gentleman
in a cloak took refuge in the same place; but as I was
standing farther in the gate-way than he, and as it
was pitch dark there, we did not observe each other’s
countenance. Presently he stepped out into the
street to see if the rain continued; and I noticed that
he was accosted by a female, dressed in gaudy attire,
and who murmured something to him in French, to
which he did not however pay immediate attention.
But an exclamation from her lips&mdash;an exclamation of
surprise, which was instantly followed by the mention
of his name&mdash;aroused him from his reverie. He gazed
at the female who thus appeared to recognise him;
and, by the light of the adjacent lamp, the well-known
but somewhat altered countenance of Augustine was
revealed to him and myself at the same time. Amazement
rooted me to the spot, and compelled me to
become a listener. ‘What, Augustine!’ cried Macpherson&mdash;for
he it was: and all the while my presence
was unsuspected.&mdash;‘Yes, Augustine&mdash;that is my
name!’ said the young lady, somewhat flippantly,
‘But what are you doing in London?’ she asked
immediately afterwards, and in an altered tone.&mdash;‘How
can you ask me, Augustine, after my present
pursuits or my future prospects, when you were the
principal agent in consummating my ruin in Paris?’
demanded Macpherson. ‘Oh! you know not the
serious injury&mdash;the irreparable injury which you
have inflicted upon me. All my hopes, all my endeavours,
have one after another been defeated and
destroyed by the consequences of that fatal period.
My life is a series of misfortunes, of strugglings against
adversity, of ups and downs, of long intervals of
misery, with short and distant gleams of happiness;
and this career of sorrows and disappointments, was
prepared and marked out by the infernal schemes of
yourself and Legrand. Oh! inauspicious was the day
on which I first became acquainted with you and
the miscreant whom you represented to be your
brother?’&mdash;‘And will you believe me when I assure you
that I have never known a moment’s peace since the
fatal moment when I bore false evidence against you
in the French tribunal?’ exclaimed Augustine emphatically.
‘I was compelled to take that step, although
repugnant to my feelings; for I had not then lost all
principle,’ she added mournfully. ‘Legrand possessed
such power over me; and I also knew that he was as
capable of sacrificing me as well as yourself to his own
interests, if I did not fall into his views. That false
step on my part has reduced me to my present state
of degradation; I became reckless and ceased to sustain
even the appearance of respectability which I had
observed while I was living with you. Legrand was
killed in a quarrel at a gambling-house; and I then
became the mistress of&mdash;&mdash;.’&mdash;‘Oh! distract me not
with a catalogue of your vices, Augustine,’ exclaimed
Macpherson, interrupting her recital. ‘Can I sympathise
with you, who have caused my ruin? can I
commiserate with one whom, were I vindictive, I
should crush beneath my heel? Oh! could you
speak to me of the means of redeeming my character,
which is lost&mdash;innocent though I am, as well you
know,&mdash;could you give me back my peace of mind,
my self-respect, my confidence in myself, the esteem
and respect of men, and the enjoyment of an unsullied
name,&mdash;could you efface the mark from my shoulder,
Augustine, and wipe from my memory the dread impression
of the exposure in the Place de Gr&ecirc;ve with
the five long years’ sojourn at the galleys,&mdash;could you
do all this, Augustine, I would throw myself at your
feet, I would forgive you the wrongs I have endured,
I would almost worship you!’&mdash;‘There is something
which may yet be done,’ said Augustine, after a
long pause, ‘which would partially remedy the evil,
and which would at all events prove my contrition
for the part that I enacted in the matter.’&mdash;‘And
what is it that you propose?’ demanded Macpherson:
’to what do you allude?’&mdash;‘I would willingly make a
confession which would establish your innocence, and
so far retrieve your character in the eyes of the world,’
said Augustine.&mdash;‘But the world reviles me, and cries
shame upon me, without waiting to ask itself if I am
really guilty!’ returned Macpherson, bitterly.&mdash;‘The
thinking portion of the community,’ began the frail
woman earnestly, ‘will ever&mdash;&mdash;’.&mdash;‘That is a mere
idle phrase, Augustine,’ interrupted Macpherson.
‘There is no thinking portion, as a complete section,
of any community. Ask any individual singly and
alone, if he would scorn and shun a man who had
endured an infamous punishment, but who was innocent
of the crime attributed to him, and he would
launch forth into an eulogium of the liberality of his
own views, and indulge in a tirade against the narrow-mindedness
of his neighbours. He would say, “<em>Prove
your innocence, and I will be your friend.</em>” So would
reply every one whom you thus questioned individually.
But take all those persons together&mdash;assemble
them in one room&mdash;invite them all to a banquet&mdash;and
then introduce amongst them the man concerning
whom they had singly expressed so much liberality
of opinion; and collectively they would scorn&mdash;they
would shun him,&mdash;they would hunt him from their
company&mdash;they would expel him as if he were infected
with a pestilence! Where, then, is the thinking
portion of society? of what men is it composed? who
can separate the section from the mass? Talk no
more of proving my innocence, but let me now ask
you a question relative to your own position.’&mdash;‘My
position!’ repeated the young woman bitterly; ‘oh!
I feel its degradation so thoroughly, that it appears to
me as if every body must see and appreciate it also!
My shame clings to me, like a mass of dingy cobwebs
to a wall: I cannot shake it off; I cannot divest
myself of the sense of its utter loathsomeness; for if I
seek to brush it away with one hand, it clings to the
other. I dare not go to church to seek the comforts
of religion:&mdash;a prayer in my mouth would be pollution;&mdash;I
dare not even implore heaven to change my
condition, so thoroughly degraded am I in my own
estimation! And there are some of us&mdash;and when I
say of <em>us</em>, you will fully comprehend to what sad
sisterhood I belong&mdash;who are young, beautiful, and
even educated; and from their lips&mdash;their red and
inviting lips&mdash;issue imprecations and blasphemies at
all hours. But I am not so bad as that;&mdash;nor do I
drink as they do! God only knows, however, to
what abyss I may fall!’&mdash;With these words
the wretched creature hurried away in one direction,
while Macpherson slowly pursued his path
in another. I did not think it right to follow
him; for I fancied from the tenour of his bitter
outpourings to Augustine, that he wished to be forgotten
by the world, and pass as a stranger in the
mighty city. Well, years and years elapsed; and
misfortunes overtook me. I lost all my property save
a very small annuity&mdash;a mere pittance insufficient to
keep body and soul together;&mdash;and through the interest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
of a friend I obtained a berth in the Charter
House. To my surprise I found, on my entrance,
that Macpherson was already a Brother;&mdash;and thus,
after a separation of five-and-twenty years&mdash;for it is
five years ago that I came hither&mdash;our destinies cast
us into the same asylum. But, though I recognised
him, he knew not me. You must remember that I
had changed my name, and my personal appearance
had undergone an immense alteration; and therefore
it was not singular that he should fail to perceive in
me the friend who had consoled him in his misfortunes
at Paris in 1816. I have never revealed myself to
him within these walls&mdash;and never shall. It would
doubtless embitter his sorrowful existence were he
aware that his secret was known to a living soul in
the establishment which his necessities have compelled
him to make his home, and from which he will
remove to no other abode&mdash;save the tomb. Here,
then, we dwell&mdash;he brooding over the undying sorrow
that fills his heart,&mdash;I not daring to call him friend
and console him.”</p>

<p>At this moment the clock struck four, an hour had
elapsed since Mrs. Pitkin had departed with a promise
to return “in a jiffey;”&mdash;and she now reappeared, her
countenance much flushed, and her breath exhaling
the strongest perfume of the juniper berry.</p>

<p>She however had her excuse: the matron had sent
for her on particular business!</p>

<p>“If so, it must have been at the Fox and Anchor,”
muttered Mr. Scales: but perceiving that she had
brought up a cooked steak in a covered dish, he suffered
himself to be appeased by the prospect of dinner;&mdash;and
it was agreed both by himself and the
captain to dispense with potatoes, Mrs. Pitkin having
again quite forgotten that they were ordered.</p>

<p>The repast was now served up; and it must be
taken as a proof of contrition for previous neglect on
the part of the worthy woman, that when she sallied
forth for the beer and spirits she only remained a short
half-hour away&mdash;it being usually calculated in the
Charter House that a commission which one might
perform for himself in five minutes, occupies a nurse
exactly fifty-five to accomplish.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Scales and the captain were enabled to
make themselves comfortable; and when the dinner-things
were cleared away, hot-water was speedily
procured by the aid of a batchelor’s kettle. The
poteen was first-rate;&mdash;the two gentlemen were in
excellent spirits; and the hilarity of the evening was
soon increased by the arrival of Mr. Frank Curtis,
who had duly received his friend’s letter at Mr.
Bubbleton Styles’s office in the City.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CL">CHAPTER CL.<br />

<span class="medium">THE COLONEL AND THE CAPTAIN.</span></h2>

<p>The captain related to Frank all the numerous and
varied incidents which had occurred during the forenoon
of that eventful day; and the listener not unfrequently
burst into shouts of laughter, as the
gallant gentleman described the most ludicrous part
of his adventures&mdash;we mean the little episode of the
escape from the sheriff’s-officers in Mrs. Rudd’s garments.</p>

<p>Frank, in his turn, gave his gallant friend a hurried
but significant intimation that Mr. Bubbleton Styles
had “come down” with ten sovereigns&mdash;a figure of
speech implying that the City gentleman had advanced
that amount for the special behoof of Captain
O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Curtis.</p>

<p>The first use the Irishman made of this subsidy,
was then and there&mdash;fairly and cheerfully&mdash;to refund
to Mr. Scales the monies advanced by the worthy
Brother in the morning; and this little arrangement
increased the good feelings of that gentleman towards
his new friends, and enhanced the harmony of the
evening.</p>

<p>By degrees, as the good liquor produced its exhilarating
effect, the captain began to talk magniloquently
of his Irish estates, “which were unfor-rtunately
locked up in Chancery,”&mdash;Mr. Curtis told a great many
wonderful stories of his intimacy with Princesses and
Duchesses, “when he was in France,”&mdash;and Mr. Scales
related a number of interesting anecdotes connected
with the Charter House, and which had a signal advantage
over the narratives of his companions, inasmuch
as the former were all true, and the latter all
false.</p>

<p>In the midst of the conviviality a knock at the door
was heard; and on Mr. Scales exclaiming “Come in,”
the invitation was obeyed by a gentleman who was
immediately introduced to the captain and Frank
Curtis as Colonel Tickner.</p>

<p>The new-comer, who was an inmate of the Charter
House, was a man of middle height, and was much
older than he thought fit to appear to be; for by the
aid of false teeth, a handsome wig, and whiskers well
dyed, he was enabled to pass himself off as “just over
fifty”&mdash;whereas his years had certainly numbered a
good fifteen in addition to the amount specified. He
was well dressed, and had rather an imposing exterior:
but there was an unpleasant expression about
the eyes, and in the lines around the mouth, which
gave his countenance a sinister aspect, and denoted
low canning, duplicity, and artfulness.</p>

<p>“Sit down, colonel,” said Mr. Scales, when the
ceremony of introduction had taken place; “and mix
a glass for yourself. I told the captain you were sure
to come&mdash;and he was most anxious to see you; for I
know that military men are particularly fond of meeting
each other.”</p>

<p>This remark was made with a sly touch of satire,
Mr. Scales glancing the while at the captain, as much
as to say, “Now the ice is broken, and you can unmask
him;”&mdash;for as sincerely as the worthy Brother
did <em>not</em> believe Tickner to be a military man at all, so
in proportion was he convinced that O’Blunderbuss
<em>was</em>.</p>

<p>The colonel looked uneasy for a moment, while the
captain, whose natural impudence was increased by
his potations, put a bold face upon the matter, and
eyed Tickner with lurking ferocity.</p>

<p>“And pray, sir, in what rig’ment had you the
honour-r-r to ser-r-rve?” demanded the Irishman at
length, with a menacing reverberation of the ominous
r’s.</p>

<p>“Oh! in several,” returned the colonel, mixing his
toddy without raising his eyes. “Might I ask the
same question of you, captain?”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and ye may ask, sure enough, my
frind,” exclaimed O’Blunderbuss: “but it would be
more polite on your par-r-t if you was afther answering
my quaries first;&mdash;and thin it’s meself that’ll
give ye my whole pidigree from the beginning to the
ind of that same.”</p>

<p>“I should beg to observe, sir,” said the colonel,
stirring up his liquor, on which he still kept his eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
fixed, “that it would be more in accordance with the
rules of military etiquette if you were to give the first
explanations&mdash;seeing that I have the honour to hold a
higher rank than yourself in her Majesty’s service.”</p>

<div id="i_169" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“And, be the holy poker-r!” ejaculated Captain
O’Blunderbuss, flying into a passion: “that remains
to be proved! There’s many a discharged cor-r-poral
that dubs himself colonel, to my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“And there’s many a discharged cad to an omnibus
that calls himself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Colonel Tickner suddenly stopped short: for
Captain O’Blunderbuss started from his seat, and,
grasping the poker, exclaimed, “Be this holy insthrument,
I shall be afther daling ye a gintle tap on the
head, my frind, if ye dar-r to utther a wor-r-rd derogatory
to my honour-r-r!”</p>

<p>Colonel Tickner stared in ghastly silence at the
ferocious Irishman; and to add to the dismay of the
former, Frank Curtis, who relished the proceeding
hugely, whispered hastily in his ear, “For God’s sake,
don’t provoke him! He’s the most terrible duellist in
all London; he shot the Duke of Boulogne last year
in Paris!”</p>

<p>“I really&mdash;&mdash;did not&mdash;&mdash;in fact, it was very far
from my intentions&mdash;&mdash;” stammered the discomfited
colonel, casting a glance toward the door, to ascertain
if there were any possibility of escape: but, alas! <em>that</em>
was out of the question.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a mating, or the most abjict apology
will suffice!” vociferated Captain O’Blunderbuss, perceiving
that he had completely over-awed his antagonist.
“Frank, my frind, run over to our lodgings
and fetch my pisthols&mdash;in the box covered with green
baize, you know&mdash;and, be the power-rs! we’ll fight it
out across the table, each houlding the ind of a handkerchief:&mdash;that
is to say, with Mr. Scales’ lave and,
per-r-mission.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I shan’t interfere,” said the red-faced Brother
enjoying the scene as much as Mr. Frank Curtis, who
rose from his chair as if to depart for the purpose of
executing the little commission respecting the pistols.</p>

<p>“Really, gentlemen,” stammered Colonel Tickner,
glancing in bewilderment and dismay from one to the
other: “I&mdash;I am sure&mdash;I did not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Did ye mane to insult me?” demanded the captain,
brandishing the poker, while his aspect seemed
to acquire increased ferocity every moment.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;certainly not,” responded the colonel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
catching at the hope of extricating himself from the
deadly perils which appeared to hem him in around.</p>

<p>“And ye acknowledge yourself to be a liar and a
scounthrel?” vociferated the terrible Gorman O’Blunderbuss.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear sir&mdash;as for that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t ‘<em>dear sir-r</em>’ me!” interrupted the Irishman,
fiercely, “Acknowledge yourself to be a liar and a
scounthrel&mdash;and on my part I shall be ready to acknowledge
in retur-r-n that ye’ve made such an apology
as a gintleman ought under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;mutual concessions,” observed Frank
with a wink at Mr. Scales, who could scarcely keep,
his countenance through a violent inclination to laugh.</p>

<p>“A liar and a scounthrel!” repeated the captain, as
he advanced in a threatening manner towards the
wretched victim of this egregious bullyism.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear sir&mdash;if it will satisfy you&mdash;and, as
your friend observes, on the principle of mutual concessions&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Out with it, man!” roared the captain: “don’t
keep us waiting all day&mdash;for the hot wather is getting
could&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’d better not provoke him any more,” whispered
Frank: “or I shall be compelled to run and
fetch the pistols&mdash;unless you prefer having your brains
dashed out with the poker.”</p>

<p>“Oh! murder! ejaculated the miserable Tickner,
turning deadly pale at the awful alternative suggested:
“give me time to breathe, Captain O’Blunderbuss&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not a moment!” cried the ferocious gentleman
thus appealed to: “I must have complate satisfaction
before ye brathe another puff!”</p>

<p>“Well, then&mdash;I admit that I&mdash;I am&mdash;what you
said,” returned the colonel.</p>

<p>“Repate the words! A liar and a scounthrel!”</p>

<p>“A liar and&mdash;and&mdash;a scoundrel,” echoed the humbled
and trembling wretch, wishing that the floor
would open and swallow him up&mdash;or that any other
equally improbable casualty might occur, so long as
it should remove him from the presence of the ferocious
Irishman.</p>

<p>“Ye hear his wor-rds, my frinds?” cried the captain:
“he declar-rs himself to be a liar and a scounthrel.
And now, as a man of honour-r, I confiss myself
completely satisfied. The apology is most handsome&mdash;and
such as reflicts the highest credit on him as a
gintleman. Give me your hand, sir-r!”</p>

<p>The colonel diffidently extended the member thus
demanded; and the gallant Irishman shook it with
such hearty good will, that its owner winced and
writhed with the pain of the iron pressure.</p>

<p>“And now we’ll spake no more on milithary
matthers,” said Gorman O’Blunderbuss; “but dhrink
potheen at our aise, and converse on all kinds of
things.”</p>

<p>By this little arrangement the captain got rid of
the necessity of giving any explanation relative to his
own military career; and Colonel Tickner, speedily
forgetting the deep humiliation to which the bullying
character of the Irishman and his own craven spirit
had subjected him, paid his respects with so much
earnestness to the whiskey, that Frank was soon compelled
to sally forth and procure another bottle&mdash;Mrs.
Pitkin having returned to her own domicile under the
plea of being “very ill,” which in plain English meant
“very drunk.”</p>

<p>The conviviality was maintained until half-past
ten, when Captain O’Blunderbuss and Frank Curtis
rose to take their leave of Mr. Scales and the colonel.
But before they departed, the Irishman renewed his
expressions of gratitude and his protestations of friendship
to the worthy Brother who had manifested so
much kindness towards him;&mdash;and, highly delighted
with their evening’s entertainment, the two “inseparables”
walked off arm-in-arm together.</p>

<p>Now how gloomy&mdash;how truly monastic appeared
the Charter House, as they traversed the spacious
court, bounded by the low, uniform ranges of buildings.
Most of the windows were dark; but here and
there a flickering light was gleaming&mdash;feeble and
faint as the spirit of the old man for whose long lonely
hours even that poor candle was a species of companion.</p>

<p>In spite of the natural liveliness of the two friends’
dispositions&mdash;in spite of the whiskey they had imbibed&mdash;they
shuddered as the aspect of the place, in
the more than semi-obscurity of the starlight, seemed
cold and cheerless to the view,&mdash;aye, and struck so to
their very hearts.</p>

<p>Their footsteps raised echoes which sounded hollow
and gloomy, as if coming from the midst of tombs;
and if they paused for a moment, the silence was so
deep&mdash;so profound, it seemed impossible that the place
was in the very midst of the mightiest metropolis in
the world.</p>

<p>The feelings of the two friends were such, that they
could not have uttered a ribald word nor given vent to
a jest or a laugh, as they traversed an enclosure where
the stillness was so awful and the cloistral aspect of
the scene so coldly, sternly monastic.</p>

<p>Had their way lay through a vast cathedral, at the
silent midnight hour, they could not have experienced
a sense of more painful oppression; nor would a deeper
gloom have fallen upon their spirits.</p>

<p>It was a great relief when the porter closed the
wicket of the massive gates behind them;&mdash;and as
they hastily skirted Charterhouse Square&mdash;keeping a
good look-out for fear of unpleasant prowlers in that
region&mdash;the captain whispered to his companion,
“Well, Frank&mdash;and, be Jasus! I’d sooner be knocked
about the wor-r-ld as you and I are at times, me boy,
than take up my quar-r-ters altogether in that place.
It’s all very pritty, no doubt, while one has his frinds
with him; but whin they’re gone, Frank, it strikes me
that the loneliness becomes tin thousand times more
lonely.”</p>

<p>“I’m just of the same opinion, captain,” returned
Mr. Curtis. “And now where shall we put up for
the night?”</p>

<p>“Be the power-rs! and we’ve cash in our pockets&mdash;aad
it’s afther pathronising some tavern we’ll be
until the morning, whin we’ll take fresh lodgings,”
exclaimed the gallant gentleman, his naturally good
spirits reviving, as he found himself safe in Aldersgate
Street, and no suspicious-looking characters dodging
him in the rear.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLI">CHAPTER CLI.<br />

<span class="medium">THE CALM.&mdash;THE TEMPEST.</span></h2>

<p>Return we now to Charles Hatfield and Perdita.</p>

<p>The gorgeous lustre of a Parisian summer morning
streamed through the muslin curtains of a handsome
chamber in the hotel at which they had taken up their
abode: and the glory of that sun-light shone upon
the nuptial couch, where the newly-wedded pair still
slept.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>The night of bliss had passed; and, wearied with
love’s dalliance, they had fallen into a deep slumber,
the dreams of which were soft and voluptuous, and
gave no forewarning of a coming storm.</p>

<p>The long, luxuriant, deep brown hair of Perdita
flowed over the snowy whiteness of the pillow; and
the dark, thick, slightly curling fringes of the closed
eye-lids reposed on cheeks flashed with the ecstatic
nature of her visions.</p>

<p>A gentle smile played upon her moist lips of richest
red,&mdash;a smile that subdued the expression of resoluteness
which her countenance was wont to wear, and
gave an indescribable charm of serenity and sweetness
to features usually indicative of such strong
passions and such fierce desires.</p>

<p>But those passions were now lulled to rest: those
desires were for the time assuaged;&mdash;and happiness
filled the soul of the sleeping woman.</p>

<p>One fine, white, and robust arm lay outside the
coverlid: the other supported the head, or rather half
embraced the neck of her young and handsome husband.</p>

<p>The sunbeams seemed to kiss her flowing hair,&mdash;seemed
to play with the exquisitely modelled arm that
lay completely exposed,&mdash;seemed also to revel in the
treasures of her naked bosom, so firm, so rounded, and
so regularly heaving.</p>

<p>Sleep likewise sealed the eyes of Charles Hatfield:
smiles likewise played open his lips;&mdash;and his countenance
appeared a perfect specimen of god-like beauty
incarnate in man.</p>

<p>Yes: they were a handsome pair;&mdash;and so far there
was a remarkable fitness in their union&mdash;but in naught
beside!</p>

<p>In perfect happiness had they sunk into the profound
slumber which still enwrapped them;&mdash;for, on the one
side, Charles Hatfield had become possessed of that
woman of glorious loveliness who had enchanted&mdash;captivated&mdash;enthralled
his very soul;&mdash;and, on the
other, Perdita believed herself to have gained the title
of <em>Vicountess Marston</em> already, and to have that of
<em>Countess of Ellingham</em> in perspective.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock in the morning&mdash;the morning
succeeding the bridal night: and thus were the newly-wedded
pair still sleeping in the nuptial couch.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened, and Rosalie entered the
room,&mdash;Rosalie, naturally so gay, blythe, and full of
spirits&mdash;but now with a cloud upon her brow, and
evident anxiety in her manner.</p>

<p>Advancing towards the bed, she paused&mdash;gazed for a
few moments upon the sleepers&mdash;and murmured to herself
in French, “How handsome and how serenely happy
they appear to be! What a pity it is to awake them!”&mdash;then,
after another short pause, she said hurriedly,
“And yet it must be&mdash;for <em>the stranger</em> is imperative.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she touched Charles Hatfield gently
on the arm; and he woke up, with a start. But Rosalie
immediately put her finger to her lip to enjoin
silence; and the young man, now completely aroused,
surveyed her with mingled surprise and anger,&mdash;surprise
at her mysterious behaviour, and anger at her
intrusion.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she said, in a low but emphatic tone.
“A gentleman insists upon seeing you&mdash;and, as his
manner is so curious, I thought I had better awake
you <em>first</em>, sir,” she added, glancing significantly towards
her mistress, who still slept on.</p>

<p>“A gentleman!” repeated Charles, a suspicion&mdash;almost
a certainty of the real truth flashing to his mind:
“describe him!”&mdash;and he also spoke in a whisper,
though with emphasis.</p>

<p>Rosalie gave a hurried sketch of the individual who
so imperiously demanded an immediate interview with
her master; and Charles found that his conjecture was
correct&mdash;too correct, indeed!</p>

<p>“Go to him&mdash;and say that I shall be with him in
five minutes,” he observed, in a tone expressive of
deep vexation;&mdash;and Rosalie retired.</p>

<p>Charles immediately rose from the couch, but without
awaking Perdita; and, having hastily slipped on
some clothing, he proceeded to the sitting-room belonging
to the suite of apartments which he had hired
at the hotel.</p>

<p>He now found himself face to face with his father!</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield was pacing the parlour in an agitated
manner, when the young man entered;&mdash;his countenance
was very pale, and wore an expression of deep
care: indeed, Charles was shocked when his parent,
turning round to accost him, thus presented to his
view an aspect so profoundly wretched&mdash;so eloquently
woe-begone.</p>

<p>The young man, during the few minutes which had
intervened from the time that Rosalie quitted his bed-chamber
until the instant when he repaired to the
sitting-room, had nerved himself with all his energy&mdash;braced
himself with all his courage&mdash;mustered all
his resolution, to undergo what he knew must prove a
painful trial; for he expected accusations of disobedience
and ingratitude&mdash;reproaches for unmanly conduct
towards Lady Frances Ellingham,&mdash;in fine, a repetition
of those scenes which had bitterly occurred at the
Earl’s mansion in Pall Mall, and which, characterised
by so much misconception as they had been, had materially
tended to diminish the authority of the father
and the respect of the son.</p>

<p>Yes: he had made up his mind to bear upbraidings
and encounter the most painful remonstrances;&mdash;he
had even resolved to recriminate in the old style&mdash;reproaching
his father for the wrongs which he imagined
himself to have sustained at his hands relative
to the secrets attendant upon his birth and social
position. But when he beheld the expression of deep
care and the ashy pallor which sate upon that father’s
countenance, his rebellious heart softened&mdash;his stern
resolves gave way&mdash;his better feelings once more
stirred within him;&mdash;and all on a sudden it struck
him that there must be some reason for his parent’s
altered appearance, of a nature more grave&mdash;more serious,
than the mere grief which this runaway match
could possibly occasion.</p>

<p>The thought that evil had happened to his mother
flashed to his mind;&mdash;and in an instant all his imaginary
wrongs were forgotten.</p>

<p>“Father&mdash;dear father,” he exclaimed, in a tone of
earnest appeal; “keep me not in suspense! My
mother&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is as well, I hope, as under circumstances she can
possibly be,” interrupted Mr. Hatfield, in a hollow and
sombre tone.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” cried Charles, fervently.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you still love your mother?”
demanded Mr. Hatfield, whose countenance brightened
up in the faintest degree, but in a manner as sickly
as if the gleam of a dying lamp fell upon the rigid
features of a corpse.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you can ask me the question?”
exclaimed the young man. “Oh! you know that I
love my mother&mdash;my dear mother,” he repeated, as a
thousand proofs of her affection for him suddenly rose
up in his mind&mdash;rapidly as the spell of an enchanter
might cause flowers to appear upon the surface of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
stern and arid waste. “And you, my father,” he continued,
taking his parent’s hand, and pressing it to his
lips, “I love you also&mdash;in spite of what you may suppose
to be my disobedient conduct!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;you love me not!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield,
hastily withdrawing his hand which for a few
moments he had abandoned to his son: “else never
would you have acted thus. But tell me, Charles&mdash;tell
me,&mdash;for I did not condescend to question your
flippant French servant,&mdash;tell me&mdash;have I come too
late to save you?&mdash;are you married to that young
woman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you mean, father, whether Perdita Fitzhardinge
is now my wife,” began Charles, drawing himself up
proudly, and speaking in a resolute&mdash;almost indignant
tone,&mdash;“I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Perdita Fitzhardinge!” repeated the unhappy
man, staggering as if from a sudden blow dealt by an
invisible hand: “oh! then ’tis indeed she&mdash;and all my
worst fears are confirmed! Villiers was right&mdash;and
those officers were right also!”</p>

<p>“What mean you, father!” demanded Charles, now
seriously alarmed&mdash;though knowing not what to think.
“You speak of a young lady of ravishing beauty&mdash;elegant
manners&mdash;spotless character&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Charles Hatfield, is she your wife?” asked the
parent, now advancing close up to the young man,
and pressing his arm so violently with the strong spasm
which convulsed his fingers that Charles winced and
almost cried out through the pain inflicted; for his
arm felt as if it were grasped by fingers of iron!</p>

<p>“Yes, father&mdash;I am proud to inform you,” he said,
again assuming an air of noble independence,&mdash;“I am
proud to inform you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fool&mdash;madman&mdash;senseless idiot!” exclaimed Mr.
Hatfield, his rage suddenly bursting forth with such
volcanic fury that his son fell back in terror and
dismay and eyed his father as if he thought that <em>he</em>
must be insane: “you know not what you have
done&mdash;the misery, the wretchedness you have prepared
for yourself&mdash;the ashes you are heaping upon
your own head&mdash;the infamy and disgrace you have
brought down upon yourself and all connected with
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Father&mdash;father!” cried Charles, now becoming
full of wrath in his turn: “you exceed the license
which belongs to a parent even when the son is in his
nonage! Remember that you are alluding to the
marriage which I have thought fit to contract&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A marriage which will embitter the remainder of
your days, sir,” retorted Mr. Hatfield, turning sharply
round upon his son, and speaking with almost savage
rage.</p>

<p>“This is unworthy of you&mdash;and I shall hear no
more,” said Charles, in a haughty tone and with a
dignified manner, as he made for the door.</p>

<p>“Stop, sir!” cried Mr. Hatfield, rushing after him
and detaining him forcibly by the arm: “we may
not part thus&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Speak not evil, then, of my wife!” exclaimed
Charles, turning round, and darting on his sire a look
of superb defiance.</p>

<p>“Your wife!” repeated Mr. Hatfield, his manly
voice suddenly assuming the almost shrieking tone
of a wild hysterical laugh: “your wife!” he said,
now echoing his own words. “Oh! my God, that I
should hear you call that woman&mdash;that vile, profligate
woman, by the sacred name&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Father!” ejaculated Charles Hatfield, now goaded
to desperation, and raising his arm in a menacing
manner: “forbear&mdash;forbear, I say,” he continued in
a hoarse, thick voice,&mdash;“or, by the heaven above us!
I shall strike even <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“Listen&mdash;listen, Charles&mdash;for God’s sake, have
patience!” cried Mr. Hatfield, the thought now flashing
to his mind that in his ungovernable passion he
had dealt only in epithets and averments as yet unintelligible
to his son&mdash;whereas he should at once have
revealed facts, terrible and startling, crushing and
overwhelming though they might be.</p>

<p>“I will hear you, father,” said the young man, now
speaking in a tone of dogged sullenness “but again I
warn you not to provoke me beyond the power of
endurance.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;I will not anger you, my son,” rejoined
the unhappy parent, becoming comparatively calm
and even mournful in his manner and aspect; “for,
alas! I have tidings to reveal to you which will pierce
like a dagger to your heart’s core. The woman whom
you have wedded as your wife&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Again that contemptuous name of ‘<em>the woman</em>!’”
ejaculated Charles, fire flashing from his eyes.</p>

<p>“Patience!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield, firmly: “that
woman has deceived you&mdash;duped you&mdash;entangled you,
heaven alone knows how! to your utter undoing&mdash;for
she is the profligate and abandoned daughter of a
vile and tainted wretch&mdash;a returned transport!”</p>

<p>“’Tis false&mdash;false as hell!” thundered Charles, the
workings of his countenance rendering him, handsome
though he naturally was, hideous and horrible to
behold.</p>

<p>“’Tis true&mdash;’tis true!” cried Mr. Hatfield, as if
catching up the terrible emphasis with which his son
had spoken. “Perdita Slingsby&mdash;for that is her name&mdash;is
a wanton, beauteous though she may be: and it
was but two days ago that I accidentally heard the
full narrative of her profligacies in Sydney, from two
officers quartered at Dover.”</p>

<p>When the dreadful accusation that his wife was a
<em>wanton</em> had fallen upon the young man’s ears, his
boiling rage was on the point of bursting forth, with
all the violence of language and clenched fist, against
the author of his being: but when the allusion to the
officers at Dover immediately followed, the scene on
the Parade suddenly flashed to his memory, and a
faintness&mdash;a sensation of sickness came over him,&mdash;and
he staggered to a sofa, on which he sank as if
exhausted and overcome.</p>

<p>“Father&mdash;father,” he murmured, horrible suspicions
now rising up one after another, with lightning speed,
in his soul: “your words are terrible&mdash;they will kill
me! And yet,” he added, in a firmer tone,as a ray of
hope gleamed in upon his darkening thoughts,&mdash;“I
am a fool to believe this tale! No&mdash;no&mdash;it is impossible!
Perdita is pure and virtuous&mdash;and there is
some dreadful mistake in all this.”</p>

<p>But even as he uttered these words, a secret voice
seemed to whisper in his ears that he was only catching
at a straw, and that he was in reality drowning in
the ocean of truth which was pouring in with such
sweeping rapidity and overwhelming might upon him.</p>

<p>“There is no mistake, my son,” said Mr. Hatfield,
in a voice of profound melancholy. “Would to heaven
that there were!” he added, with such deep conviction
of the misery which his words implied, that all
hope perished suddenly in the breast of his son.
“You have become the prey to two designing women:
for I heard terrible things at Dover, I can assure you!
The officers to whom I ere now alluded, had recognised
Perdita leaning on your arm&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: I see it all now!” exclaimed Charles,
covering his face with his hands, and pressing his
fingers with almost frantic violence against his throbbing
brows.</p>

<p>“And those officers&mdash;with sorrow and grief do I tell
you all this&mdash;had themselves shared the favours of
Perdita in Sydney; and as for the mother of the
abandoned girl&mdash;know you what has become of her?”
suddenly demanded Mr. Hatfield.</p>

<p>“No: we missed her at Dover&mdash;just as we had embarked
on board the French steam-ship&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you are doomed to receive another dreadful
shock, my poor boy,” continued Mr. Hatfield, in a
tone of deep commiseration: “for Mrs. Slingsby&mdash;or
Mrs. Fitzhardinge&mdash;or whatever she calls herself&mdash;was
arrested at Dover, in consequence of a communication
made by electric telegraph from London&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Arrested!” cried Charles, his amazement for a
moment becoming stronger even than his deep&mdash;deep
grief.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;arrested on suspicion of being concerned in a
murder of an atrocious character at Pentonville!”
added Mr. Hatfield, in a solemn and impressive tone.</p>

<p>“Merciful God!” ejaculated the young man, clasping
his hands together as if in mortal agony: “surely I
have fallen in with fiends in female disguise. But
Perdita&mdash;Perdita,” he cried, the lingering remnants of
affection causing him to hope that he was destined to
hear nothing more terrible of <em>her</em> than the revelations
which had already crushed him as it were to the very
dust: “she at least, father, is unsuspected in this
dreadful affair?”</p>

<p>“The old woman who <em>is</em> suspected, and whose
countenance was seen by a witness as she issued from
the house of the murdered man,&mdash;that old woman, who
is no doubt Mrs. Slingsby, was accompanied by another
and younger female&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tell me no more, father!” almost yelled forth
Charles Hatfield, literally writhing on the sofa, as if
with the poignant anguish of a wound in a vital part.</p>

<p>“Compose yourself, my dear son&mdash;if it be possible,”
said the disconsolate parent: “for I have many other
things to tell you,&mdash;other dreams to destroy,&mdash;dreams
equally as bright as the hallucinations which you had
entertained relative to this wicked and hypocritical
Perdita. But first I ought to observe that there
appears to be no direct evidence to fix the murder of
Mr. Percival&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Percival!” repeated Charles, another and still
more dreadful pang shooting through his heart: “tell
me&mdash;Percival did you say?&mdash;Percival&mdash;a money-lender&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The same,” cried Mr. Hatfield: “for I last evening
read the entire account of the murder in an English
paper which I saw at the hotel where I have put up.”</p>

<p>“Then is the horrible surmise too true&mdash;too accurate,”
said Charles, in a hollow tone, while his face
grew ghastly once more; “and it must have been
these demons in female shape who caused his death.
But on what night, father,” he demanded with abrupt
impatience, “did the murder take place?”</p>

<p>“The night before you quitted London,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“Ah! then it is clear&mdash;clear&mdash;clear, beyond all
possibility of doubt!” exclaimed Charles. “Yes&mdash;it
was on the night in question that my note of hand
was discounted by that same Percival&mdash;for Perdita
has since told me that such was the name of the
money-lender,” he continued, in his soul-harrowing
musings.</p>

<p>“You have been raising money, then, Charles?”
said Mr. Hatfield. “But that is a miserable&mdash;a contemptible
trifle compared to all the rest! May I
however ask you on what security&mdash;or on what prospects&mdash;you
have obtained a loan and given a promissory
note?”</p>

<p>“Father, henceforth there must be no secrets
between us!” returned the young man, becoming
respectful, submissive, and even imploring in his tone
and demeanour. “The dreadful revelations of this
morning have destroyed all that egotistical confidence
in myself and my own wisdom&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, Charles,” interrupted Mr. Hatfield, taking his
son’s hand and speaking in a kind, commiserating
tone; “you have been too susceptible to first impressions&mdash;you
have formed hasty opinions&mdash;you have grasped
at shadows&mdash;you have revelled in delicious hopes and
pleasing aspirations, without ever pausing to reflect
that the very foundation-stone of all this castle-building
was a mere delusion.”</p>

<p>“I do not comprehend you, father,” said the young
man, now surveying his parent with profound surprise:
“unless, indeed, you allude to the destruction of all
the bright visions which I have conjured up respecting
the false&mdash;the wicked&mdash;the abandoned Perdita.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear son&mdash;I am now seeking to direct the
conversation into another channel,” responded Mr.
Hatfield, with solemn emphasis; “for, alas! I can too
well divine the deplorable error which you have adopted
and cherished as a substantial truth.”</p>

<p>“An error, father!” repeated Charles, still completely
mystified.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;an error of the most afflicting nature,&mdash;afflicting
to you&mdash;afflicting to me&mdash;afflicting to your
mother also,” added Mr. Hatfield, his voice becoming
low and melancholy. “In a word, Charles, you believe
yourself to be that which you are not&mdash;your ambition
has blinded you&mdash;your pride has led you into the most
fatal misconceptions&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Father, you allude to my birth!” exclaimed the
young man, starting as he spoke. “Oh! is there any
delusion in my recently formed opinions in that respect?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield rose&mdash;and paced the room for a few
moments: the whelming tide of recollections of the
past was now combined with that of the sorrows
of the present and the fears for the future;&mdash;and his
emotions were so powerful, that his voice was choked&mdash;his
faculty of speech was for the time suffocated by
ineffable feelings.</p>

<p>“Father&mdash;keep me not in suspense, I implore you!”
said Charles, rising from the sofa and accosting his
parent. “I am nerved <em>now</em> to hear any thing and
every thing, however terrible, in relation to myself!
Only keep me not in suspense, I beseech&mdash;I implore
you!”</p>

<p>“Alas! my dear boy,” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield,
turning towards him with tearful eyes,&mdash;“if I tell you
all connected with your birth&mdash;I&mdash;I shall unmask myself&mdash;I
shall stand revealed before you as a monster
whom you must henceforth loathe and detest.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” cried Charles, now throwing himself into
his father’s arms and embracing him tenderly: “for
the fatal difficulties&mdash;the cruel embarrassments, in
which I have plunged myself by my accursed folly&mdash;my
insane infatuation,&mdash;all these convince me that I
need a kind friend and adviser&mdash;and in you, my dearest
father, I shall find both!”</p>

<p>“Your language&mdash;your altered manner&mdash;your affection
determine me to throw myself upon your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
mercy, Charles,” said Mr. Hatfield, in a low and profoundly
mournful tone; “yes,&mdash;’tis the strange&mdash;the
unnatural spectacle of a father imploring a son to
forgive <em>him</em>&mdash;the father&mdash;the stain and the stigma
which mark that son’s birth!”</p>

<p>“Holy God! have I heard aright?” ejaculated
Charles, pressing his hand to his brow;&mdash;and, staggering
back, he sank on the sofa,&mdash;not in a swoon&mdash;not
in a state of insensibility,&mdash;but stunned and stupefied,
as it were&mdash;and yet retaining a maddening consciousness
of <em>all</em>!</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued his father, speaking in a sepulchral,
unearthly tone, and averting his head,&mdash;“you are,
alas! illegitimate, my dear boy; and the hopes&mdash;the
aspirations, which I <em>know</em> you have formed, are all
baseless visions!”</p>

<p>“And yet,” cried Charles, again starting suddenly
from his seat, “you assured me&mdash;emphatically assured
me, that my mother was pure&mdash;innocent&mdash;stainless;&mdash;and
it was this averment that led me, in connexion
with the discovery which I lately made of other great
secrets,&mdash;it was this declaration on your part, I say,
which led me to form those hopes&mdash;indulge in those
aspirations!”</p>

<p>“Oh! my God&mdash;it is now that I am to appear as a
monster in your eyes, Charles!” exclaimed the wretched
father, in a voice of bitter anguish: “and yet to guard
against all future misconceptions, since past ones have
wrought such deplorable mischief&mdash;I must reveal
every thing to you! Yes&mdash;your mother <em>was</em> stainless&mdash;<em>was</em>
pure&mdash;<em>was</em> innocent;&mdash;and I&mdash;villain, miscreant
that I was&mdash;I forcibly took from her that jewel of
chastity&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough&mdash;enough!” almost shrieked forth Charles
Hatfield, extending his hands imploringly: “utter not
another word&mdash;I understand you too well already!”</p>

<p>“And you have <em>read</em> the history of my past life,
Charles&mdash;is it not so?” asked the unhappy parent.
“Yes&mdash;yes: I know you have <em>read</em>&mdash;in the <cite>Annual
Register</cite>&mdash;the frightful narrative&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Father,” said the young man, rising, and grasping
the hands of his sire: “you must not blush in the presence
of your son! Once for all, let me state that I <em>do</em>
know every thing;&mdash;and now let the past&mdash;so far as it
regards yourself&mdash;be buried in oblivion. My impertinent
curiosity first led me to make those researches
into mysteries which I should never have sought to
penetrate;&mdash;and the knowledge I accidentally acquired,
led me to form hopes which have exercised a fatal influence
upon me! I discovered that you were the real
Earl of Ellingham; and, deeming myself to be your
legitimately born son, I conceived that you had
wronged me by keeping me in darkness in respect to
the title which I fancied to be my own,&mdash;in respect,
also, to the higher title to which I believed myself to
be the heir! Now&mdash;now, I can no longer blame you
for having observed so much mystery: Oh! no&mdash;on
the contrary, I have rewarded all your kindness towards
me, with the blackest ingratitude.”</p>

<p>“We will pardon and forgive each other,” said Mr.
Hatfield, solemnly: “you shall pardon and forgive me
for the stigma that attaches itself to your birth&mdash;you
shall likewise pardon me your mother’s wrongs, even
as she herself has long, long since pardoned me: and
I, on my part, will think no more of all that you have
lately done&mdash;save to extricate you from the cruel embarrassments
in which by your hasty conduct, your
imprudence, and your misconceptions, you have become
involved. In a word, I will be to you as a kind
friend and adviser;&mdash;and if henceforth I may not hope
for your affection&mdash;at least I may reckon upon your
gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;both, both!” cried Charles Hatfield, again
embracing his father tenderly. “Oh! how wicked&mdash;how
criminal I have been! A veil has fallen from
my eyes&mdash;my soul has lost its dogged obstinacy&mdash;and
I now perceive how ungrateful I have been to my
dear mother and yourself. But if it be not too late to
repair the past,” he continued, retreating a few paces,
and addressing his parent with a tone and manner of
solemn earnestness,&mdash;“if it be not too late to regain
my mother’s love and yours also,&mdash;oh! then the remainder
of my life shall be wholly and solely devoted
to that one object! Yes&mdash;I will reinstate myself in
your esteem&mdash;I will prove by years of affection and
obedience how bitter is my remorse and how sincere
is my repentance for the follies and indiscretions of
a few weeks! But in the meantime, father&mdash;in the
meantime, how am I to act towards the vile&mdash;the
guilty woman, whom I lately loved so madly?”</p>

<p>“Where is she at present?” demanded Mr. Hatfield,
profoundly touched by the contrition and altered
feelings now manifested by his son.</p>

<p>“I left her asleep in a chamber belonging to this
suite,” was the reply. “Oh! I dare not meet her
again&mdash;for I fear that I should spring upon her like a
tiger, and sacrifice her to my resentment! For all
my affection has now turned to a bitter&mdash;burning
hatred,&mdash;a hatred against herself and her more vile
mother; and I am astounded when I reflect how completely
I have been deluded by them. It appears to
me a dream&mdash;a vision! I can scarcely bring myself to
conceive that I could possibly have been so insensate&mdash;so
mad&mdash;so blind&mdash;so besotted! Oh! I could dash
my head against the wall, to punish myself for this
atrocious folly!”</p>

<p>And the young man struck his clenched fists forcibly
against his forehead.</p>

<p>“Compose yourself&mdash;in the name of God! compose
yourself,” said his parent, rushing in upon him and restraining
him from the commission of farther violence.
“Give not way to despair, my dear son&mdash;meet your
misfortune with courage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is easy thus to recommend patience and
endurance,” exclaimed Charles, bitterly: “but think
how cruelly I have been deceived! I was fascinated
as by the eyes of a serpent;&mdash;the magic of her charms,
the melody of her voice, the sophistry of her tongue,
and the excitement of her caresses, threw spells of an
irresistible nature upon me: I was enchanted&mdash;held
captive in silken chains&mdash;dazzled by the almost superhuman
beauty of that prodigy of deceit and wantonness!
I was not allowed time for reflection&mdash;suspicion
had no leisure to rise up in my bosom, much less
to fix its habitation there;&mdash;for I was whirled along,
as in a delirious dream, from the first instant that I
met that woman until the instant when your revelations
of this morning dispelled the entire illusion.
The artfulness of that designing creature sustained a
constant elysian excitement in my soul: a perpetual
succession of insidious wiles, of apparent proofs of
deep tenderness, and of caresses that would enthral
the heart of a saint,&mdash;such&mdash;such was the magic
course in which I was hurried madly along. Endowed
with a wondrous presence of mind, she had a
ready answer for every question that I put to her&mdash;even
to the explanation of her singular name;&mdash;and,
with a guile as profound as it was ravishing&mdash;with an
artfulness as deep as it was calculated to enchant and
captivate&mdash;she invested the history of her early days
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
with a mystery which only increased my admiration,
and made her appear more interesting in my eyes.”</p>

<p>“You cannot wonder, then, that you were so completely
deceived, my poor boy,” said Mr. Hatfield,
who had listened with great, though mournful interest
to the eloquent delineation of causes and effects which
the impassioned language of the young man had so
graphically shaped. “But as for the designing creature’s
name, I heard its origin from the officers whom
I met at Dover. She is called <em>Perdita</em>, or ‘The Lost
One,’ because she was born in Newgate&mdash;and her
mother, in the moment of repentance for her own
crimes, gave her that appellation as a memorial and a
warning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Heavens!” ejaculated Charles; “and I believed
the specious&mdash;the plausible explanation which the
artful girl gave me relative to her name! Oh! she
is made up of deceit: the world has never known her
equal in that respect. I have read of Circe, with her
spells&mdash;and of the Syrens, with their perilous allurements;&mdash;I
have read also of those Mermaids&mdash;with
the heads and busts of beauteous women, and with the
tails of monsters&mdash;and whose melting looks and ravishing
songs enticed sailors to their coasts, only to fall
victims to these unnatural devourers of human flesh:&mdash;but
all these wonders of heathen mythology are
surpassed by this modern Circe&mdash;this Syren of the
nineteenth century&mdash;this Mermaid who preys, not on
mortal flesh, but upon immortal souls!”</p>

<p>There was a terrible earnestness in the tone and
manner of Charles, as he gave utterance to these
words:&mdash;and his father perceived that the heart of
the young man was painfully lacerated by the conviction
of Perdita’s tremendous duplicity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” resumed Charles,&mdash;and Mr. Hatfield allowed
him to speak on, knowing that feelings so powerfully
excited as his had been and still were, must have a
proper vent, in order that the soul might regain something
approaching to the equilibrium of calmness:&mdash;“yes,”
exclaimed the young man, passionately,&mdash;“she,
whom I believed to be the mirror in which all excellent
qualities were reflected, is the embodiment of every possible
vice&mdash;every earthly iniquity. Oh! what a splendid
personification of <span class="smcap">Sin</span> would she make for the painter
or the architect! But it must be a bold pencil or a
powerful pen that could do justice to <em>her</em>,&mdash;aye, and a
man deeply read in the mysteries of human life, to
pourtray her character with accuracy! And that
character I can read now;&mdash;and I know her to be a
creature who has studied sensuality, with all the
ardour of a glowing temperament&mdash;with all the vivid
sensibility that could enhance the joys of amorous
enchantment! Oh! mine was an idolatry such as a
rapt enthusiasm pays, in its blind belief, to the Spirit
of Evil, conceiving it to be the source of every virtue!
Fatal mistake&mdash;deplorable error: shall I ever surmount
the terrible consequences?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;by taking courage, following my counsel,
and placing me in full possession of all the minutest
details of this distressing and perplexing case,” said
Mr. Hatfield, assuming the part of a comforter, now
that the indignation of his son had in some degree
expended itself in those passionate outpourings which
we have endeavoured to describe.</p>

<p>“Oh! fear not, my beloved father&mdash;my only friend,”
cried Charles, warmly,&mdash;“fear not that I shall now
conceal aught from you! I have obeyed the impulses
of my own wrongheadedness&mdash;and I am suffering
terribly in consequence: I have followed the dictates
of my own wilfulness&mdash;and I have gone lamentably
astray! The result is that I have no more confidence
in myself: from the pinnacle of that proud independence
which I sought to assume, I am dashed down into a
state of childish helplessness. If you abandon me&mdash;I
should not have courage even to attempt to extricate
myself from this maze of embarrassments in which I
am so cruelly involved: I should resign myself to my
fate&mdash;I should sink into despair!”</p>

<p>“Cheer up, my beloved son&mdash;and think not for a
moment of these dreadful alternatives,” said Mr. Hatfield:
“but answer me a few questions, and I shall
then know better how to act. Did you not find certain
papers in a secret recess in the Earl’s library&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and those papers are safe,” replied Charles:
“at least&mdash;Perdita has them secure in her writing-desk,
and we will make her surrender them presently.”</p>

<p>“As her husband&mdash;alas! that I should have to
speak of you as such,&mdash;you may break open that desk
and take them by force,” said Mr. Hatfield! “Does
the young woman know their contents?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately she does,” was the mournful answer.</p>

<p>“And her mother&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is equally well acquainted with them,” said
Charles. “Even to save you a pang,&mdash;and heaven
knows I would now do much to spare you any additional
uneasiness,&mdash;I will not deceive nor mislead you
in a single detail.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;this is not a time nor a case for trifling,
Charles,” observed Mr. Hatfield. “Then both these
women know who I am?” he added, in a low and
hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“Oh! my God!” cried Charles, giving vent to his
deep vexation and obeying the impulse of his self-accusing
spirit: “to what humiliations have I not
exposed you, my dearest father? <em>Can</em> you&mdash;<em>will</em> you
ever forgive me for all this?”</p>

<p>“Have we not had much to pardon&mdash;much to explain,
on either side, already?” asked Mr. Hatfield,
his voice now regaining its mildness&mdash;a mildness that
was, however, mournfully subdued. “Well, then, my
dear boy, give not way to these self-reproaches; for
if I be anxious to obtain a certain knowledge of the
full extent of these evils, it is only with the view of
falling into no error and committing no oversight in
extricating both yourself and me from the embarrassments
that surround us. To return, then, to the
immediate subject of our discourse&mdash;those women
know <em>all</em>?”</p>

<p>“All&mdash;every thing,” replied Charles. “In that
blind infatuation&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Compose yourself, my dear boy,” said Mr. Hatfield,
in a voice slightly indicative of paternal authority.
“Respecting the promissory note you gave the
money-lender Percival&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! now I shrink indeed from telling you the
truth,” interrupted Charles, his countenance glowing
with shame and confusion; “and yet&mdash;faithful to my
promise&mdash;I will not mislead you. The note of hand
to which you allude was signed&mdash;<em>Viscount Marston</em>!”</p>

<p>“If I recollect aright,” said Mr. Hatfield, “the
account of the murder, as reported in the newspapers,
states distinctly that no papers nor documents of any
kind were found in the victim’s house&mdash;the tin-box,
in which such things were probably kept, having been
emptied of its contents. The assassin or assassins,
then, whoever they may be, possessed themselves of
all the poor man’s papers&mdash;and your note doubtless
amongst the rest. In this case, we shall probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
never hear of it again. But&mdash;knowing the two women
as you do&mdash;can you believe that <em>they</em> were the
murderesses?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I cannot think it!” exclaimed Charles.
“What motive could they have had? Certainly not
to recover my promissory note, since they believed me
to be the heir to immense wealth;&mdash;and as they no
doubt fancied that their connexion with me would
place ample resources at their command, they were
not likely to peril their lives by killing the man for
the sake of the money which he might have had in
the house. Besides, when I saw them on the following
morning, there was no confusion&mdash;nothing on their
part to denote that they had so recently committed a
horrible crime; and, depraved&mdash;wicked&mdash;unscrupulous
as they evidently are, I cannot bring myself to imagine
that they could meet me with calm and unruffled
countenances, only a few hours after having accomplished
a midnight murder.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope that they are indeed innocent,” said
Mr. Hatfield solemnly. “And now I will explain to
you the manner in which I propose to deal with this
Perdita.”</p>

<p>The interest and attention of Charles redoubled, if
possible, as his father uttered these words.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven,” continued Mr. Hatfield, “I possess
wealth; and by means of gold, every thing can be
accomplished with such mercenary adventuresses as
these. Perdita shall receive a handsome sum of ready
money, and a suitable income allowed her so long as
she shall consent to dwell upon the continent, take
any other name than that which you have unfortunately
given her, and never more molest you.”</p>

<p>But scarcely had Mr. Hatfield uttered these words,&mdash;and
before his son had time to offer a single comment
upon the proposed plan to be adopted,&mdash;the door
opened, and Perdita entered the room.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLII">CHAPTER CLII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SON’S WIFE.</span></h2>

<p>The magnificent creature whom Mr. Hatfield now
beheld for the first time, had perhaps never shone to
greater advantage than on the present occasion.</p>

<p>She was absolutely dazzling&mdash;radiant&mdash;supernally
grand, in all the glory of her queen-like beauty.</p>

<p>A French cambric wrapper, worked, and trimmed
with costly lace, enveloped her form&mdash;fitting loosely,
yet defining all the rich contours of her voluptuous
shape;&mdash;and, though&mdash;having risen hurriedly almost
immediately after awakening&mdash;she had no stays on,
the natural firmness of her bust maintained its rounded
proportions without any artificial support.</p>

<p>We have before said that her early initiation in a
career of wantonness and the licentious course which
she had pursued in Australia, had marred nothing of
the first freshness of youth in respect to her;&mdash;and
thus, though her wrapper was so far open at the bosom
as to show that the glowing orbs of snowy whiteness
were unsustained by the usual article of apparel, their
contours were of virgin roundness.</p>

<p>Her dark brown hair had been hastily gathered up
in two massive bands, silken and glossy, and serving
as a frame to set off the height and width of the fine
forehead, which rose above brows arching majestically,
and almost meeting between the temples.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were slightly flushed with a carnation
hue;&mdash;her large grey eyes shone brilliantly, and appeared
to give a halo of light to her whole countenance;&mdash;her
moist red lips, parted with a smile of happiness
and satisfaction, revealed the teeth so perfectly regular
and of such pearly whiteness;&mdash;and her neck arched
proudly and with swan-like grace.</p>

<p>One arm hung negligently, but slightly rounded, by
her side: the other, thrown across her form just above
the waist, kept the folds of the wrapper together;&mdash;and
from beneath the skirt of that elegant, tasteful garment,
of almost gauzy lightness and transparency,
peeped forth the beautifully-modelled ankles in their
flesh-coloured silk stockings, and the charming feet in
their embroidered slippers of pale blue satin.</p>

<p>Though, as we have before stated, she was not above
the middle height, yet there was something truly regal
and commanding in her deportment&mdash;something more
than graceful and less than imperious in her carriage,
and, altogether, she appeared a being to whom it would
not be idolatrous to kneel.</p>

<p>On the contrary,&mdash;prejudiced and naturally inveterate
as he was against her, Mr. Hatfield could well
comprehend, even at the first glance which he threw
upon her, how a young man of enthusiastic disposition
and keen sensibility might love that enchanting creature
with a devotion amounting to a worship.</p>

<p>The apartment was large and beautifully furnished,&mdash;the
uncarpetted floor of oak was polished almost to
mirror-like brightness,&mdash;vast looking-glasses, set in
splendid frames, were suspended to the walls,&mdash;a massive
or-molu time-piece and handsome porcelain vases
filled with flowers freshly gathered that morning, stood
on the mantel,&mdash;and through the casements, which
reached from the ceiling to the floor, and which were
only partially shaded by muslin curtains, flowed the
gorgeous lustre of the cloudless sun, so that the room
seemed filled with a transparent and impalpable haze
of gold-dust.</p>

<p>Thus the whole aspect of that large and lofty apartment
was magnificent and rich, bright and joyous;&mdash;and,
had the minds of the father and son at the instant
been in a different mood, they would have felt thrilled
with admiration and delight at the presence of the
magnificent creature who now entered an atmosphere
so congenially glorious and sunny.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the beauteous being herself were surrounded
with a golden halo,&mdash;as if the perfume of the
freshly gathered flowers were the delicious fragrance
of her breath,&mdash;as if the delicate feet and ankles bore
her glancingly along a polished surface which she
scarcely appeared to touch; while the immense mirrors
multiplied the voluptuous form, as though other and
kindred houris were moving about in attendance on
their queen.</p>

<p>The effulgence of the warm sun played on her shining
hair, as if a glory sate on that exquisitely shaped
head,&mdash;gave additional brightness to the eyes that
flashed with the natural fire of joy,&mdash;and rendered the
fine and faultless countenance radiant and dazzling in
its surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>Were that a room in a palatial dwelling,&mdash;were it an
empress making her appearance,&mdash;and were the two
men courtiers awaiting her presence, the effect could
not have been more grand&mdash;more striking,&mdash;and the
courtiers would have fallen on their knees in mute
adoration of a being that seemed almost divine!</p>

<p>But, alas! circumstances marred all those fine effects
which the transcendant charms of a lovely woman
might have produced;&mdash;for the soul of this woman
corresponded not with her captivating exterior,&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
was dark and hideous&mdash;inspiring horrible thoughts,
and suggesting ideas of a nature so sinister, sombre, and
gloomy, as to throw into the shade all the glory of the
outward loveliness.</p>

<div id="i_177" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But, unsuspicious of the storm which was about to
explode against her, Perdita entered that room;&mdash;and
the influence of a night of love and voluptuousness
and of elysian dreams lingered upon her countenance
in the smile that it wore.</p>

<p>She had slept for nearly an hour after Charles Hatfield
had risen so noiselessly from her side in the
nuptial couch;&mdash;and when she at length awoke, she
imagined that her young husband had been unwilling
to disturb her when he himself arose. Nevertheless,
she determined to seek him ere she passed through the
routine of the toilette;&mdash;and hastily fastening up her
hair, and assuming a slight apparel, she had proceeded
to the sitting-room where she supposed him to be.</p>

<p>And there indeed he was: but not alone!</p>

<p>Still, when Perdita, on first entering the apartment,
beheld <em>another person</em> with him whom she sought,
she had no suspicion of the real truth, but imagined it
must be some friend who had found out her husband’s
residence in Paris and had perhaps called to congratulate
him on his bridal.</p>

<p>Thus was it that her countenance wore that delicious
expression of pleasure and satisfaction, as she
advanced towards Charles and <em>that other</em>;&mdash;and it
was not until she was within a few paces of them, that
she observed the foreboding looks which they cast
upon her&mdash;even the aversion and the hate with which
they <em>both</em> regarded her!</p>

<p>Then she stopped suddenly short, her countenance
undergoing an immediate change&mdash;the smile disappearing,
and giving place to an expression of proud
defiance and haughty contempt; though she was still
unconscious of the nature of the storm that she saw
lowering so ominously.</p>

<p>“Charles, who is this person?” she demanded, indicating
Mr. Hatfield with a movement of the head,
accompanied by a slight inflection of the whole form&mdash;a
gesture which would have become a queen.</p>

<p>“My father,” answered the young man quietly;&mdash;and
he turned away towards the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>For an instant Perdita seemed shocked by this announcement;&mdash;but
in the next moment, as the thought
swept across her brain that it was impossible for Mr.
Hatfield to know aught seriously detrimental to her
character, she crossed the room in a majestic manner,
and, laying her long tapered fingers gently upon her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
husband’s arm, said, “Is it possible that the remonstrances
of your father should have induced you to
repent of this alliance,&mdash;<em>you</em>, who have sworn to love
and cherish me in spite of parents and all the world
beside?”</p>

<p>“When a man discovers that he has taken a reptile
to his bosom,” said Charles, the words hissing through
his almost set teeth, “he flings it away from him.
He <em>ought</em> to crush it beneath his heel!”</p>

<p>The last sentence was added after a moment’s pause,
and ere Perdita, who was astounded at the tone, and
manner, and words of her husband, had regained the
power of utterance so as to enable her lips to shape a
comment or a reply.</p>

<p>“Is it to me that this insulting allusion applies?”
she demanded at length&mdash;her countenance becoming
ashy pale, and her lips quivering with the rage which
she still sought to subdue.</p>

<p>“It is to you that I addressed myself,” exclaimed
Charles, now turning round and confronting the
woman whom he had lately loved with such madness,
and whom he now loathed with such savage
aversion. “Vile&mdash;polluted&mdash;wanton thing,” he cried,
unabashed&mdash;undismayed by the lightning glances
that flashed from her wildly dilating orbs: “the
mask is torn from your face as the film from my
eyes&mdash;and I am no longer your dupe, though, alas!
I am perhaps still your victim! I know all&mdash;all&mdash;every
thing,&mdash;the depravity of your past life&mdash;the
hypocrisy of your present course:&mdash;all&mdash;all is now
revealed to me. Your evil fame has followed you
from beyond the seas;&mdash;it overtook you on the
Marine Parade at Dover;&mdash;and it now attaches itself
for ever to your steps, in the capital of France.
Oh! my God&mdash;how cruelly, how miserably have I
been deceived!”</p>

<p>And the young man darted a glance of savage
hatred upon the woman who, pale and motionless
as a marble statue, seemed petrified by the crushing
truths that fell upon her ears.</p>

<p>Meantime Mr. Hatfield stood aloof, with folded
arms&mdash;listening to the words that his son addressed
to Perdita, and marking their effect.</p>

<p>“That you were born in Newgate&mdash;of a woman
condemned to death for felony, and then reprieved,&mdash;<em>this</em>
was no fault of yours,” continued Charles,
in a slow and measured tone&mdash;for he sought as
much as possible to prevent a violent outburst of
the rage that boiled within him:&mdash;“that the mystic
name of <em>Perdita</em>, or ‘The Lost One,’ should have
proved prophetic of your after life, you also could
not help;&mdash;and that, amongst the felonry of New
South Wales, you should have become polluted&mdash;contaminated&mdash;and
indeed <em>lost</em>, was perhaps a fate
for which you are rather to be pitied than blamed.
But here all sympathy ceases for you! Wherefore,
on your arrival in England, did you seek <em>me</em> out to
become your victim?&mdash;wherefore did your wretched
mother dog my footsteps&mdash;accost me&mdash;ensnare me
into a discourse to which she imparted a mysterious
interest&mdash;and then lead me into your presence?
Why did you open the battery of all your meretricious
charms upon me?&mdash;why cast your spells
around me&mdash;wean my affections from an estimable
young lady who is white as snow compared with
the blackness of <em>your</em> soul&mdash;and lead me on until
the crowning act of ruin was accomplished yesterday
in the Chapel of the British Embassy?”</p>

<p>“I have heard you with patience&mdash;and if you
possess the generosity of a man and an Englishman,
you will give me an equal share of your attention,”
said Perdita, who, during her husband’s address,
had recovered all her wonted presence of mind&mdash;though
her heart was wounded in its very core.
“It is true that I was born in Newgate&mdash;that I
deceived you respecting the origin of my Christian
name&mdash;and that I escaped not the contamination
of a far-off clime into which my sad destinies threw
me. But when my mother, for reasons which I
think she made satisfactorily apparent to you,
sought an interview with you,&mdash;and when that
circumstance introduced us to each other, did you
not proffer me your friendship of your own accord?&mdash;did
you not next assure me that this sentiment
had changed to the feeling of love?&mdash;did you not
implore me, almost on your knees, to become your
wife at the altar&mdash;I, who in the first instance had
proposed and agreed to become your mistress only?
And then you dare to speak of our marriage as the
crowning act of you ruin,&mdash;that marriage on which
you yourself so imploringly&mdash;so earnestly&mdash;so
solemnly insisted?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;because I deemed you pure and virtuous!”
exclaimed Charles, almost gnashing his
teeth as the words of Perdita reminded him of
all the arts which she had practised to ensnare
him&mdash;all the sophistry she had used to make herself
appear in his eyes every thing that she was <em>not</em>.</p>

<p>“Was it to be supposed,” she asked, impatiently
and haughtily,&mdash;that shameless Perdita&mdash;“was it
to be supposed that I would reveal to you the incidents
of my past life? And yet, even if I had, I
do firmly and sincerely believe that you would still
have made me your wife!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;never, never!” cried Charles, his voice and
manner expressing loathing, abhorrence, and indignation.
“But let us not bandy words thus. I have
intelligence which&mdash;lost and depraved as you are,
and vilely as you have treated me&mdash;I nevertheless
grieve to have to convey to you,&mdash;for I cannot, even
in my anger and hate, forget that you are a woman.”</p>

<p>“And that intelligence?” demanded Perdita,
suffering not her countenance nor her manner to
betray the deep curiosity and the suspense which
her husband’s words had suddenly excited within
her bosom.</p>

<p>“The intelligence regards your mother, and explains
her mysterious disappearance at Dover,” continued
Charles, who, as well as his father, now intensely
watched the young woman’s countenance.</p>

<p>“Speak on!” she said, not a muscle of her face
betraying any emotion:&mdash;and still she stood motionless
and statue-like.</p>

<p>“Your mother was arrested on suspicion of being
concerned in the murder of Mr. Percival, the money-lender
whom you represented to me as the discounter
of my promissory note;”&mdash;and, as Charles
uttered these words in slow and measured tones, he
maintained his eyes fixed upon the pale but unchanging
features of his wife.</p>

<p>“Then my mother has been accused of that
whereof she is innocent,” said Perdita, in a voice
so firm and resolute, yet devoid of passion, that
her hearers felt convinced she was practising no
artifice now. “It is true that Percival discounted
your note: I myself received the money&mdash;and you
can doubtless give your father a satisfactory explanation
relative to the expenditure of the portion
that is gone. If Percival have indeed met his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
death by violent means, it was not by the hands of
two weak women that he fell.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven! <em>this</em> crime at least cannot, then,
be attributed to you,” said Charles. “There must
be enough upon your conscience without <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p>“And have <em>you</em> nothing wherewith to reproach
yourself?” demanded Perdita, still maintaining
that majesty of demeanour which, with her now
marble-like features, her motionless attitude, and
her fine form enveloped in drapery that fell in classic
plaits and graceful folds around her, gave her
the air of a statue of Diana the Huntress or of Juno
Queen of Heaven. “Have you inflicted no injury
upon me?” she asked. “Yes&mdash;yes: and I will
convince you that your conduct has been far from
blameless in that respect. You loved me&mdash;loved
me almost from the first instant that you beheld me.
Yours was not a tranquil&mdash;serene&mdash;and sickly sensation:
it was a fury&mdash;a wild passion&mdash;a delirium&mdash;a
species of hurricane of the strongest, most fervent
emotions. I was all&mdash;every thing to you:
parents&mdash;family&mdash;friends,&mdash;Oh! you cared for none
of these in comparison with me. The holiest ties
you would have broken&mdash;the most sacred bonds you
would have snapped&mdash;the most solemn obligations
you would have violated, sooner than have resigned
your hope of possessing me! All this is true&mdash;and
you know it. Your love amounted to a madness&mdash;a
frenzy, capable of the most unheard-of
sacrifices, and as likely to hurry you into the
most desperate extremes. For had I provoked
your jealousy, you would have murdered me: had I
fled and abandoned you, you would have pined
to death&mdash;or committed suicide. In fine, yours was
no common love&mdash;no ordinary affection. Poets
never dreamt and novelists never depicted a love so
boundless&mdash;so absorbing&mdash;so immense as yours.
And what could result from such a love as this!
The consequence was inevitable;&mdash;and that consequence
was that I, who had never loved before, received
into my soul a transfusion of the spirit that
animated <em>you</em>. You were so happy in your love,
that my imagination doubtless longed to revel in the
same paradise which you had created for yourself;&mdash;and
I was taught by you to love as profoundly and
as well. In a word, you ensnared my heart&mdash;you
obtained a hold upon my affections; and, as there is
a living God above us! I swear that when you led
me to the altar, you loved me not better than I loved
you. And this love which I experienced for you,
would have made me a good wife&mdash;a sincere friend&mdash;a
conscientious adviser. I should have entered
upon a new existence; and my soul would have become
purified. True it is that I gave to the marriage-bed
a body that was polluted and unchaste: but I
gave also a heart that was wholly and solely thine;&mdash;and
from the instant that our hands were united
by the minister of God, it would have proved as impossible
for me to have played the wanton with another
as that the infant child should harbour thoughts
of villainy and murder. Now you have learnt the
antecedents of my life&mdash;and your love is suddenly
changed into hatred. But did you not take me for
better or worse?&mdash;did you not wed me, because you
loved me!&mdash;did you not espouse me for myself alone!
Oh! you should pity me for the past&mdash;and cherish
me at present and for the future: and your conscience
tells you thus much even now!”</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield, who had listened with deep and
solemn interest,&mdash;for his soul was absolutely enchained
by this strange display of natural eloquence,&mdash;now
shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>“No! Then mark how fatal your love will have
proved to me,” exclaimed Perdita. “You cast me
off&mdash;you put me away from you;&mdash;and yet you cannot
give me back the heart which you have ensnared.
Wherefore&mdash;wherefore did you bring to bear upon
me the influence of your ardent love, unless you
were prepared to make every sacrifice unto the end?
I am young&mdash;I am beautiful&mdash;and I might gain a
high and a proud position by means of marriage:
but, no&mdash;I am chained to <em>you</em>&mdash;and <em>you</em> are intent
upon discarding me! Now reflect well on the probable
consequences of this proceeding on your part,”
continued Perdita, her melodious voice gathering
energy, and a tinge of rose-bud hue appearing on
her cheeks and gradually deepening into a flush,&mdash;while
her eyes shone with a lustre that gave an almost
unearthly radiance to her entire countenance:
“reflect well, I say,” she repeated, “on the probable
consequences of the resolution which you have taken.
As your wife, and dwelling with you as such, I should
have clung to you&mdash;loved you with unceasing devotion&mdash;exerted
all my powers to retain your esteem.
Nay, more&mdash;in time I should have won your good
opinion by my <em>actions</em>&mdash;as I had already secured it
by my <em>words</em>. Amongst the entire community of
women, there would have been none more exemplary
than I;&mdash;and thus your love would have proved a
saving influence&mdash;valuable to society at large, and
blessed by the Almighty Ruler whom you worship.
But how changed are these prospects! You are
prepared to discard me&mdash;to thrust me away from
your presence&mdash;to push me out into the great world,
where I must battle for myself. <em>There</em> I shall find
my circumstances terribly&mdash;-fearfully altered from
what they were before your lips whispered the delicious
but fatal tale of love in mine ears. For if I
retain your name, I thereby proclaim myself a divorced
wife: if I pass myself off as an unmarried
young lady, I shall not dare to accept proposals for
an alliance, be it never so advantageous&mdash;because
the fear of a prosecution for bigamy would hang over
my head. Will you, then, forgive me for the past,
and receive me as an affectionate wife and reformed
woman to your arms?&mdash;or will you send me forth,
an outcast&mdash;with ruined hopes, blighted prospects,
and a damaged character?”</p>

<p>Gradually, as she approached the end of this
speech, Perdita had suffered her voice to lose its
energy and its firmness, and grow tender, pathetic,
and mournful&mdash;until at the close of her appeal, it
became tremulously plaintive and profoundly touching,&mdash;while
her form simultaneously relaxed from
its statue-like rigidity&mdash;the head slightly inclining,
the body bending in the least degree forward, and
the hands joining as the last words fell from her lips.</p>

<p>For an instant Charles was about to yield to the
appeal commenced with a dignity so well assumed,
and terminated with a tenderness so well affected;
but, at the critical moment, Mr. Hatfield, who had
hitherto remained a mute spectator of this extraordinary
scene, stepped forward, exclaiming, “No&mdash;no;
a compromise of such a nature is impossible!
Charles, the sophistry is indeed most specious&mdash;but
the peril is likewise tremendous!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” cried the young man, instantly recovering
his presence of mind: “I told you, father,
that she was a Circe&mdash;a Syren,&mdash;and now you have
ample proofs of the assertion.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>While he was yet speaking, the appearance of
Perdita underwent a rapid and signal change. She
suddenly seemed to throw off the air of a suppliant,
as if she were discarding a mean garment that was
unbecoming and abhorrent: her cheeks acquired a
deeper flush, her eyes a more dazzling brilliancy;&mdash;the
blue veins in her forehead grew more clearly
traceable&mdash;her nostrils dilated&mdash;her lips wreathed
into an expression of sovereign disdain&mdash;and her entire
form appeared to expand into more majestic
proportions.</p>

<p>A moment before she had seemed a voluptuous
beauty, in the melting softness of an appeal for pardon
at love’s shrine: now she stood in the presence
of the father and son,&mdash;proud&mdash;haughty&mdash;and magnificent
as Juno,&mdash;and armed with authority to
wield the lightning-shafts and the thunderbolts of
Jove.</p>

<p>“Let us think of peace no more,” she exclaimed:
“but war&mdash;terrible war,&mdash;war to the knife! Cast
me off&mdash;thrust me from you&mdash;denounce me as the
wanton Perdita&mdash;proclaim me to be born of a felon,
and to have first seen the light in Newgate,&mdash;do all
this if you will: I shall not the less remain your
wife, Charles&mdash;and, as your wife, I am ennobled,&mdash;I
bear the proud title of <em>Viscountess Marston</em>!”</p>

<p>“Miserable woman,” cried Mr. Hatfield: “you
deceive yourself&mdash;even as Charles has been by himself
deceived! For know that he is illegitimate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Tis false! you would delude&mdash;you would mislead
me!” exclaimed Perdita, who, in spite of the
tone of confidence in which she uttered these ejaculations,
was painfully affected by the revelation that
had elicited them.</p>

<p>“It is true&mdash;too true!” cried Charles, with a bitterness
that carried conviction to the mind of
Perdita.</p>

<p>“Then if I cannot proclaim myself to be Viscountess
Marston,” she said, concealing with a desperate
and painful effort the shock which she had
just experienced,&mdash;“I can still have my revenge
against you both;&mdash;for if <em>my</em> mother were a felon,
Charles, <em>your</em> father was the same&mdash;if <em>I</em> were born
in Newgate, the author of <em>your</em> being has passed
through the hands of the public executioner!”</p>

<p>“Fiend&mdash;wretch!” ejaculated the young man,
springing forward as if about to dash her on the
floor and trample her under foot.</p>

<p>But the hand of his father suddenly grasped him
as in an iron vice, and held him back; and all the
while Perdita had maintained her ground&mdash;shrinking
not a step, retreating not a pace.</p>

<p>“Coward!” she exclaimed, in a tone of ineffable
contempt, as she kept her eyes&mdash;her large, shining
grey eyes&mdash;fixed with disdain upon him whom she
had lately loved so fervently and so well.</p>

<p>“Charles&mdash;Charles,” said Mr. Hatfield, in an imploring
voice, as he held his son firmly by both
arms,&mdash;“merit not by your actions that infamous
woman’s reproaches. I was prepared for what she
dared to address to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear father, this is terrible!” murmured
the young man, who felt a faintness coming
over him, as the words which Perdita had spoken
concerning his parent still rang in his ears, and as
he observed the deadly pallor which had spread over
that parent’s countenance.</p>

<p>“Compose yourself, Charles,” said Mr. Hatfield,
conducting him to a seat: then, turning round and
accosting Perdita, he exclaimed, “Madam, let us
treat this most unpleasant affair as a purely business-matter:
in short, let us effect an arrangement
which may be proper and suitable for both parties&mdash;the
basis being the immediate separation of yourself
and my son.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I have no longer any objection to offer to
that proposal,” said Perdita; “for after his attempt
to strike me, I despise even more than I hate him.”</p>

<p>“And just now,” exclaimed the young man,
starting from his seat, “you declared that I possessed
your heart. Oh! I am rejoiced that you have
admitted your hatred towards me&mdash;because I have
thereby received another proof of your boundless
duplicity.”</p>

<p>Perdita smiled scornfully&mdash;but deigned no reply.</p>

<p>“Leave the affair in my hands, Charles,” said Mr.
Hatfield, in an authoritative tone: then, observing
with satisfaction that his son returned to his seat,
the father addressed himself once more to Perdita,
who remained standing near the mantel. “Madam,”
he continued, “you have already heard that the
bright hopes in which your husband had indulged,
and the golden visions which he had conjured up,
are all destroyed by the revelation which I have
this morning made to him,&mdash;the revelation of the
<em>one</em> fatal secret&mdash;his illegitimacy! Instead, then,
of being <em>Viscount Marston</em> at present and <em>Earl of
Ellingham</em> in perspective, he is still plain and simple
<em>Charles Hatfield</em>&mdash;and so he is likely to remain. By
consequence, you, madam, are <em>Mrs. Hatfield</em>&mdash;and
not <em>Viscountess Marston</em> now, nor with any chance
of becoming <em>Countess of Ellingham</em>. If you require
proofs of what I am now telling you, I can exhibit
them at once;&mdash;for, knowing beforehand the nature
of the delusions in which my son had cradled his
fancy, and the necessity of destroying them, I set
out on this journey provided with several papers of
importance. For instance,” continued Mr. Hatfield,
taking forth his pocket-book; “here is the certificate
of my marriage with Lady Georgiana Hatfield&mdash;and
you may at once perceive by the date how
impossible it is that our son could have been born in
wedlock.”</p>

<p>While thus speaking, Mr. Hatfield had sunk his
voice to the lowest audible whisper&mdash;so that Perdita
alone heard him: for the revelation he was
making was of a most painful nature, although
rendered imperatively necessary under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Perdita glanced rapidly over the certificate, and
bit her lip with a vexation she could no longer conceal;&mdash;for
that document effectually set at rest the
question of her husband’s legitimacy or illegitimacy;
and she indeed found that instead of gaining a noble
title by marriage, she had formed an alliance with
an obscure young man who was dependant on his
parents for even a morsel of bread.</p>

<p>“It now remains for you to decide whether you
choose to proclaim yourself, wherever you go, to be
the wife of Mr. Charles Hatfield;&mdash;or whether you
will think fit to resume your maiden name&mdash;or any
other that may suit your purposes&mdash;and maintain a
strict silence henceforth relative to this most unfortunate
alliance.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Mr. Hatfield;&mdash;and Perdita appeared
to be plunged in deep thought for a few minutes.</p>

<p>“And what are the conditions you annex to those
alternatives?” she asked at length, fixing her eyes,
which now shone with a subdued and sombre lustre,
in a penetrating manner upon Mr. Hatfield’s countenance&mdash;as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
if she would <em>there</em> read the reply to her
question even before his lips could frame it.</p>

<p>“If you proclaim yourself my son’s wife,” said he,
meeting her look firmly and speaking resolutely,
“I shall spare no expense in bringing the whole
transaction before the proper tribunals in England,
with the ultimate view of enabling him to obtain
a divorce; and in this case I should not allow you
one single farthing&mdash;no, not even to save you from
starvation.”</p>

<p>“And have you not reflected,” asked Perdita, in
a tone and with a gesture indicative of superb disdain,&mdash;“have
you not reflected that a judicial
investigation must inevitably lay bare all the tremendous
secrets connected with yourself and family?&mdash;for
you cannot suppose, that if you commence
the part of a persecutor against <em>me</em>, I shall evince
any forbearance towards <em>you</em>! No&mdash;it would be, as
I said just now, a terrible warfare&mdash;a warfare to
the very death,&mdash;and in which human ingenuity
would rack itself to discover and set in motion all
possible means of a fearful vengeance.”</p>

<p>“I have weighed all this,” said Mr. Hatfield,
calmly; “and I have resolved to dare exposure of
every kind&mdash;nay, to sacrifice myself, if necessary&mdash;in
order to save my son.”</p>

<p>“And now for the conditions annexed to the
second alternative?” said Perdita, maintaining a
remarkable coolness and self-possession, although
in the secret recesses of her soul she harboured the
conviction that the triumph was as yet on the other
side, and that she must end by accepting the best
terms she could obtain.</p>

<p>“If you will sign a paper, undertaking never to
represent yourself as my son’s wife,” said Mr. Hatfield,&mdash;“never
to molest him in any way&mdash;never to
return to England, but to fix your abode in some
continental state,&mdash;and lastly, that you will retain
inviolably secret not only the fact of this most inauspicious
marriage, but likewise all matters connected
with myself and family,&mdash;if you affix your
name to such a document,” continued Mr. Hatfield,
“I will immediately pay you the sum of one thousand
pounds, and I will allow you five hundred
pounds a year so long as the convention shall be
duly kept on your part.”</p>

<p>“And should you happen to die before me?” said
Perdita, her manner now being of that cold, passionless
nature which rendered it impossible for Mr.
Hatfield to conjecture what sort of an impression
his alternatives and their conditions had made upon
her mind: “for you must remember,” she added,
“that such an event is to be reckoned upon in the
common course of nature.”</p>

<p>“Granted,” was the prompt reply. “My will shall
contain a clause enjoining and empowering my executors
to continue the payment of your income,
from a fund especially sunk for the purpose, so long
as your conduct shall be in accordance with the
conditions stipulated.”</p>

<p>“And am I to understand that if I leave your son
unmolested, I shall remain unmolested also!” demanded
Perdita.</p>

<p>“I scarcely comprehend you,” said Mr. Hatfield,
evidently perplexed.</p>

<p>“I mean,” replied Perdita, in a slow and measured
tone, so that her words could not be misapprehended
nor their sense mistaken,&mdash;“I mean that if I go
forth into the world again as Miss Fitzhardinge, or
Miss Fitzgerald, or any other name I may choose to
take,&mdash;and if, receiving a suitable offer of marriage,
I contract such an alliance,&mdash;I mean, then, to ask
whether I may calculate upon acting thus with impunity
at your hands?”</p>

<p>“My God! what interest can I have to molest
you in any way?” cried Mr. Hatfield. “Would to
heaven that you could both of you sign a paper
effectually emancipating you from any claim on
each other in respect to this accursed&mdash;this miserable
marriage.”</p>

<p>“You are now speaking with unnecessary excitement,
sir, after having reproved your son for
the same fault&mdash;and also after having yourself proposed
to discuss this matter in a purely business-like
manner,” said Perdita, her lip curling slightly
with an expression of scornful triumph.</p>

<p>“True, madam,” observed Mr. Hatfield, who,
throughout this dialogue&mdash;since his son had remained
seated apart&mdash;had treated Perdita with a
perfect though frigid courtesy: “I was in error to
give way to any intemperance of tone or manner&mdash;and
I ask your pardon. You have now heard all
that I have to propose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And I accept the conditions,” she said. “Indeed,
I shall be happy for this scene to terminate as
speedily as possible.”</p>

<p>“A few minutes’ more will suffice, madam,” observed
Mr. Hatfield. “If you will have the kindness
to provide me with writing-materials, I shall
not be compelled to intrude on you much longer.”</p>

<p>Perdita bowed slightly: and quitted the room,&mdash;not
in haste&mdash;but with stately demeanour and
measured tread, as if she were merely a consenting
party to a business-transaction, and not a vanquished
one on whom conditions had been imposed.</p>

<p>The moment the door closed behind her, Mr.
Hatfield said to his son, “That woman is indeed a
prodigy of beauty, and a very demon at heart.
What an angelic creature would she have been
were she as pure and virtuous as she is lovely!”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear father,” returned Charles, who
appeared to be completely spirit-broken and overwhelmed
by the terrible occurrences and revelations
of this memorable morning,&mdash;“you can now comprehend,
perhaps,&mdash;at least to some extent,&mdash;the nature
of that infatuation which I experienced in respect
to this singular being. The world has never seen
her equal for beauty and for wickedness.”</p>

<p>“The sooner you are removed from the sphere of
her fatal influence, the better,” observed Mr. Hatfield.
“When she re-appears, do you quit the room,
and hasten as much as possible your preparations to
depart with <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“Fear not, my dear father,” responded Charles,
“that I shall, of my own accord, interpose any delay.
But the papers&mdash;she will surrender them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As a matter of course. You may have observed,”
added the parent, “that, in spite of her haughty
coldness, she was subdued and vanquished.”</p>

<p>At this instant the door opened, and Perdita returned,
bearing her writing-desk in her hands.</p>

<p>Her countenance, though flushed, and thus presenting
a striking contrast to its colourless appearance
some time before, gave no indication of the
nature of her feelings: impossible was it to judge
of the emotions that might occupy her bosom, by
that which is wont to be denominated the mirror of
the soul.</p>

<p>Her step was still measured and stately, while
her attitude was graceful; and, as she advanced towards
the table&mdash;passing through the golden flood
of lustre that filled the room&mdash;the waving of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
white drapes; gave an additional charm to the
undulating nature of her motion.</p>

<p>From beneath her richly fringed lids, while affecting
to keep her eyes half bent downward as if on
the rose-wood desk which she carried, she darted a
rapid glance at Mr. Hatfield&mdash;and then her look
dwelt the least thing more lingeringly on her husband,
who had risen from his seat and was leaning
on the mantel.</p>

<p>By a natural effect of curiosity,&mdash;perhaps also in
obedience to a last remaining particle of that immense
love which he had so lately borne her,&mdash;Charles
Hatfield likewise glanced towards her from
beneath his half-closed lids, and also while he
wished to appear as if fixing his gaze downward:&mdash;thus
their looks met&mdash;unavoidably met,&mdash;and the
blood rushed to the countenance of the young man,
as he felt overwhelmed with shame, and bitterly indignant
with himself, for having given way to this
momentary proof of weakness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a smile of triumph,&mdash;though
faint, and perceptible only to her husband&mdash;not to
his father, who saw not with eyes that had once
looked love towards <em>her</em>,&mdash;curled the rich red lips of
Perdita; and she thought within herself, “Even in
the bitterness of your hate, the power of my charms
revives a spark, albeit an evanescent one, of the fires
that were wont to burn within your breast in adoration
of me!”</p>

<p>All this dumb show&mdash;this mute expression of the
strangest, and yet the most natural feelings on either
side, occupied but a few moments;&mdash;and then, as
Perdita placed the desk upon the table, Charles
turned to quit the room.</p>

<p>“Here are writing materials, sir,” she said to Mr.
Hatfield, not choosing to appear to notice the departure
of her husband; for all the pride of this
extraordinary woman was aroused to a degree which
in a being of lesser energy would have been totally
incompatible with the frightful exposure that had
been made of her depravity and deceit.</p>

<p>But the consciousness of possessing the loveliness
of an Angel rose superior to the shame of being
proved to be endowed with the profligacy of a Demon:
the knowledge that she was so pre-eminently beautiful
was for her a triumph and a glory which, in
her estimation, threw into the shade the certainty
of her wantonness and guile;&mdash;she flattered herself
and fancied that, even were her true character revealed
in its proper colours to all the world, the
darkness of her soul would be absorbed and rendered
invisible by the transcendant brilliancy of her outward
charms.</p>

<p>Thus, even in the presence of the husband to
whom she was unmasked, and of the indignant
father who had unmasked her, the pride of her loveliness
enabled her to maintain that haughty demeanour
which we have explained;&mdash;for it was not
Perdita who was likely to melt into tears&mdash;to supplicate
for mercy&mdash;to acknowledge shame or remorse&mdash;or
to kneel to those whom she now looked upon
as her enemies. Unless, indeed, she had some grand
object to accomplish, or some important end to
gain;&mdash;and then she could veil her pride beneath
an assumption of all the passions&mdash;all the emotions&mdash;and
all the tender feelings which she might deem
it expedient to affect.</p>

<p>To return to the thread of our narrative.</p>

<p>“Here are writing materials, sir,” she remarked,
as she placed the desk upon the table: then, drawing
a chair near, she seated herself in a calm and
dignified manner, and with all the appearance of
one who knew and felt that she had important
business in hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield bowed&mdash;seated himself likewise&mdash;and
proceeded to draw up a document including the
conditions which he had already specified, and which
the lady had agreed to.</p>

<p>While he was writing, Perdita kept her eyes fixed
upon him, as if she could tell by the movement of
the pen the very words it was forming, as the hand
which held it travelled rapidly over the paper.</p>

<p>At length the document was finished; and Mr.
Hatfield presented it to Perdita for her perusal.
While she was engaged in reading it, he drew forth
his pocket-book, and counted thence ten notes, each
of a hundred pounds, upon the table.</p>

<p>“I have no objection to offer to this deed,” said
Perdita, taking up the pen to sign it.</p>

<p>“Here is the amount promised,” said Mr. Hatfield;
“and I will now give you an undertaking
relative to the payment of the income which I have
promised you.”</p>

<p>Perdita bowed coldly; and he immediately drew
up the second paper.</p>

<p>“I must now request you to give me up all the
<em>private documents</em> which my son placed in your
hands for safe keeping,” observed Mr. Hatfield.</p>

<p>“They are in the upper part of that desk&mdash;and
you can take them,” said Perdita, without the least
hesitation; for she was naturally prepared for this
demand, and had no object to serve in refusing it.</p>

<p>She then signed her undertaking, while Mr. Hatfield
possessed himself of the documents and looked
them carefully over to ascertain that none were missing.</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself on this head, he gave
Perdita the money and the undertaking which he
had prepared; and thus terminated this strange
business.</p>

<p>“I have now a few observations to make,” said
Perdita; “but they are not of a nature to revive
any unpleasant discussion. They concern matters
entirely personal to myself. Although I have declared&mdash;and
emphatically declare again&mdash;that my
mother is innocent of the crime on suspicion of
which you inform me that she has been arrested,
the judicial investigation will naturally lead to a
most unpleasant exposure of her <em>name</em>. It is therefore
probable that my interests and views may be
served by a change of <em>my name</em>&mdash;as I shall not of
course bear that which the marriage-ceremony of
yesterday gave to me. Should I adopt such a course,
I will acquaint you by letter with the fact&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” said
Mr. Hatfield; “but I shall seek not to become acquainted
with any particulars that may hereafter
concern you. Every quarter you can draw upon
me, through any banker, in any part of the world
where you may happen to be; and you are at liberty
to use any name you may think fit&mdash;save <em>one</em>. I
shall know that the draft is yours; and you may
rest assured that it will be duly honoured.”</p>

<p>“Then we have now no more to say to each other,”
observed Perdita, rising from her seat, and mechanically
drawing the muslin wrapper around her, in
such a manner that it displayed all the full proportions
of her fine figure.</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield bowed a negative,&mdash;then immediately
added, “But perhaps you will have no objection,
madam, to remain here until my son shall have
made his preparations for departure?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p>“Oh! certainly.” cried the young woman, her
lip curling haughtily. “Think not, sir, that I shall
condescend to use any arts in order to win him back
to me;&mdash;although well aware am I that if I chose
to do so, I should speedily behold him languishing
at my feet.”</p>

<p>Scarcely were these words uttered, when Rosalie
entered the room, and addressing herself to Mr.
Hatfield, said, “My master, sir, is waiting for you
below.”</p>

<p>The abigail, who was evidently at a loss to comprehend
the nature of all that was going on,&mdash;though
she saw enough to convince her that something
very uncommon and unusual was taking place,&mdash;retired
as soon as she had delivered this message;&mdash;and
Mr. Hatfield, as he glanced towards Perdita
while bowing to take his leave, observed that her
countenance had again grown marble-like with
pallor.</p>

<p>For now that the conviction that Charles was really
gone was forced upon her mind, a pang of regret
struck to her heart,&mdash;regret to lose one&mdash;<em>the first</em>&mdash;whom
she had ever really loved;&mdash;and for a few
instants she felt as if all her affection for him had
suddenly revived with tenfold violence.</p>

<p>But this weakness on her part was speedily dissipated:
her pride resumed its empire,&mdash;and she
remembered likewise that her connexion with him
had not only put her in possession of a large sum
of ready money, but had likewise assured her of a
handsome annual income for the remainder of her
days.</p>

<p>Thus, almost before Mr. Hatfield had reached the
room-door, the colour had returned to her cheeks,&mdash;and
her countenance became radiant with triumph,&mdash;for
she murmured to herself, as she contrasted
her present position with that in which she had
first set foot on European soil, “It is my beauty
that has done all this!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLIII">CHAPTER CLIII.<br />

<span class="medium">FATHER AND SON.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Hatfield found his son waiting for him in the
coffee-room; and, entering the <em>citadine</em>, or one-horse
hackney-coach, in which the former had arrived,
they proceeded to the hotel at which he had
put up, and which was in the Place Vend&ocirc;me.</p>

<p>It was now past eleven o’clock; for the incidents
related in the two preceding chapters, had occupied
two full hours:&mdash;and, during that interval, how
many revelations had been made&mdash;what changes of
feeling effected&mdash;what new emotions engendered&mdash;what
bright visions destroyed!</p>

<p>Yet such is human life;&mdash;and two minutes, instead
of two hours, are often sufficient to hurl down
the finest fabrics of happiness which the imagination
has ever built up in the realms of fancy or the
sphere of reality.</p>

<p>On arriving at the hotel in the Place Vend&ocirc;me,
the father and son repaired to the apartment occupied
by the former; and Charles threw himself on a
sofa, as if exhausted and overwhelmed by the terrible
excitement he had undergone that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield related to him all that had passed
between Perdita and himself after the young man
had quitted the room; and Charles was rejoiced,&mdash;if
rejoiced he could be in the midst of the strange
thoughts and reminiscences which crowded upon
him,&mdash;to learn that the family papers were secure in
his father’s possession.</p>

<p>“And those papers shall no longer be a source of
alarm and embarrassment to those whom they so
deeply regard,” said Mr. Hatfield, when he had
brought his brief narrative to a conclusion: then,
ringing the bell, he ordered the waiter who answered
the summons to bring him a lighted candle.</p>

<p>This command was speedily obeyed; and when the
domestic had retired, Mr. Hatfield, having thrown
all the documents upon the hearth, set them alight.
While they were consuming,&mdash;those precious papers,
which were worth an Earldom to him, did he choose
to avail himself of the proofs which they contained,&mdash;both
himself and his son watched them with a
fixed gaze, but with different emotions. For Charles
sighed as he thought of the bright dreams which the
perusal of those papers had so lately excited in his
imagination; and Mr. Hatfield experienced an indescribable
relief in witnessing their destruction.</p>

<p>“Now,” he exclaimed, in a tone of triumph, “no
living soul can dispute my brother’s right to the
rank which he bears and the estates which he possesses!
Nor think, Charles,” he added, turning to
his son, and speaking in a calmer and more measured
voice,&mdash;“think not that it costs me a pang thus to
dispose of these papers. The flame has died away&mdash;naught
save a heap of tinder remains&mdash;and I have
willingly and cheerfully resigned the power of ever
doing mischief, or being made the instrument of
wrong, towards a brother to whom I owe so much.
But enough of this: and now tell me, Charles, in
details as ample as you can bring your mind to endure,
the whole particulars of your unfortunate
connexion with these women, in order to convince
me that nothing more remains to be accomplished
to rid ourselves completely of them. For you must
remember that though we have managed to dispose
of the daughter, the mother still possesses a knowledge
of many secrets which we would not have
revealed.”</p>

<p>Charles immediately complied with his father’s
request, and narrated how Mrs. Fitzhardinge had
accosted him in the street,&mdash;how she had spoken
mysteriously, and thereby induced him to accompany
her to Suffolk Street,&mdash;how he had there found
himself in the presence of Perdita,&mdash;and how Mrs.
Fitzhardinge on a subsequent occasion mentioned
certain family matters evincing her knowledge of
special secrets which she alleged to have been revealed
to her by the gipsy Miranda.</p>

<p>“Then it was not from your lips that she first
learnt the circumstances connected with myself!”
said Mr. Hatfield, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“No: she particularly mentioned the gipsy as her
authority for all she knew and alluded to,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“But the gipsy was unaware of the fact of my
mother’s marriage with the late Earl of Ellingham,”
observed Mr. Hatfield; “and consequently she was
ignorant of the legitimacy of my birth and the rights
belonging to me thereupon.”</p>

<p>“Oh! now a light breaks in upon my mind!”
exclaimed Charles. “I remember that she was surprised
when I told her that I was a young nobleman,
as I did then really believe myself to be; and I
likewise recollect that she afterwards spoke to me
in a manner which, while pretending a full and perfect
acquaintance with all our family affairs, led me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
to give answers which were doubtless revelations
of secrets to her. But all this did not strike me at the
time: now, however, that the film has been removed
from my eyes, I behold things in a clearer and truer
light.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and I also can understand this matter,”
said Mr. Hatfield, after a few moments’ deep thought
“On their return to England, these women must
have fallen in with Miranda: from her lips they
heard enough to put them in possession of secrets
which they doubtless intended to use for the purpose
of extorting money from <em>me</em> through <em>you</em>.
Then your infatuation in respect to the daughter,
led you to speak to the mother in such a random,
inconsiderate manner as to make her more fully
aware of our family’s position. Thus, while affecting
to know all, she drew from you those details
which filled up the chapters that were wanting in
the history as Miranda originally told it. Yes&mdash;this
must be the truth and the explanation of the whole
affair;&mdash;and now it remains for us to hasten to
England without delay, and, in case the old woman
shall be relieved from the charge at present existing
against her, purchase her secrecy and her exile in
the same way as we have arranged with her daughter.”</p>

<p>“But how can I face my mother?” asked Charles,
in a tone expressive of the deepest grief: “how meet
the Earl of Ellingham, whom I have sought to
injure&mdash;and Lady Frances, to whom I have conducted
myself in so scandalous a manner?”</p>

<p>“Now you recognise the impropriety of your behaviour
towards her!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield.
“Oh! I am rejoiced to perceive that your heart is
open to impressions of such a saving nature!”</p>

<p>“The incidents of this day have made me an
altered man,” said Charles, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Then am I almost happy that they have occurred!”
cried his father. “The teachings have
been bitter&mdash;bitter indeed, my poor boy; but the
results may constitute an ample recompense alike
to yourself and your parents. <em>We</em> have recovered
a son&mdash;<em>you</em> have acquired an experience ten thousand
times more valuable than the best precepts
ever inculcated by mortal tongue.”</p>

<p>“Oh! this is true&mdash;most true, father!” exclaimed
Charles. “But you have not answered the questions&mdash;the
painful questions&mdash;which I have put to you.”</p>

<p>“First, then, with regard to your mother,” responded
Mr. Hatfield, “you know that she will receive
you with open arms. In respect to the Earl,
he must be told all&mdash;every thing; and you may
count upon his generosity. But it is with reference
to Lady Frances Ellingham, who loves you&mdash;from
whom the causes of your flight have been carefully
concealed&mdash;and who cannot be informed of your
sad connexion with a profligate woman,&mdash;Oh! it is
in regard to her, that I know not how to act&mdash;that
I am bewildered&mdash;cruelly embarrassed!”</p>

<p>“Remember, my dear father,” said Charles, in a
tone of deep humility, “that henceforth I shall do
your bidding in all things. You have but to speak&mdash;and
I obey.”</p>

<p>“Think not, my dear son,” answered Mr. Hatfield,
“that I shall claim of you a deference incompatible
with your age and social position&mdash;or
that I shall attempt to exercise an authority that
may seem to have borrowed any taint of severity
from the experience of the past. No: but I shall
counsel and advise you as a friend&mdash;and in your best
interest shall I ever speak. On our arrival in London,
we will not return immediately to Pall Mall;
but we will repair to an hotel, whence I will send
privately for the Earl; and his advice will assist me
in respect to the course to be observed towards his
amiable daughter. And now, Charles, do you feel
yourself capable of commencing at once our journey
homeward?&mdash;or are you too much exhausted&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no: let us depart from Paris without
delay!” exclaimed the young man. “I have no
longer any object in remaining here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield rang the bell; and a waiter made
his appearance.</p>

<p>“A chaise-and-four as speedily as possible,” was
the laconic command given; “and you must have our
passports backed for Boulogne or Calais.”</p>

<p>The domestic bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>Two hours afterwards the father and son were
seated together in the chaise, which was rolling
rapidly along the road to Saint Denis.</p>

<p>“I will now give you some account of the adventures
which I experienced in pursuit of you,” said
Mr. Hatfield, who felt that the silence previously
existing between himself and Charles was growing
painful: for they had not uttered a word from the
moment they entered the vehicle until Mr. Hatfield
now spoke&mdash;an interval of nearly half-an-hour.</p>

<p>“I shall be pleased to hear them,” observed the
young man, anxious to divert his thoughts from the
painful topics that were naturally occupying them:
“for I must confess that I am at a loss to conjecture
how you happened to fall in with the officers
at Dover, and how you were enabled to trace me to
the hotel where you this morning found me.”</p>

<p>“The explanation of all this is readily given,”
said Mr. Hatfield; and as the chaise was rolling
along the unpaved part of the road, there was no
effort necessary to make his voice audible. “I shall
commence with the incidents of the morning on
which you quitted London in company with the two
females whose pernicious influence has worked so
much mischief. You remember that a most painful
interview took place between yourself and me in
the library, and that you burst away&mdash;perhaps just
at the moment when explanations might have arisen
to convince you of the futility of your ambitious
hopes and golden visions in respect to birth and
title. Shortly after you thus left me, the Earl
entered the room; and a conversation which took
place, led to the mention of the secret papers. He
sought for them in the recess to which he had consigned
them&mdash;and they were gone. At the same
moment I obtained the conviction that the <cite>Annual
Register</cite> for a certain year, and containing a certain
dreadful narrative, had been lately read. Then a
light broke in upon the Earl and myself; and we
penetrated the motives of the strange conduct you
had recently observed towards your parents. At
this juncture, Mr. Clarence Villiers made his appearance;
and, on consulting him, we learnt to our
dismay that the women who passed under the name
Fitzhardinge were his aunt and cousin,&mdash;Mrs.
Slingsby, who was transported years ago for forgery&mdash;and
Perdita, her illegitimate child, born in
Newgate, a few weeks previous to her departure.
You may conceive the anguish which we endured
when we found that you had become connected
with such women; and Villiers hastened to Suffolk
Street to obtain an interview with you.”</p>

<p>“Would to God that he had succeeded in finding
me&mdash;that my departure with those wretches had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
been only delayed a few minutes!” cried Charles,
still a prey to the most harrowing feelings.</p>

<div id="i_185" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_185.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Alas! you had already fled,” continued Mr. Hatfield;
“and when Villiers returned to communicate
this fact, an instantaneous pursuit was resolved
upon. Clarence took one road&mdash;the Earl another&mdash;and
I chose the road to Dover. I was mounted on
a good horse, and must have inevitably overtaken
you before you had proceeded many miles, when, on
turning an angle of the road, I suddenly encountered
a light chaise-cart that was turning the corner at a
furious rate. The shock was violent; and I was
hurled from my horse with such force that I was
stunned by the fall. When I recovered my senses
I was lying on a bed at a small road-side tavern;
and a candle was burning in the room. It was night:
hours had elapsed since the accident which had occurred;
and during that long interval I had remained
senseless&mdash;unconscious of all that was passing.
A surgeon had been sent for from Greenwich,
near which place the accident occurred; and he was
an ignorant quack who had adopted no effective
measures to recover me. But nature had at length
asserted her empire in that where medical mismanagement
had necessarily failed to produce any good
result; and I recovered my powers of thought&mdash;only
to experience the bitterest anguish at the delay
that had taken place. Ill and suffering as I was, I
endeavoured to rise, with the determination of pursuing
my journey; but this was impossible. For in
the first place I was too much exhausted to leave
the couch on which I was thus helplessly stretched;
and, secondly, I learnt, to my increased annoyance,
that my horse was injured in a serious manner. To
be brief, I resigned myself to the necessity of at least
remaining a few hours longer in that place; and a
deep sleep came over me. In the morning I awoke,
much refreshed, though still suffering from the pain
of the severe contusions that I had received. All
hope of continuing my journey on horseback was
destroyed; and I accordingly procured a post-chaise
in which I hastened on to Dover. There I
arrived in the afternoon; and by accident I put up
at the same hotel where you and your female companions
had stopped. On inquiring I heard that
yourself and the young lady had departed for Calais
in the morning, and that the old one had been arrested
on her way to the port, in consequence of a
communication received by electric telegraph from
London. No steam vessel was to leave for France
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
until the following day; and I was therefore compelled
to wait patiently at the hotel. Patiently, indeed!
No&mdash;<em>that</em> was impossible;&mdash;for all these delays
were maddening, under the circumstances. But
I will not dwell at unnecessary length on any portion
of my narrative&mdash;much less upon the nature of
the feelings which I experienced at that time. In
the evening I dined in the coffee-room&mdash;if the mere
mockery of sitting down to table and eating nothing
can be called dining; and, while I was thus
seated at a repast which I did not touch, I was suddenly
interested in a conversation which was taking
place between two officers who were discussing a
bottle of wine at an adjacent table.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I ought to have perceived that there was
something mysterious and wrong in that adventure
upon the Marine Parade!” cried Charles, literally
savage with himself at his blindness and folly. “But
I was so completely infatuated by that artful, designing
creature&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I must implore you to compose yourself,” interrupted
Mr. Hatfield, in an earnest but kind tone:
“for if I am now relating to you all that occurred to
me, it is only that you may become acquainted with
everything, and have nothing left behind as a cause
for future excitement. Therefore I will be explicit
with you respecting the substance of the conversation
which was passing between those officers
in the manner I have described. Indeed, you may
conceive my astonishment when I overheard one of
them mention the name of <em>Perdita</em>; for that is by no
means a common one&mdash;and perhaps this woman is
the only being on the face of the earth who bears it.
I accordingly listened&mdash;and in a short time the
whole adventure which had taken place on the
Parade the evening before, became known to me.
Then I addressed myself to the two officers, stating
that I had overheard their remarks, apologising for
my rudeness in listening, but excusing myself on
the ground that the young gentleman whom they had
seen with Perdita was nearly allied to me, and that
I was, in fact, in pursuit of him. They assured me
that no apology was necessary; and I joined them
in conversation. Then was it that I learnt a dreadful
tale of female depravity; for it appears that
Perdita became indeed the ‘<em>Lost One</em>’ at a very
early age, and that her favours were distributed in
Sydney to any good-looking young man who might
happen to please her fancy.”</p>

<p>“Vile&mdash;detested Perdita!” ejaculated Charles,
almost gnashing his teeth with rage.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you must know her character fully, my
poor boy,” said Mr. Hatfield; “for fear that she
should ever again endeavour to exercise her syren
influence upon you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, such an attempt would be utter madness on
her part!” cried Charles, now speaking with every
symptom of the deepest indignation and even loathing.
“But what more said the officers whom you
thus singularly encountered?”</p>

<p>“It appears,” continued Mr. Hatfield, “that
Perdita was not thoroughly depraved in the sense
in which we allude to an unfortunate woman who
plies her hideous trade for bread. No&mdash;she bartered
not her charms for gold. Indeed, though very poor,
she would scarcely ever receive any recompense
from her favourites&mdash;unless delicately conveyed in
the form of presents. But money she never took:
her pride revolted at <em>that</em>,&mdash;and it was purely through
the wantonness of her disposition and the burning
ardour of her temperament that she plunged headlong
into a career of licentiousness.”</p>

<p>“And I to have fallen the victim to such a polluted
wretch!” exclaimed the young man.</p>

<p>“At Sydney,” continued Mr. Hatfield, “she was
looked upon as a species of prodigy. Endowed
with an intellect as powerful as her beauty was
great, and possessing extraordinary natural abilities,
she listened with eagerness to the conversation
of those officers and other gentlemen who became
her favourites, and treasured up all the information
she could thus acquire. She was also fond of reading
the newspapers sent from England, and all
works treating of the mother-country and the
principal nations of Europe; and thus she gleaned
a vast amount of miscellaneous knowledge, fitting
her to become a woman of the world. With singular
facility, too, she studied and appropriated
the gentility of gait, demeanour, and manners which
she observed in her superiors; and the very
bearing of the ladies in Sydney, as they walked
abroad, was noted and adopted by her. Thus
even in her poverty, to which she clung rather than
surrender up her independence by becoming a wife
or a kept mistress&mdash;for she might have been either&mdash;even
in her poverty, I say, there was an air of
lofty pride and calm hauteur about her, which
would have led a stranger to fancy that she had
sprung from an aristocratic stock, whose family
fortunes had decayed. Moreover, her spirit was
indomitable and fiery; and she knew full well how
to avenge an insult. Did she receive overtures
from any one who was displeasing to her, she would
reject them with scorn; and, if possible, she would
punish the adventurous suitor, in one way or
another, for his insolence in addressing her. It was
her delight at times to throw around herself&mdash;her
deeds&mdash;her words&mdash;and even her entire character,
a veil of mystery, and to affect an eccentricity of
habits and a singularity of manner which made
many ignorant and credulous people imagine that
she was a being of no common order. Amongst
those who might be properly styled her equals, she
was reserved, cold, and distant; and even to those
whom, in the same sense, we may denominate her
superiors, she demeaned herself condescendingly, as
if conferring a favour on them by her presence.
In her amours, she maintained this singular pride,
as if she were a Catherine of Russia, inviting her
lovers to her arms, but never yielding to an invitation
that might come from them. In a word, this
Perdita was looked upon as the most remarkable,
and at the same time the most unintelligible&mdash;the
most incomprehensible character at Sydney;
and even the most respectable persons were anxious
to have her pointed out to them, when they walked
abroad. Endowed with such a splendid intellect&mdash;possessed
of such rare and almost superhuman loveliness&mdash;robing
herself, as it were, in mystery&mdash;and
evincing so proud a spirit, as well as such an aptitude
for the self-appropriation of the refinements
and the etiquette of genteel breeding,&mdash;it cannot be
wondered at if Perdita should have been regarded
in no common light by the inhabitants of the penal
settlement. But from all I have now told you,
Charles, it is easy for you to comprehend how dangerous
is the character of such a woman&mdash;how completely
she must be the mistress of every art in the
school of hypocrisy, guile, and deceit; and if I have
been thus elaborate in my details respecting her&mdash;if
I have thus minutely recapitulated all that I
learnt from the two officers at Dover&mdash;it is simply
to place you more effectually upon your guard with
reference to that syren&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>“I have already said,” interrupted Charles,
speaking with the vehemence of sincerity and of
deep conviction, “that never&mdash;never could she resume
her empire over me! Oh! my dear father, the
lesson has been too terrible not to have served as a
warning; and sooner would I seek the embrace of
a hideous serpent, than suffer myself to be allured
back to the arms of Perdita. And&mdash;oh!” ejaculated
the young man, a sudden reminiscence flashing to
his mind, “I should have taken warning, days and
days ago; for I recollect a fearful dream which I
had, and which I must now look upon as providential!
Madman that I was to neglect so solemn a
foreshadowing of the truth!”</p>

<p>“Compose yourself, Charles,” cried Mr. Hatfield;
“and now let me finish my narrative. I had
reached that point which related to my accidental
interview with the officers at Dover, where I was
compelled to pass the night&mdash;a night of cruel
and torturing suspense! Next morning, I crossed
to Calais, and there I obtained a trace of you
at Dessin’s hotel. Without delay I took a post-chaise,
and hurried on in pursuit. I reached Paris
at five last evening, and put up at the hotel whence
we started just now. But I had not any time to
lose, for I felt convinced that you intended to marry
Perdita. I accordingly hurried off to the British
Embassy, either to know the worst, if the worst
were indeed already accomplished&mdash;or to take any
measures I could to anticipate the ceremony, in
case it should not have been as yet performed.
But I could not obtain any satisfactory intelligence;
no one to whom I addressed myself was able to
state whether certain persons whom I described
had been married during the day or not. I drove
to the dwelling of the chaplain&mdash;but he had gone a
few miles into the country. I found out the abode
of his clerk&mdash;but this official was likewise from
home. Almost distracted, I sped to the Prefecture
of Police to ascertain if it were possible to discover
your address in Paris, knowing that the landlords
of all hotels are under the necessity of making
daily returns of the names of their lodgers to the
proper authorities. But I found the Prefecture
closed for the night; and I returned, exhausted
with fatigue and disconsolate in mind, to the hotel.
Summoning the <em>commissionaire</em>, I gave him the
necessary instructions to make particular inquiries
at the Prefecture, the moment that establishment
should open in the morning. This he promised to
do, and I retired to bed&mdash;but not to rest!”</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear father,” exclaimed Charles, seizing
his parent’s hand, and pressing it with fervour to
his lips, “how can you ever pardon me for all the
uneasiness I have occasioned you?&mdash;and if <em>you</em> can,
how shall I hope to receive the forgiveness of my
mother, when she learns all the sorrow you have
endured on my account?”</p>

<p>“It is not, perhaps, necessary that your mother
should be made acquainted with <em>every thing</em>,” observed
Mr. Hatfield, emphatically: “but all this
will depend upon circumstances&mdash;especially on the
results of our previous and private interview with
Lord Ellingham. As for you and me, Charles, we
have already forgiven each other every thing,” said
Mr. Hatfield, in a solemn tone. “And now my
narrative has reached its conclusion,” he added;
“for shortly after eight o’clock this morning, the
<em>commissionaire</em> came and informed me that he had
discovered the hotel where you were residing. You
know the rest.”</p>

<p>Charles sighed, but made no answer, and the
journey was continued for a long time in profound
silence.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLIV">CHAPTER CLIV.<br />

<span class="medium">MRS. FITZHARDINGE.</span></h2>

<p>Return we now to Mrs. Fitzhardinge, whom the
officers of justice had arrested at Dover, on suspicion
of being concerned in the murder of Mr. Percival,
the miser.</p>

<p>The old woman, when made acquainted with the
cause of her apprehension, was completely thunder-struck;
for, in truth, she had not even heard until
that moment of the dreadful deed which had taken
place. But the Dover constables who took her into
custody, and who were in plain clothes, insisted
upon her accompanying them to London; and,
yielding to the imperious necessity with as good a
grace as possible, Mrs. Fitzhardinge cherished that
consolation that her innocence must inevitably become
apparent when the case should undergo a
magisterial investigation.</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons, she made no mention of
her daughter and Charles, who, she doubted not,
had embarked in safety; neither did she volunteer
any explanations relative to her acquaintance with
Mr. Percival, or the business which she had with
him on the night when, as it appeared, the murder
was committed. She had already in her life passed
through the ordeal of arrest&mdash;examination at a
police-court&mdash;committal&mdash;trial&mdash;and condemnation&mdash;aye,
and expiation also; and she was well aware
that unseasonable garrulity, or explanatory remarks
inconsiderately volunteered, seldom benefit even the
innocent person when unjustly accused. She accordingly
shrouded herself, or, rather, took refuge
in a complete silence, from which the officers did
not seek to draw her, as they all proceeded together
by railway to London.</p>

<p>On their arrival in the metropolis at a somewhat
late hour in the afternoon, Mrs. Fitzhardinge was
consigned to Clerkenwell prison, where she passed
the night; and at ten o’clock on the following
morning she was removed in a cab to Marylebone
police-court, to undergo an examination relative to
the serious charge existing against her.</p>

<p>The prisoner, who had retained counsel in her
behalf, and made other arrangements for her defence,
appeared perfectly cool and collected; and
although the sinister expression of her countenance
might have told somewhat in her disfavour, in the
estimation of common observers, yet, to the eye of
the experienced magistrate, it spoke not of guilt in
this instance. Nevertheless, that very experience
which he possessed taught him not to judge either
way by outward appearances; and he therefore
prepared himself to give the matter the most searching
investigation.</p>

<p>The first witness examined was Mrs. Dyer, who
deposed as follows:&mdash;“I occupy a house adjoining
that of the deceased. At half-past eleven o’clock
on the night in question, I returned home from the
dwelling of a friend in the neighbourhood, and saw
deceased at his door, taking leave of two females.
He had a light in his hand. One of the women,
who seemed by her figure and general appearance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
to be young, was at the garden-gate; and I could
not see her countenance. The light which the deceased
carried fell fully upon the face of the other
female; and I therefore obtained a good view of her.
The prisoner at the bar is the female alluded to.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dyer then narrated how she and her lodgers
had discovered the murder on the ensuing morning;
but these details are already known to the reader.</p>

<p>The inspector of police who had the case in hand,
was next examined, and his deposition was to the
following effect:&mdash;“In consequence of the information
I received from Mrs. Dyer, immediately after
the murder was discovered, I instituted certain inquiries,
and ascertained, in the course of the morning,
that an old and a young woman had taken a
cab in the neighbourhood of the Angel at Islington,
on the previous night, which was the one in question.
They drove to Suffolk-street, Pall Mall,
where the young lady paid the driver his fare from
a heavy and well-filled purse. The driver gave me
a description of the elder female; and that description
tallied with the one already given by Mrs.
Dyer. I thereupon repaired to Suffolk-street, and
learnt that the two women had taken their departure
in a post-chaise, between nine and ten
o’clock that morning. This was the morning
after the murder. Previous to their departure,
they were joined by a young gentleman who
went away with them. He had called on several
occasions at the lodgings; and his name was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here the magistrate interposed, and said that
it might not be necessary to mention this name
publicly, as there was nothing to implicate the
gentleman referred to.</p>

<p>The inspector accordingly proceeded thus:&mdash;“The
chaise was sent for in a great hurry, and its
destination was unknown to the landlady and servants
of the house. No previous intimation of
the intended departure of the lodgers had been
given. They settled all their liabilities before they
left. The prisoner at the bar paid the rent and
other little matters owing; but did not display any
large sum of money. Having ascertained all these
particulars, I sent a description of the elder female
to the various railways having electric telegraphs;
and the prisoner at the bar was apprehended at
Dover, in consequence of the information thus conveyed.”</p>

<p>Upon being cross-examined by the learned gentleman
for the defence, the inspector fairly and
impartially deposed as follows:&mdash;“The stake with
which the murder was evidently perpetrated, was
found by the side of the corpse. It was taken from
a piece of unenclosed waste ground at the back of
the house. I believe this to be the fact, because I
have discovered a hole from which a stake had
most likely been taken; and the stake now produced
fits that hole. I also discovered marks of
footsteps between the back door of the house and
the spot where the stake had been pulled up.
Those marks are of a man’s boots. The soil of
some part of the waste ground is moist and damp.
There are marks on the window-ledge of the back
parlour, as if some one with dirty boots or shoes
had clambered up and stood there. The shutters
have numerous heart-holes in them, so that a person
standing up on the ledge, outside the window
could see into the back parlour. I discovered no
traces of any female footsteps on the waste ground
neither are there two descriptions of marks. They
are all produced by the same sized boots. The
door-post of the back gate was cut away from the
outside. Whoever did it must have known the
precise place where the bolt fitted into the door-post
in the inside. The cutting away rendered it
easy to force back the bolt with the fingers. The
work of cutting was performed, I should say, with
a knife&mdash;most probably a pocket or clasp-knife. It
must have taken half an hour at the least to accomplish;
and the hand that did it must have been
tolerably strong. There are marks of footsteps,
indicated in the same manner as those on the window-ledge,
up the stairs from the back door to the
back parlour. The lock of the back door so often
alluded to, was picked from the outside.”</p>

<p>The inspector’s evidence terminated here; and
the counsel for Mrs. Fitzhardinge recalled Mrs.
Dyer.</p>

<p>“Will you state, as accurately as you can, the
hour when you returned home on the night of the
murder?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Half-past eleven, sir,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“That will do,” said the learned gentleman, who
forthwith proceeded to call the driver of the cab
which Mrs. Fitzhardinge and Perdita had taken on
the night in question. “At what hour,” he demanded,
“did the prisoner and the young lady who
accompanied her hire your vehicle?”</p>

<p>“It was twelve o’clock,” replied the man. “I
am sure it was precisely midnight, because I had
just left a public-house when I was hailed by the
ladies.”</p>

<p>This witness was ordered to stand down; and
the landlady of the house in Suffolk-street was
called next. She deposed that she was sitting up
for her lodgers on the night in question, and that
they reached home at twenty minutes to one. She
was certain as to the correctness of her statement,
because she looked at the clock in the passage as
she passed by to let the ladies in. There was
nothing confused in their manner. She attended
them to the door of their bed-chamber, and did not
observe that their shoes were at all soiled with
damp clay. She was convinced that they did not
leave the house again that night. The ladies had
always appeared to have plenty of money from the
very day they entered her dwelling.</p>

<p>The learned counsel then proceeded to address
the magistrate on behalf of Mrs. Fitzhardinge. He
began by remarking on the meagre nature of the
evidence against her&mdash;the mere fact that she and
the young lady who was with her, and who was
her daughter, were the last persons seen in the
company of the murdered man;&mdash;and he complained
bitterly that his client should have been arrested&mdash;ignominiously
brought back to London&mdash;and forced
through the ordeal of a public examination on such
a shallow pretence. Every circumstance, adduced
that morning&mdash;every feature of the evidence, tended
only to exculpate the prisoner at the bar. In the
first place, it was clear, from the testimony recorded,
that the prisoner and her daughter had quitted the
house of the deceased at half-past eleven&mdash;had taken
a cab at the Angel at midnight&mdash;and had driven
straight home, reaching Suffolk-street at twenty
minutes to one. Now the distance from the scene
of the murder to the Angel would require rapid
walking for two females to accomplish in half an
hour, and leave not an instant to accomplish the
crime before they set out, much less to cut away the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
door-post, ransack the deceased’s boxes, and so
forth. From the Angel they were traced home,
and they did not leave the house again that night.
Now, the evidence of the inspector of police tended,
to show incontestibly that the murder had been
perpetrated by a man. He (the learned counsel)
was instructed to state that Mrs. Fitzhardinge and
her daughter had called upon Mr. Percival for the
purpose of obtaining the discount of a bill; that he
did discount the document, and that he left his
cash-box open on the table during the negotiation.
It was presumable that some man, who probably
knew the premises well, had clambered up against
the back-window, had beheld the cash-box and its
contents, and, during the night, had perpetrated the
bloody deed. The speedy departure of the prisoner,
her daughter, and the gentleman who had been
alluded to, on the morning following that night of
the crime, was occasioned by the fact that the
young people contemplated a matrimonial alliance
unknown to the gentleman’s parents; and the means
of travelling having been procured by the discount
already mentioned, there was no necessity to delay
the departure for Paris any longer. This was the
simple and plain explanation of the suddenly undertaken
journey and the precipitate decampment
from Suffolk-street. But the ladies did not act as
if they had committed a crime, nor their male companion
as if he had been an accomplice in one; for
they travelled by post-chaise instead of by rail, to
Dover; and there they waited quietly until the
steam-packet left next morning, instead of hiring
some small craft, as they might have done, to waft
them across, the same night of their arrival, to
Calais. Again, if the prisoner and her daughter
had even entertained such a fearful idea as that of
depriving the miser of his life for the sake of his
gold, they would have had a better opportunity of
carrying it into execution while alone with him in
his back parlour, than by the roundabout manner
suggested by the nature of the charge against Mrs.
Fitzhardinge. During the short time the two
ladies had dwelt at the lodgings in Suffolk-street
they had not been embarrassed for want of funds;
nor even when they sought the aid of the discounter
was their need so pressing, much less was it of that
desperate nature which could alone prompt to such
a dreadful alternative as murder. The reason
why the assistance of the deceased was sought at all,
could be readily explained by the avowal that the
bill to be discounted was not a security which any
other class of money-lenders would entertain: it
was the promissory note of a young gentleman
raising cash upon his expectations, and therefore of
a character suiting only the purposes of a discounter
who took an amount of interest proportionate
to the risk which he ran. In conclusion,
the learned gentleman insisted that there was not
a shadow of evidence against his client.</p>

<p>The magistrate acquiesced in this view of the
case, and discharged Mrs. Fitzhardinge forthwith.
She was, however, compelled to repair from the
Marylebone Police-court to the tavern where the
coroner was holding an adjourned inquest upon the
body; but the result of her examination before the
magistrate being communicated to that functionary,
she was not detained on his authority. A verdict
of “Wilful murder against some person or persons
unknown” was returned, and the old woman once
more found herself at liberty.</p>

<p>The evidence given by the inspector of police at
the Marylebone court, and repeated in the presence
of the coroner, had excited certain suspicions in the
mind of Mrs. Fitzhardinge; and the more she
pondered upon the subject&mdash;the more she reflected
upon the occurrences at Percival’s house on the
night of the murder, and the details of the manner
in which the deed itself must have been accomplished,
the more confident did she become that she
could name the assassin.</p>

<p>Had circumstances permitted, she would have
remained in London to ferret out the individual
whom she thus associated with the crime: but she
could not now spare the time; for she was anxious
to proceed, without delay, to Paris, and join her
daughter and Charles Hatfield, who, she had no
doubt, had reached that capital in safety.</p>

<p>Her examination at the police-court, and her
attendance at the inquest, had however consumed
the entire day; and she therefore waited until the
next morning, when she departed by the first train
for Folkestone, at which town she arrived in time to
embark on board a steamer for Boulogne.</p>

<p>In order that we may accurately show the precise
time when Mrs. Fitzhardinge reached Paris, we
must request our readers to observe, that on the
same day that Charles and Perdita crossed the water
to Calais, the old woman was borne back to London
by the constables: on the following day, while they
were journeying towards the French capital, she
was undergoing the examination already recorded;&mdash;on
the third day, when they were married at the
British Ambassador’s chapel, she was hastening to
join them;&mdash;and it was, therefore, in the after-part
of the fourth day, being the one on which the separation
of Charles and her daughter had occurred,
that Mrs. Fitzhardinge entered Paris in the <em>diligence</em>,
or stage-coach&mdash;thoroughly wearied out by
the fatigue, annoyance, and excitement she had
lately undergone.</p>

<p>The old woman repaired to an hotel in the immediate
neighbourhood of the office where the coach
stopped; and, having changed her apparel, drove
forthwith in a hackney vehicle to the British Embassy:
for it must be remembered that she was
entirely ignorant of every thing that had taken place
in respect to her daughter and Charles since she
had been separated from them, and knew not where
they had put up in Paris. Indeed, she even had
her misgivings whether they were in the French
capital at all, or whether they might not have set
out upon some tour immediately after their marriage;
for that they were already united in matrimonial
bonds, she had no doubt. That they had
returned to Dover to look for her, she did not flatter
herself; inasmuch as she had latterly seen enough
of Perdita’s altered disposition to be fully aware
that all maternal authority or filial affection were
matters which the young lady was more inclined
to treat with contempt than with serious consideration.
But Mrs. Fitzhardinge was resolved not to
be thrust aside without an effort to regain the
maternal authority: as for the filial affection, her
soul&mdash;tanned, hardened, rendered rough and inaccessible,
and with all its best feelings irremediably
blunted by the incidents of her stormy life&mdash;her
soul, we say, experienced but a slight pang at the
idea of having to renounce that devotedness which
it is usually a mother’s joy and delight to receive at
the hands of a daughter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>No; the aim of this vile intriguing woman was
merely the re-establishment of her former ascendancy
over her daughter,&mdash;by fair means or by foul&mdash;by
conciliation or intimidation&mdash;by ministering to
her vanity and her pride, or by working on her fears&mdash;by
rendering herself necessary to her, or by reducing
her to subjection through a course of studied
despotism and tyranny. Her imagination pictured
the voluptuous and impassioned Perdita clinging
to her young husband as to something which had
become necessary to her very existence, and from
which it were death to part; and she chuckled
within herself, as she muttered between her lips,&mdash;“The
girl would have this marriage; and it shall be
made in my hands a means to subdue her! For in
her tenderest moments&mdash;when reading love in <em>his</em>
eyes, and looking love with <em>her own</em>,&mdash;when wrapt
in Elysian dreams and visions of ineffable bliss&mdash;then
will I steal near her, and whisper in her ear, ‘Perdita,
you must yield to me in all things; or with a
word&mdash;a single word&mdash;will I betray you to that
fond, confiding fool; I will blast all your happiness,
and he shall cast thee away from him as a loathsome
and polluted thing!’”</p>

<p>With such agreeable musings as these did Mrs.
Fitzhardinge while away the half-hour which the
hackney-coach occupied in driving her from the hotel
to the British Embassy. It was now five o’clock in
the evening, and she fortunately found the chaplain’s
clerk in an office to which the gate-porter
directed her to proceed. From the official to whom
she was thus referred, she learnt that Charles Hatfield
and Perdita Fitzhardinge were united in matrimonial
bonds on the previous day; and an inspection
of the register, for which she paid a small
fee, enabled her to ascertain the address they had
given as their place of abode in the French capital.</p>

<p>Satisfied with these results, Mrs. Fitzhardinge
returned to the vehicle, and ordered the coachman
to drive her to an hotel which she named, and which
was the one mentioned in the register. We should
observe that the old woman spoke French with
fluency; and thus she had no difficulty in making
herself understood in the gay city of Paris.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLV">CHAPTER CLV.<br />

<span class="medium">THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.</span></h2>

<p>On arriving at the hotel indicated, Mrs. Fitzhardinge
alighted, and inquired of the porter
whether Mr. and Mrs. Hatfield were residing there.
The man referred to a long list of names on a paper
posted against the wall; and, after running his
eye down the column, turned to the old woman
with the laconic, but respectfully uttered observation,&mdash;“Removed
to No. 9, Rue Monthabor.”</p>

<p>To this new address did Mrs. Fitzhardinge repair,
without pausing to ask any further question;
and on her arrival at the entrance to a house of
handsome appearance in the street named, she inquired
for Mr. and Mrs. Hatfield.</p>

<p>“Oh! it is all right,” said the porter. “I was
told that if any persons called to ask for Mrs. Hatfield,
I was to direct them to the lady who has
taken the second floor.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhardinge was somewhat surprised by
this ambiguous answer: but it instantly struck her
that Charles might have assumed his title of <em>Viscount
Marston</em>, and that the name of <em>Hatfield</em> would,
therefore, be unknown to the porter, had no particular
instructions been left with him. At all events,
she was in too great a hurry to remain bandying
words with the man; and she accordingly hastened
to ascend to the second floor, which, we should
observe by the way, is the most fashionable in
Parisian houses.</p>

<p>But as she mounted the staircase, it struck her
that the porter, when replying to her query, had
made no mention of any gentleman at all, but had
plainly and clearly spoken of “the lady who has
taken the second floor.” The old woman was
puzzled&mdash;indeed, bewildered by the mystery which
suddenly appeared to envelope her; and a certain
misgiving seized upon her mind, the nature of which
she could not precisely define.</p>

<p>On gaining the marble landing of the second
floor, she rang the bell at the door of the suite of
apartments on that flat, and was immediately admitted
by Rosalie into a handsomely furnished drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Whom shall I mention to mademoiselle?” inquired
the French lady’s-maid.</p>

<p>“Her mother,” was the response.</p>

<p>Rosalie withdrew; and Mrs. Fitzhardinge, seating
herself upon an elegant ottoman, cast her eyes
around the splendid room.</p>

<p>“Perdita is well lodged, at all events,” she mused
inwardly. “But somehow or another, there is a
mystery which I cannot comprehend. The porter
spoke of no gentleman&mdash;the maid was equally
silent on that head, and alluded to her mistress as
<em>mademoiselle</em><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and not as <em>madame</em>. What can it
mean?”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and Perdita
made her appearance in a charming <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;shabill&eacute;e</em>; for
she had been assisting to arrange her effects in her
newly-hired ready-furnished apartments.</p>

<p>The meeting between the mother and daughter
was characterised by nothing cordial&mdash;much less
affectionate: there was no embracing&mdash;not even a
shaking of the hand, but only a mutual desire,
hastily evinced on either side, to receive explanations.</p>

<p>“Where is Charles?” demanded Mrs. Fitzhardinge.</p>

<p>“Gone,” was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>“Gone!” ejaculated the old woman, now manifesting
the most profound astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes; gone&mdash;departed&mdash;never to return,” said
Perdita, with some degree of bitterness: then, in
an altered tone, and with recovered calmness, she
asked, “But how have you managed respecting the
accusation&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! then you have heard of <em>that</em>?” interrupted
Mrs. Fitzhardinge, with a subdued feeling of spite;
for she thought that her daughter took the matter
very quietly. “I was taken back to London&mdash;examined
at the Marylebone Police-court&mdash;and discharged
without much difficulty. Now, in your
turn, answer my next question&mdash;wherefore has
Charles left you?”</p>

<p>“In the first place,” said Perdita, “tell me how
you discovered my abode?”&mdash;and she fixed her large
grey eyes in a searching manner upon the old
woman, as if to ascertain by that look the precise
extent of her mother’s knowledge relative to herself
and Charles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>“<em>That</em> is speedily explained,” observed Mrs
Fitzhardinge, who instantly perceived that her
daughter intended to reveal to her no more than
she was actually compelled to do, and it flashed to
her mind&mdash;she knew not why&mdash;that Perdita meant
especially to throw a veil over the fact of her marriage
with Charles. Else, why had she not immediately
mentioned it?&mdash;why had she not hastened
to satisfy her that the alliance had indeed taken
place? But if Perdita <em>had</em> a motive in concealing
that fact, then the knowledge of the secret might
sooner or later prove serviceable to Mrs. Fitzhardinge;
and she therefore resolved to feign ignorance.
All these thoughts and calculations swept
through the old woman’s brain in a moment; and
she preserved the while the most steady composure
of countenance. “<em>That</em> is speedily explained,” she
repeated. “I went to the Prefecture of Police,
and learnt your address.”</p>

<p>“But you knew not by what name to ask for
me,” said Perdita, still keeping her eyes fixed on
her mother’s countenance.</p>

<p>“I inquired for you by the name of Fitzhardinge,”
answered the old woman, hazarding the falsehood;
“and was referred to the hotel where you and
Charles had put up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And on your calling there?” asked Perdita, impatiently.</p>

<p>“The porter laconically told me that you had removed
hither,” returned the old woman. “But
what means the absence of Charles? and has he not
married you?”</p>

<p>“No,” responded Perdita, reading in her mother’s
countenance more intently&mdash;more searchingly than
hitherto: “he has played a perfidious part, and deserted
me.”</p>

<p>“The villain!” ejaculated the old woman, affecting
to give full credence to the denial that the
matrimonial alliance had taken place; while, on the
other hand, Perdita was completely deceived by her
mother’s profound duplicity.</p>

<p>“The adventures I have experienced,” said Perdita,
“have been numerous and exciting. When
every thing was settled for the ceremony to take
place, the father of Charles suddenly appeared
upon the scene, and exposed me in a cruel manner
to his son. In fact, Mr. Hatfield proved himself
to be well acquainted with all&mdash;every thing&mdash;relating
to you and me; and he unsparingly availed
himself of that knowledge. I retaliated&mdash;I convinced
him that his family affairs were no secret to
me;&mdash;and then he again assumed the part of one
who triumphs in defeating the hopes of another;
for he produced unquestionable evidence to the fact
that his son is illegitimate, and entirely dependent
upon him.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Mrs. Fitzhardinge, who now
fancied that she read the reason which had induced
Perdita to conceal her marriage with the young
man. “Then, after all, your suitor is plain Charles
Hatfield, and not Viscount Marston?”</p>

<p>“Such is indeed the case, mother,” returned Perdita;
“and I think you will agree with me that I
have had a fortunate escape.”</p>

<p>“I do congratulate you on that point,” answered
the old woman, her dissimulation continuing impenetrable.
“But where have you obtained the
means to hire this handsome lodging?”</p>

<p>“You cannot suppose that I allowed Mr. Hatfield
and his son to depart without making ample
provision for me!” exclaimed Perdita. “No;
I displayed a too intimate acquaintance with
all their family affairs to permit them thus to abandon
me. Besides, the very secret of the young
man’s illegitimacy&mdash;a secret which the father revealed
in a moment of excitement, produced by the
discussion that took place between us&mdash;that
secret&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand you, Perdita,” said Mrs. Fitzhardinge:
“it was necessary to purchase your
silence respecting a matter that involved the good
name and the honour of Lady Georgiana Hatfield.
Well, have you made a profitable bargain for yourself?”</p>

<p>“A thousand pounds in ready money; and five
hundred a year for life, on condition that I return
not to England,” was the response.</p>

<p>“Good!” ejaculated the old woman, her eyes
glistening with delight.</p>

<p>“And I have adopted another name, for a variety
of reasons,” continued Perdita. “In the first place,
having learnt from that hated Mr. Hatfield of your
arrest at Dover, and the nature of the charge against
you, I feared lest the whole thing should be blazoned
in the newspapers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” interrupted her mother: “I understand!
The name of <em>Fitzhardinge</em> would suit no
longer. What is the new one?”</p>

<p>“I have taken that of <em>Mortimer</em>,” answered the
daughter. “Laura Mortimer sounds prettily, I
think?”</p>

<p>“Then you have not even retained your Christian
name?” said the old woman, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“No; for it is so uncommon, that it could not
fail to excite attention, wherever whispered,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“In this case, I am to become Mrs. Mortimer?”
continued the mother.</p>

<p>“Precisely so; and as a matter of course, you
will take up your abode with me.”</p>

<p>“You do not appear particularly unhappy at the
loss of the young man whom you fell so deeply in
love with?” observed the old woman, whom we
must now denominate Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“That dream has passed&mdash;gone by&mdash;vanished!” returned
Laura&mdash;for by this Christian name is Perdita
to be henceforth known; and as she spoke, her voice
assumed a deep and even menacing tone. “Yes&mdash;that
illusion is dissipated; and, if circumstances permit,
I will have vengeance where I used to think only
of love.”</p>

<p>“To what circumstances do you allude?” demanded
Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Can you not understand <em>my</em> position&mdash;aye, and
<em>your own</em> position also?” exclaimed Laura. “At
present we are dependent, to a certain degree, upon
Mr. Hatfield, and must adhere to the conditions he
imposed upon me: that is to say, we must reside on
the continent so long as the income allowed by him
shall be indispensably necessary. But the moment
that I can carve out a new career of fortune for
myself, either by a brilliant marriage, or by enchaining
some wealthy individual in my silken
meshes,&mdash;the instant that I find myself in a condition
to spurn the aid of Mr. Hatfield’s purse, and
can command treasures from another quarter,&mdash;then,
mother, <em>then</em>,” added Laura, emphatically, “will be
the time for vengeance! For, think you,” she continued,
drawing herself proudly up to her full
height, while her nostrils dilated and her eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
flashed fire,&mdash;“think you that, if I have loved as a
woman, I will not likewise be avenged as a woman?
Oh! yes&mdash;yes; and welcome&mdash;most welcome will
be that day when I shall see myself independent of
the purse of Mr. Hatfield, and able to work out my
vengeance after the manner of my own heart! To
be exposed by the father and discarded by the son&mdash;to
have the mask torn away from my countenance
by the former, and be looked upon with loathing
and abhorrence by the latter,&mdash;oh, all this is enough
to drive me mad&mdash;mad! And if I retained a calm
demeanour and a stern composure of countenance
in the presence of those men this morning, it was
only the triumph of an indomitable pride over feelings
wounded in the most sensitive point!”</p>

<p>“Vengeance, indeed, is a pleasing consummation,”
said the old woman: then, after an instant’s pause,
she added, “And I also have a vengeance to gratify.”</p>

<p>“You, mother!” ejaculated Laura, with unfeigned
surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. You remember the night that we called
upon Percival? Well, you may recollect how he
spoke of a certain visitor who had been with
him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Torrens&mdash;your husband,” observed Laura,
quietly.</p>

<p>“The same. He was the murderer of Percival,”
added Mrs. Mortimer, her countenance assuming
an expression so fiend-like, that it was horrible to
behold.</p>

<p>“How know you that?” demanded Laura, surprised.</p>

<p>“I am convinced of it,” returned her mother.
“Listen! On that night when we visited the miser,
Torrens had been with him: indeed, he had departed
from the house only the moment before we knocked
at the door. You remember that Percival said so?
Well&mdash;and you also recollect that Torrens was
represented to be poor and very miserable? While
we were engaged with Percival, the cash-box was
produced, and its contents were displayed. A man
clambered up to the window, and looked through
the holes in the shutters. This was proved at the
police-office. We departed, and the miser was left
alone. The back gate was forced open&mdash;or, rather,
the wood-work was cut away in such a manner as
to allow the bolt to be shot back with the fingers&mdash;and
the lock was picked with a piece of iron. All
this was done from the <em>outside</em>. Then, again, the
stake whereby the old man was killed was taken from
a piece of waste ground at the back of the house;
and on the damp clayey soil the marks of boots
were discovered. The murder was therefore perpetrated
by the man whose footsteps were thus
traced; and who could that man be but Torrens?
I have no doubt of the accuracy of my conjectures.”</p>

<p>“They are reasonable, at the least,” observed
Laura. “But wherefore do you trouble your head
about him, when I require your assistance here in
a matter of importance?”</p>

<p>“One moment, and you shall explain your views
when I have made you acquainted with mine,” said
Mrs. Mortimer. “Percival was a rich man, and that
cash-box contained a treasure in notes and gold.
Torrens has, no doubt, concealed himself somewhere
in London;&mdash;a man who has committed such a crime
invariably regards the metropolis itself as the safest
hiding-place. My design is to ferret him out, and
compel him by menaces to surrender into my keeping
the treasure which he has obtained. You and I,
Perdita&mdash;Laura, I mean&mdash;will know how to spend
those thousands; and it will give me pleasure&mdash;unfeigned
pleasure,” she added, with a fearful expression
of countenance, “to know that <em>he</em> has been
plunged back again into misery and want.”</p>

<p>“The project is a good one, mother,” said Laura;
“and the money would prove most welcome.
Possessed of a few thousands of pounds, I would at
once act in complete independence of Mr. Hatfield.
But wherefore this bitter vengeance against the
man who is still your husband?”</p>

<p>“Because, when he was released from Newgate
upwards of nineteen years ago, when imprisoned
there on suspicion of having murdered a certain Sir
Henry Courtenay,” said the old woman,&mdash;“when he
was set free, I tell you, I still languished a prisoner
in that horrible gaol. And he came not near me:
he recognised me not&mdash;he loathed and abhorred me;
and I knew it! <em>You</em>, Laura, have felt how terrible
it is to be hated&mdash;shunned&mdash;forsaken by one on
whom you have claims: <em>you</em> are still smarting
under the conduct of Charles Hatfield. Can you
not, then, comprehend how I should cherish feelings
of bitterness against that sneaking coward&mdash;that
base wretch, who was a partner in my iniquity,
and who abandoned me to my fate, doubtless hoping
that a halter would end my days, and for ever rid
him of me.”</p>

<p>“But you loved not that man, according to all I
have ever heard you say upon the subject,” returned
Laura; “whereas,” she added, in a tone of transitory
softness, “I did&mdash;yes&mdash;I <em>did</em> love Charles
Hatfield.”</p>

<p>“Granted the difference!” ejaculated Mrs. Mortimer;
“and yet, even making every possible allowance
for that, there is still room enough to admit
the existence of my bitter hostility against Torrens.
What! was I not arrested the other day&mdash;dragged
ignominiously back to London&mdash;compelled to sleep
in a prison; and forced to appear at the bar of
justice,&mdash;and all on account of <em>his</em> crime! He
reaped the benefit&mdash;I the inconvenience, the fear,
the exposure, and the disgrace! It is true that I
never loved him&mdash;never even liked him;&mdash;true, also,
that ours was a marriage of convenience&mdash;both
suspecting, despising, and abhorring each other.
From the very first, then, I was his enemy; and
ever since I have cherished an undying animosity
against him.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, I shall not attempt to interfere
with your vengeance any more than you will seek
to mar the progress of mine. You have given me
an explanation of your views; and it is now my
turn to speak. This morning,” continued Laura,
“my hopes were suddenly defeated, and my golden
dreams dissipated by the appearance of Mr. Hatfield.
At half-past eleven o’clock, I found myself
deserted by him whom I had loved, and alone as it
were in a strange city. I instantly made up my
mind not to yield to sorrow or give way to grief;
and when a woman, placed in such circumstances,
will not permit her tender feelings to get the better
of her pride&mdash;when, in fact, she takes refuge in that
very pride against the poignancy of sorrow&mdash;she
necessarily conceives thoughts of vengeance. For
the pride which becomes her defence and her shield
in such a case, must be vindicated. I therefore
determined to cherish this hope of vengeance, and
gratify that hope when the proper time shall come.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
But, in the interval&mdash;and first of all&mdash;I must create
a brilliant social position for myself. On these
matters I reflected seriously this morning, so soon
as Charles and his father had taken their departure.
Then, to a certain extent, I made a confidant of my
French lady’s-maid, who has already become deeply
attached to me, and in whom I speedily discovered a
spirit of intrigue and a shrewd disposition. At the
same time, I told her nothing more than was absolutely
necessary to account for the abrupt departure
of Charles and my change of name; and
even those explanations which I did give her were
not entirely true. In a word, I acted with caution,
while I secured her fidelity and devotion to my
interests. Having thus come to a certain understanding,
as it were, we repaired to an agency-office,
kept by an Englishman, and made inquiries for
furnished apartments in a fashionable neighbourhood.
The agent conducted us hither: I inspected
the suite&mdash;approved of it&mdash;paid a half-year’s rent in
advance&mdash;and removed into my new abode, where
you now find me, at about three o’clock this afternoon.”</p>

<div id="i_193" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“You have lost no time in settling yourself thus
far, at all events,” observed Mrs. Mortimer.
“But proceed: you have more yet to explain to
me.”</p>

<p>“Only to observe that <em>your</em> aid is now required,
mother, to help me to that brilliant position which
I am determined to reach, and the attainment of
which will render us independent for the remainder
of our days.”</p>

<p>“My aid and assistance you shall have, Laura&mdash;aye,
and effectually too,” returned the old woman,
with difficulty concealing the joy and triumph which
she experienced on finding herself thus again appealed
to as a means to work out a grand design:
“but a fortnight’s delay will not prejudice your
scheme. You will not lose one particle of your
beauty in that time: on the contrary, you will
recover your wonted hues of health&mdash;for your cheeks
are somewhat pale this evening, and there is a blueish
tint around your eyes. Doubtless,” she added,
with a slightly malicious grin, “Charles Hatfield
was a husband to you in everything save the indissoluble
bonds!”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Laura, with an effrontery so cool,
so complete, that, had the old woman been questioning
her daughter on suspicion only, and not
on a verified certainty, she would have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
satisfied with that laconic, but emphatic negative.</p>

<p>“Ah! then your maudlin sentimentalism did
not render you altogether pliant and docile to the
impetuous passions of that handsome young man?”
she observed.</p>

<p>“Believing that we were to be married,” answered
Laura, “I necessarily refrained from compromising
myself in his estimation. But wherefore these
questions, mother?”&mdash;and again the fine large eyes of
the young woman were fixed searchingly on Mrs.
Mortimer’s countenance.</p>

<p>“I had no particular motive in putting those
queries,” was the response, apparently delivered off
hand, but in reality well weighed and measured,
as was every word that the artful old creature uttered
upon this occasion. “I was merely curious
to learn whether your prudence or your naturally
voluptuous temperament had prevailed in the strong
wrestle that must have taken place between those
feelings, while you were travelling and dwelling
alone with a handsome young man whom you almost
adored.”</p>

<p>“Not quite alone, mother,” exclaimed Laura, impatiently.
“Rosalie was with us.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the French lady’s maid, who is so shrewd
in disposition, and who manifests such an admirable
capacity for intrigue!” cried the old woman, unable
to resist the opportunity of bantering her daughter
a little, in revenge for the cool insults which she
herself had received at the hands of that daughter
during the last few days of their sojourn in England.</p>

<p>“Mother, have you sought me out only to revive
a certain bitterness of feeling which you so recently
studied to provoke between us!” demanded Laura,
her countenance flushing with indignation; and
when she had ceased speaking, she bit her under-lip
with her pearly teeth.</p>

<p>“No, no: we will not dispute,” said Mrs. Mortimer.
“But you must admit that I warned you
not to dream of marriage with that Charles Hatfield;
and, had you followed my advice, and stayed
in London, you might have retained him as a
lover&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let us not talk of the past,” interrupted Laura,
with an imperiousness of manner which warned her
mother not to provoke her farther. “The present
is assured, and we are at least independent; but
the future is before us&mdash;and <em>there</em> is the sphere in
which my hopes are soaring.”</p>

<p>“To return, then, to the point whence I ere now
diverged,” resumed Mrs. Mortimer, “I will repeat
my assertion that one fortnight’s delay will not mar
your plans. On the contrary, you will obtain physical
rest after the fatigues of travelling, and mental
composure after the excitement of recent occurrences.
Your charms will be enhanced, and you
will thereby become the more irresistible. This
fortnight’s interval I require for my own purposes,
as just now explained to you; and, whatever be
the result of my search after Torrens, I pledge myself
that, if alive and in health, I will return to you
in the evening of the fourteenth day from the present
date.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” exclaimed Laura. “You purpose,
therefore, to retrace your way to London!”</p>

<p>“Such is my intention. A night’s rest will be
sufficient to recruit my strength,” continued Mrs.
Mortimer; “and to-morrow morning I shall depart.”</p>

<p>“Now let us thoroughly understand each other,
and in no way act without a previous constitution
and agreement,” said Laura. “You are about to
return to the English metropolis, and it may happen
that you will encounter Charles Hatfield. It is my
wish that you avoid him&mdash;that you do not appear
even to notice him; and, for the same reasons which
urge me to give you this recommendation, I must
request that you attempt no extortion with his
father&mdash;that you will not seek to render available
or profitable the knowledge you possess of the
private affairs of that family. Were you to act contrary
to my wishes in this respect, you would only
mar the projects which I have formed to ensure
the eventual gratification of my vengeance.”</p>

<p>“I have listened to you with attention,” said the
old woman, “because I would not irritate you by
interruption. The counsel you have given me was,
however, quite unnecessary. My sole object in
visiting London is connected with Torrens; and
were I to behold Charles Hatfield at a distance, I
should avoid him rather than throw myself in his
way. His father I know not even by sight. Besides,
according to the tacit understanding which
appeared to establish itself between you and me
just now, we are mutually to forbear from interfering
in each other’s special affairs; and on this
basis, good feelings will permanently exist between
us. On my return to Paris, fourteen days hence,
I shall devote myself to the object which you have
in view; and rest assured that, ere long, some
wealthy, amorous, and docile nobleman&mdash;English
or French, no matter which&mdash;shall be languishing
at your feet.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it is for you to find out the individual to
be enchained; and it will then be for me to enchain
him,” cried Laura, her countenance lighting up
with the glow of anticipated triumph.</p>

<p>The mother and daughter thus made their
arrangements, and settled their plans in an amicable
fashion; and the former, after passing the night at
the handsome lodgings which Laura occupied, set
out in the morning on her journey back to London.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We must here pause, for a brief space, to explain
the sentiments and motives that respectively influenced
these designing women during the lengthy
discourse above recorded.</p>

<p>We have already stated, that even before Mrs.
Mortimer found herself in the presence of her
daughter, her suspicions and her curiosity were excited
by two or three mysterious though trivial incidents
that occurred; and she had not been many
minutes in Laura’s company, before she acquired
the certainty that the young woman intended to
conceal the fact of her marriage with Charles Hatfield.
Mrs. Mortimer at first fancied that this
desire arose from shame on the part of Laura,
whose pride might naturally revolt from the idea
of avowing that, in her eagerness to secure the
hand of a nobleman, she had only linked herself indissolubly
to a simple commoner, of illegitimate
birth, and entirely dependent on his father. But,
as the conversation embraced ampler details, and
exhibited views more positive and minute, Mrs.
Mortimer perceived that Laura was not influenced
by wounded pride and shame only in concealing
the fact of her marriage; but that, as she contemplated
<em>another</em> matrimonial alliance, as soon as
an opportunity for an eligible match should present
itself she was unwilling to allow her mother to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
attain the knowledge of a secret that would place
her so completely in that mother’s power.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Mortimer had accurately read the
thoughts and motives that were uppermost in
Laura’s mind. For, imagining from the observations
made, and the questions put by her mother,
that the fact of her marriage with Charles Hatfield
was indeed unknown to the old woman, she resolved
to cherish so important&mdash;so precious a secret.
Well aware of the despotic character and arbitrary
disposition of her parent, Laura chose to place
herself as little as possible at the mercy of one who
sought to rule with a rod of iron, and who was unscrupulous
and resolute to a degree in adopting
any means that might establish her sway over those
whom she aspired to controul.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” thought Laura within herself: “my
secret is safe&mdash;I am well assured of <em>that</em>;&mdash;and my
mother shall not penetrate it! The lips of Rosalie,
who alone could reveal it to her now, are
sealed by rich bribes. For such a secret in my
mother’s keeping would reduce me to the condition
of her slave! I should not dare to contract <em>another</em>
marriage; because her exigences would be backed
by a menace of exposure, and a prosecution for
bigamy: and by means of the terrorism which she
would thus exercise over me, I should become a
mere puppet in her hands&mdash;not daring to assert a
will of my own!”</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mrs. Mortimer’s thoughts
ran thus:&mdash;“Laura believes me to be ignorant of
her marriage, and my dissimulation shall confirm
her in that belief. Yes&mdash;I will act so as to lull her
into complete security on this point. It would be
of no use to me now to proclaim my knowledge of
the fact that the marriage <em>has</em> taken place; because,
at present, she requires my services, and will
be civil and courteous to me of her own accord.
But when once I shall have helped her to a wealthy
and titled husband, and when my aid shall no
longer be required, <em>then</em> she will re-assert her sway
and attempt to thrust <em>me</em> aside as a mere cypher!
But she shall find herself mistaken; and the secret
that I thus treasure up must prove the talisman
to give me despotic controul over herself, her husband,
her household,&mdash;aye, and her purse! Yes&mdash;yes:
she may marry now, without any opposition
from me. For, whereas in the former case her
marriage would indeed have reduced me to the
condition of a miserable dependant, a new alliance
will invest me with the power of a despot. Ah!
daughter&mdash;daughter, you have at length over-reached
yourself.”</p>

<p>And such was indeed the case; for so well did
Mrs. Mortimer play her part of deep dissimulation,
that Laura felt convinced her secret was safe, and
that the circumstance of her marriage was totally
unsuspected. And it was as much to confirm the
young woman in this belief, as for the purpose of
slyly bantering her, that the mother questioned her
as to the point to which her connexion with Charles
Hatfield had reached, and astutely placed in juxta-position
her daughter’s prudence on the one hand,
and voluptuousness of temperament on the other.
Thus Laura was completely duped, while secretly
triumphing in the belief that it was her parent who
was deceived!</p>

<p>We must, however, observe, that the two women,
under present circumstances, felt dependent on each
other in many and important respects; and this
mutual necessity rendered them easy to come to
terms and settle their affairs upon an amicable
basis.</p>

<p>On the one hand, Mrs. Mortimer relied upon her
daughter for pecuniary supplies; and this very circumstance
prompted her to undertake the journey
to London in the hope of finding Torrens, and extorting
from him the treasure of which, as she believed,
he had plundered Percival. The possession
of a few thousands of pounds, added to her knowledge
of Laura’s secret, would place her in a condition
of complete independence; and that independence
she would labour hard to achieve for herself.
But she might fail&mdash;and then she would again be
compelled to fall back on the resources of her
daughter. Thus, for the present at least, she <em>was</em>
in a state of dependence&mdash;and it was by no means
certain that her visit to London would change her
condition in this respect.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Laura was dependent on her
mother for aid in carrying out her ambitious views.
Ignorant of the French language as she was, she
could not hope to succeed by herself alone; and,
in intrigues which required so much delicacy of
management, she could not rely solely on a lady’s-maid.
The assistance of her mother was therefore
necessary; for she reflected that the astute old
woman who had succeeded in inducing Charles
Hatfield to accompany her to the lodgings in Suffolk-street,
could not fall to lead some wealthy and
amorous noble within the influence of her daughter’s
syren-charms in the Rue Monthabor.</p>

<p>We have now explained the exact position in
which these two designing women were placed with
regard to each other; and we must request our
readers to bear in mind all the observations which
we have just recorded, inasmuch as they afford a
clue to the motives of many transactions to be hereafter
narrated.</p>

<p>For the history of Laura is, as it were, only just
commenced; and the most startling, exciting, and
surprising incidents of her career have yet to be
told.</p>

<p>She was a woman of whom it may be well said,
“We ne’er shall look upon her like again!”</p>

<p>But the delineation of such a character as this
Perdita&mdash;or Laura, as we are henceforth to call her&mdash;has
the advantage of throwing into glorious contrast
the virtues, amenities, and endearing qualities
of woman generally,&mdash;inasmuch as she is a grand
and almost unique exception, proving the rule which
asserts the excellent qualities of her sex.</p>

<p>It was about five o’clock in the evening of the
second day after the incidents just related, that the
Earl of Ellingham received a note, the address of
which was written in a feigned hand, and with the
word “private” marked in the corner.</p>

<p>The messenger, who left it at the mansion in
Pall-mall, had departed immediately his errand was
discharged, and without waiting for any reply.</p>

<p>Lord Ellingham happened to be alone in the
library when the missive was placed in his hands,
and on opening it he recognised the writing of his
half-brother; for the address only was disguised&mdash;a
precaution adopted in case the letter should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
observed by the ladies before it reached the hands
of the earl.</p>

<p>The contents convoyed a brief intimation that
Mr. Hatfield had returned to London with his son,
and that they had put up temporarily at the Trafalgar
Hotel, Spring-gardens, where the presence of
the nobleman was anxiously expected.</p>

<p>Thither the earl accordingly repaired, and a
waiter conducted him to an apartment, in which he
was received by his half-brother alone&mdash;the father
having deemed it prudent that the son should not
be present while the necessary explanations were
being given.</p>

<p>The meeting between the nobleman and Mr.
Hatfield was cordial, and even affectionate: how
different from that of the mother and daughter in
Paris, as described in the preceding chapter!</p>

<p>“You have recovered your son, Thomas,” said the
earl; “and under any circumstances I congratulate
you. The fact that he has returned to London with
you convinces me that the paternal authority is
once more recognised.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;he is here&mdash;in an adjacent room, Arthur,”
replied Mr. Hatfield. “I thought it prudent, for
many reasons, to send for you privately, and consult
you before I ventured to take him back to his
mother’s presence. Indeed I know not, after all
that has occurred, whether you will permit him to
cross your threshold again&mdash;whether you can ever
forgive him.”</p>

<p>“He is your son, Thomas, and that is sufficient,”
interrupted the generous, noble-hearted earl.
“Whatever he may have done, I promise to pardon
him: however gravely he may have erred, I will
yield him my forgiveness. Nay, more&mdash;I will undertake
to promise the same for my wife, who you
know is not a woman that harbours rancour.”</p>

<p>“The amiable, the excellent Esther! Oh! no,
no&mdash;she would not refuse pardon or sympathy to a
living soul!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield. “And you,
my generous brother&mdash;my never-failing friend&mdash;how
can I sufficiently thank you for these assurances
which you give me, and which so materially
tend to lighten the sorrow that weighs upon my
heart! I have suffered and undergone much during
the few days of my absence from London.”</p>

<p>“But you have recovered your son,” hastily interrupted
the earl, pressing his half-brother’s hand
with a fervour that was indeed consolatory; “and
I am sure that, although his errors may have been
great, he has not committed any thing dishonourable.
He may have been self-willed&mdash;rebellious
against the paternal authority&mdash;ungrateful&mdash;unmindful
of those who wish him well; he may have
yielded himself up to the wiles of an infamous woman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All that has he assuredly done, Arthur,” said
Mr. Hatfield, in a melancholy tone; “and more
still! For, as you yourself suspected on that day
when we made so many distressing discoveries in
the library, he found out who I <em>was</em>&mdash;who I <em>am</em>,&mdash;he
believed himself to be my legitimate son&mdash;he even
raised money by the name of <em>Viscount Marston</em>&mdash;he
dared to contemplate measures to force me to assume
<em>your</em> title, and claim <em>your</em> estates; and he
would have sacrificed you&mdash;me&mdash;his mother&mdash;the
countess&mdash;aye, and the amiable, excellent Frances&mdash;he
would have sacrificed us all,” added Mr. Hatfield,
profoundly excited, “to his inordinate ambition!
Now, my dear Arthur,” he asked, in a
milder and more measured tone&mdash;“<em>now</em>, can you
forgive my son all this?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and more&mdash;ten thousand times more!”
ejaculated the earl, emphatically. “Had he possessed
the right to accomplish all he devised&mdash;aye,
had he carried out his designs to the very end&mdash;even
then, Thomas, would I have forgiven him for your
sake.”</p>

<p>“It is a god&mdash;an angel who speaks thus; and not
a mere human being!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield, embracing
his half-brother with an enthusiasm and a
fervour amounting almost to a worship. “Oh!
why are not all men like you?&mdash;the world would
then know not animosity, nor rancour, nor strife;
and earth would be heaven!”</p>

<p>“Thomas, Thomas,” cried the earl, reproachfully,
“attach not too much importance to a feeling on
my part which you yourself would show under
similar circumstances! But let us speak of your
son. He has erred, and you have forgiven him&mdash;you,
his father, who are the most deeply wounded
by his temporary ingratitude, have pardoned him and
taken him again to your heart. Shall not I, then,
who look upon him in the light of a nephew&mdash;shall not
I, an uncle, forgive and forget what a father can pardon
and obliterate from his memory? Yes&mdash;and I
will even find extenuating circumstances in his
favour: I will search out and conjure up excuses
for him! Endowed with an enthusiastic disposition&mdash;an
ardent longing to render himself conspicuous
in the world&mdash;a fervid craving to earn distinction
and acquire a proud name,&mdash;he paused not
to reflect whether it were well to shine with an
adventitious lustre, or to win for himself and by
himself the glory that should encircle his brow.
The splendid career of the Prince of Montoni
dazzled&mdash;nay, almost blinded him; and while he
contemplated the eminence on which that illustrious
personage stands, he forgot that his Royal
Highness obtained not rank and power by hereditary
right, but by his great deeds, his steady perseverance
in the course of rectitude, and his ennobling
virtues. While filled with lofty aspirations, your
son suddenly made the discovery of certain family
secrets which appeared to place a title within his
reach. Ah! pardon him if he stretched out his
hand to grasp the visionary coronet,&mdash;pardon him,
I say&mdash;and wonder not if in the eagerness of his
desire to clutch the dreamy bauble, he thrust
parents, relatives, and friends rudely aside.”</p>

<p>“The generosity which prompts you to extenuate
his grievous faults shall not be cooled nor marred
by any opposite opinion on my part,” said Mr. Hatfield.
“And, my God! is he not my son?&mdash;and
have I not already&mdash;yes, already&mdash;while we were
still in Paris&mdash;promised to forgive him every thing.
But when I think of all the misery his insane ambition
would have brought upon you and yours&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! the loss of title and wealth would not
interfere with my happiness, Thomas,” interrupted
the earl, smiling.</p>

<p>“And that loss you cannot now sustain&mdash;no&mdash;never,
never!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield, impetuously;
“and I thank God that I am enabled to give you
this assurance! For the papers&mdash;the fatal papers&mdash;the
family documents, are all burnt&mdash;burnt with
my own hand, and in the presence of that young
man who dared to take them from the secret recess
where you had deposited them.”</p>

<p>“Ere now you called me generous, Thomas,”
said the earl,&mdash;“and for the performance of a common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
Christian duty&mdash;I mean, the forgiveness of
one who has offended and who is penitent. But
you, my brother&mdash;what generosity have you not
shown towards me,&mdash;yes&mdash;and for years&mdash;long
years;&mdash;and now, to crown it all, you have destroyed
those evidences which would make you
great at any moment. Oh! as the world’s ambition
goes, and as human hearts are constituted, <em>your</em>
generosity outvalues <em>mine</em> as immeasurably as the
boundless Pacific exceeds the stagnant puddle in
the street!”</p>

<p>And, as the earl spoke these words with an enthusiasm
and a sincerity that came from the inmost
recesses of his heart, he dashed away a tear.</p>

<p>Then, as if suddenly animated by the same sentiment&mdash;a
sentiment of mutual regard, devotion, and
admiration,&mdash;the half-brothers grasped each other’s
hands; and the pressure was long and fervid&mdash;a
profound silence reigning between them the while,&mdash;for,
men of years and worldly experience though
they were, their souls’ emotions were deeply stirred
and their finest feelings were aroused.</p>

<p>“I have not yet told you all&mdash;perhaps scarcely
even the worst, relative to my unfortunate son,”
said Mr. Hatfield, after a long pause. “That vile
woman of whom Villiers spoke&mdash;that Perdita
Slingsby&mdash;or Torrens&mdash;or Fitzhardinge&mdash;whichever
her name may be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! I understand you already,” interrupted
the earl, in a tone of deep commiseration: “the
artful creature has inveigled your son into a hasty
marriage. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Alas! it is too true, Arthur,” said Mr. Hatfield;
and he then proceeded to narrate to his brother all
that had occurred during his absence from London,&mdash;the
accident near Greenwich&mdash;the adventure with
the officers at Dover&mdash;the interview with his son in
Paris&mdash;the negotiations with Perdita&mdash;and the
terms which he had finally settled with that designing
woman.</p>

<p>“Oh! that you had been one day earlier,”
exclaimed Lord Ellingham; “and this odious marriage
would not have occurred. It is lamentable
indeed, Thomas&mdash;and the more so, in consequence
of the hopes that I had founded on the attachment
which until lately existed between Charles and my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it is that&mdash;it is <em>that</em> which cuts me to the
very soul!” cried Mr. Hatfield, with exceeding bitterness
of tone and manner.</p>

<p>“And yet there is hope&mdash;there is hope for us
yet!” exclaimed the earl, who, after pacing the
room in deep thought for a few minutes, turned suddenly
towards his half-brother.</p>

<p>“Hope do you say?” demanded the latter, his
countenance brightening up&mdash;though he could not
as yet conjecture, much less perceive the source
whence the gleam of hope could possibly emanate.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;hope,” repeated the earl emphatically,
but sinking his voice almost to a whisper, as if he
were afraid that the very walls should hear the
words he was uttering. “Did not that woman tell
you she should contract <em>another marriage</em>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She assuredly intimated as much,” answered
Mr. Hatfield; “and by her words and manner I
have no doubt that the intention was uppermost in
her mind.”</p>

<p>“And from the knowledge which we now possess
of her character,” added the earl, “we may
rest satisfied that she will not refuse the first good
offer that presents itself. Well, then&mdash;on the day
that she contracts another marriage, Charles may
consider himself absolved from the alliance which
he so unhappily formed.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I comprehend you, my dear Arthur!”
exclaimed Mr. Hatfield, his heart already feeling
lighter. “But the legal tie will still exist,” he
added an instant afterwards, his voice again becoming
solemn and mournful.</p>

<p>“The law is an unnatural&mdash;a vile&mdash;and a miserable
one, which would for ever exclude either that
woman or your son from the portals of the matrimonial
temple!” said the earl, speaking with impassioned
emphasis, though still in a subdued tone,
“Charles has discarded her&mdash;and she has consented
never more to molest him. Already, then, are they
severed in a moral point of view. But should that
woman contract another marriage&mdash;take unto herself
another husband&mdash;and thereby prove that her
severance from the young man whom she ensnared
and inveigled, is complete,&mdash;should she adopt the
initiative in that respect, it would be a despicable
fastidiousness and a contemptible affectation on the
part of any one to say to Charles Hatfield, ‘<em>You
must never know matrimonial happiness: but you
must remain in your present false position, a husband
without a wife, for the remainder of your days!</em>’ It
were inhuman&mdash;base&mdash;and unnatural thus to address
your son, when once the woman herself shall
have ratified by her actions that compact which her
words and her signature have already sanctioned.
Were a father to consult me under such circumstances,
and ask my advice whether he should bestow
his daughter on a young man situated as your
son will then be,&mdash;my counsel would be entirely in
the affirmative. Can you therefore suppose for a
moment that I shall shrink from acting in accordance
with the advice I should assuredly give to another
man who is likewise a father? No&mdash;no!
If then, in the course of time, this Perdita shall
contract a new marriage,&mdash;and if your son manifest,
as I hope and believe he will do, contrition for the
past&mdash;if his conduct be such as to afford sure guarantees
for the future&mdash;and if his attachment for
Frances should revive, as I am certain that hers,
poor girl! will continue unimpaired,&mdash;under all
these circumstances, Thomas, I should not consider
myself justified in stamping the unhappiness of
that pair by refusing my consent to their union.”</p>

<p>“Most solemnly do I assure you, Arthur,” exclaimed
Mr. Hatfield, “that, as an impartial person,
and supposing I were disinterested in the matter, I
should view it precisely in the same light: but I
should not have dared to express those sentiments
before you, had you not been the first to give utterance
to them.”</p>

<p>“It is, after all, the mere common-sense aspect of
the question,” said the earl. “A young man is inveigled
into a marriage with a woman whom he looks
upon as an angel of purity; and in a few hours he
discovers her to be a demon of pollution. They
separate upon positive and written conditions. The
tribunals would take cognizance of the affair, and
grant a legal divorce were they appealed to: but
a private arrangement is deemed preferable to a
public scandal. Well, the woman marries again&mdash;and
every remaining shadow of claim which she
might still have had upon the individual whom she
had entrapped and deluded, ceases at once. The
complete snapping of the bond&mdash;the total severance
of the tie, is her own doing. It is true that the
law may proclaim the first marriage to be the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
legal one: but morality revolts against such an
unnatural averment. These are my solemn convictions;&mdash;and,
were I to ponder upon them for a
hundred years, I should not waver one tittle in my
belief.”</p>

<p>“There is more injustice committed by a false
morality&mdash;more unhappiness inflicted by a ridiculous
fastidiousness, than the world generally would
believe,” observed Mr. Hatfield.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and there is another consideration which
weighs with me, Thomas!” exclaimed the earl,
turning once more, and now with a smiling countenance,
towards his half-brother. “You have
shewn so much generosity towards me&mdash;you have
annihilated documents which ninety-nine men out
of a hundred would have prized and availed themselves
of&mdash;and you have exhibited so much noble
feeling in all your actions respecting myself and our
family honour, that I consider myself bound to
effect the union of my daughter and your son, if
it be practicable. This, then, I propose&mdash;that the
unfortunate marriage of Charles shall be kept a
profound secret, and that he shall leave England
for a short time, so that active employment may
completely and radically wean his mind from any
lingering attachment that he may entertain for the
polluted Perdita. With regard to this latter suggestion
I have a project which I will presently explain
to you. Respecting the maintenance of the
secret of his unhappy marriage, I should recommend
its propriety even were there no ulterior considerations
of the nature already stated. For of
what avail can it be to distress my wife or yours&mdash;much
less my daughter&mdash;by a revelation of the sad
circumstance? In any case, Frances would not
be permitted to learn that secret; and I should be
loth indeed to afflict Lady Ellingham by the narration
of such a history.”</p>

<p>“And you may be wall assured, Arthur,” observed
Mr. Hatfield, “that it would prove no pleasant
task for me to inform Lady Georgiana that
her son, by his mad ambition and his fatal misconceptions,
had compelled me to make known to him
the fact of his illegitimacy. Neither should I wish
to distress her by unfolding to her the secret of this
most miserable marriage.”</p>

<p>“It is fortunate that we were so guarded with
our wives on that morning when we made such
alarming discoveries in the library,” observed Lord
Ellingham: “it is a subject for self-congratulation
that we merely intimated the fact of Charles’s departure
that day with an abandoned woman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and it was to your prudent representations
that I yielded, when I was about to commit
the folly of imparting every thing to my wife,&mdash;the
loss of the papers&mdash;the certainty that Charles had
not only taken them, but had likewise discovered
every thing relating to my own past life&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was scarcely my advice, Thomas, which prevented
you from making all those revelations to
Georgiana,” said the earl: “but it was when&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I remember: it was when we resolved to
depart in search of the fugitive, that I found my wife
was so overcome by the first word I uttered&mdash;the
word which told her he was gone&mdash;that I could
not feel it in my heart to afflict her by farther revelations.”</p>

<p>“You scarcely require to be informed that Villiers
and myself each pursued the road that we respectively
took, until we acquired the certainty that
no travellers of the description given had passed
that way; but it was late at night when I returned
to London, and Villiers was an hour or two later
still. While we are, however, conversing in this
desultory manner,” said the earl, “we forget that
Charles is waiting for us in another room.”</p>

<p>“And you forget, my dear Arthur,” observed Mr.
Hatfield, “that you have a project respecting him,
but which you have not as yet revealed to me.”</p>

<p>“True!” ejaculated Lord Ellingham; “and the
explanation can be speedily given. Yesterday afternoon
I received a hastily written note from the
Prince of Montoni, stating the melancholy intelligence
that his illustrious father-in-law, Alberto I.,
expired after a short illness twelve days ago. The
Prince received the news yesterday morning by special
courier&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And he is now Grand Duke of Castelcicala?”
exclaimed Mr. Hatfield.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;he is a sovereign prince,” returned the
nobleman,&mdash;“and one who will not only make his
people happy, but who, I venture to predict, will be
the means of regenerating Italy. His Sovereign
Highness departs to-morrow for Castelcicala; and,
although it be scarcely consistent with propriety to
accost him with a request under such circumstances,
yet I will do so&mdash;trusting that the explanations
which I shall give, may excuse the apparent
importunity at the present moment.”</p>

<p>“And that request?” said Mr. Hatfield, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Is that the Grand Duke&mdash;for by this proud title
must we now denominate him&mdash;will permit Charles
to accompany him in the capacity of one of his <em>aides-de-camp</em>.
Your son can speak the Italian language
as fluently as his own; and his long residence in
Castelcicala will have fitted him for the situation
I propose to procure for him. Moreover, that aspiring
nature&mdash;that ardent ambition which has
already manifested itself, will be gratified and will
find congenial associations and emulative stimulants
In the career thus opened to him. If his ambition,
in its first strugglings, have unfortunately
led him into error, it was on account of the misconceptions
to which he yielded, and the baleful
influence which a designing woman exercised over
him: but, with such a glorious example before him
as the illustrious personage into whose service I
propose that he shall enter, and keeping in view
such legitimate aims as that service naturally suggests,
I am much deceived indeed if your son do
not prove himself a good, an estimable, and, perhaps,
a great man.”</p>

<p>“Your advice is as excellent as your purpose is
generous and kind,” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield, overjoyed
at the prospects thus held out.</p>

<p>“We may now release Charles,” said the earl,
“from the suspense which he is doubtless enduring.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hatfield left the room, and shortly afterwards
returned, accompanied by the young man, whose
face was pale and whose looks were downcast, as
he advanced towards the earl.</p>

<p>“My dear Charles,” said the good nobleman, embracing
him,&mdash;“not a word relative to the past!
All is forgiven&mdash;all forgotten, as far as the memory
<em>can</em> forget.”</p>

<p>Charles shed tears, while his heart was agitated
with many conflicting emotions,&mdash;gratitude for the
assurance thus given to him&mdash;joy that he was so
completely pardoned&mdash;bitter regret that he should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
have ever contemplated aught prejudicial to the
interests of the generous earl&mdash;vexation on account
of the facility with which he had been led astray&mdash;and
shame at the deplorable errors he had committed.</p>

<p>But when he heard the kind, affectionate, and
re-assuring language addressed to him alike by his
father and Lord Ellingham,&mdash;when he learnt that
the main particulars of his late proceedings were
to be kept a solemn secret in respect to his mother,
the countess, and Lady Frances,&mdash;and when he
was made acquainted with the project which the
earl had suggested relative to placing him about
the person of the idol of his heroic worship&mdash;the
new Grand Duke of Castelcicala,&mdash;a genial tide of
consolation was poured into his soul; and he felt
that the future might yet teem with bright hopes
for him!</p>

<p>But not a word was breathed either by Mr. Hatfield
or Lord Ellingham respecting <em>that other prospect</em>
which had evoked so much enlightened reasoning
and such liberal sentiments from the lips of the
earl: we mean the probability of a marriage eventually
taking place between the young man and the
beautiful Lady Frances Ellingham.</p>

<p>With the proposal that he should enter the service
of the Grand Duke, Charles was delighted;
and the earl promised to visit his Sovereign Highness
early in the morning, at Markham Place, to
proffer the request which he had to make as the
necessary preliminary.</p>

<p>The nobleman, Mr. Hatfield, and Charles now
repaired to the mansion in Pall Mall, where the
presence of the two latter, especially of the last-mentioned,
caused feelings of joy which we must
leave the reader to imagine.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLVII">CHAPTER CLVII.<br />

<span class="medium">POLITICAL OBSERVATIONS.&mdash;THE DEPARTURE OF
CHARLES HATFIELD.</span></h2>

<p>Yes&mdash;it was true that the Prince of Montoni
had become Grand Duke of Castelcicala; and those
who have read the First Series of “<span class="smcap">The Mysteries
of London</span>,” have now traced the career of Richard
Markham from the period of his obscure boyhood
until the time when his brow is circled by a sovereign
crown!</p>

<p>And when we reflect that it was a <span class="smcap">Revolution</span>
which evoked his brilliant qualities as a warrior
and a statesman,&mdash;when we call to mind the fact
that it was the cry of “<span class="smcap">Liberty</span>” which became
the watch-word of his achievements and the herald
of his triumphs,&mdash;we cannot do otherwise, on reaching
this point in our narrative, than avail ourselves
of so fitting an opportunity to notice the grand and
glorious struggle that has so lately taken place in
the capital of France.</p>

<p>Oh! the French are a fine people, and are destined
to teach the world some signal lessons in the
school of <span class="smcap">Political Freedom</span>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People of England!</span> accord your sympathies&mdash;your
best and most generous sympathies&mdash;to that
gallant Parisian population which has so recently
dethroned a miscreant Monarch, and hurled an
execrable Ministry from the seat of power!</p>

<p>Let the English Sons of Toil&mdash;oppressed, ground
down by taxation, half-starved, and deprived of
their electoral rights as they are,&mdash;let the Industrious
Classes of the British Islands, trampled upon
and made tools of by the wealthy <em>few</em> as we know
them to be,&mdash;let <em>them</em> do honour, at least by words
to the working men of France who have dared to
expel a demon-hearted tyrant and his bravo-hirelings.</p>

<p>The States of Italy&mdash;Bavaria&mdash;and France have
all, within the last few weeks, manifested their
scorn and contempt for the doctrine of “the divine
right of kings;”&mdash;the <span class="smcap">People</span> in those realms have
exercised the power which they possess:&mdash;the cause
has been righteous&mdash;the despots have yielded&mdash;and
<em>one</em> has been overthrown altogether.</p>

<p>For the cause is always righteous when the
People seek to wrest from their rulers that freedom
which has been basely usurped, and which the tyrannical
oligarchy refuses to surrender by fair means
to the millions.</p>

<p>It is a monstrous absurdity and a hideous mockery
to prate of treason, and sedition, and rebellion, when
a people rises up in its might and its power to demand
the privileges which are naturally its own.</p>

<p>The <em>few</em> cannot possibly possess an inherent or
hereditary right to enslave the <em>many</em>: nor is the present
generation to be bound by the enactments of
the preceding one. If that preceding one chose to
have a Monarchy, the present one is justified in declaring
its will that a Republic shall exist;&mdash;and so
long as the great majority of the inhabitants of a
country are of accord in this respect, they have a
right to upset the existing government at any moment
and establish another. Nay, more; we will
assert that the people need not even be wise or
prudent in order to legitimatise their actions:&mdash;the
great majority may act as they think fit, although
they should be unwise or imprudent in respect to
the institutions they choose to build up!</p>

<p>We are averse to the exercise of physical force;&mdash;but
France has shown that when moral agitation
fails, violence <em>must</em> be used;&mdash;and if freedom can be
gained by the loss of a few drops of blood&mdash;why,
then those drops should be shed cheerfully.</p>

<p>Suppose that in any country the great majority
of the people sign a document addressed to the
sovereign in these terms:&mdash;“We are very much
obliged to you for having reigned over us hitherto;
but we do not require your services farther. It
pleases us to establish another form of government
and raise up another ruler; and therefore we request
you to descend from the throne and surrender
up the power delegated to you.” Were the sovereign
to refuse compliance with this demand, then force
should be used; and all the antiquated farces of
“hereditary rights,” and “treason,” and “sedition,”
and such-like nonsense, would of course be disregarded
by an insurgent people.</p>

<p>On the other hand, so long as a nation remains
tranquil, and addresses to the sovereign no demand
of the kind supposed above, that sovereign may
continue to occupy the throne, as the people’s executive
magistrate; for it is the fault of the
millions themselves if they be foolish enough to
tolerate either a king or a queen.</p>

<p>Republicanism is the “order of the day;” and
there is not a throne in Europe that is worth
twenty years’ purchase,&mdash;no&mdash;not even that of the
Austrian Kaiser or the Muscovite Czar;&mdash;and from
the banks of the Thames to the confines of Asia&mdash;from
the cheerless regions of the North to the
sunny shores of the tideless Mediterranean, the
prevailing sentiment is adverse to the antiquated,
useless, oppressive institutions of Monarchy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honour To the Great and Glorious French
Nation!</span> And let the Royalty which still exists in
England beware how it caress, and pet, and openly
sympathise with the ex-Royalty which has taken
refuge on this soil. For the Queen of England to
adopt such a course, were to offer a gross and
flagrant insult to the people of France, and inevitably
provoke a war. Besides&mdash;is not Louis-Philippe
a miscreant deserving universal execration? Did
he not calmly and deliberately calculate upon
butchering the brave Parisian people, in order to
consolidate the power of his despot-throne? Are
not his hands imbrued with blood? No sympathy,
then&mdash;no pity for this royal Greenacre&mdash;this horrible
assassin!</p>

<p>And were he to be received at the palace of our
Queen, the insult would not only be monstrous
towards the French people, who have expelled him,
but equally great towards the English people, who
abhor tyrants, and who are generous, humane, and
merciful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Working Men of England!</span> rejoice and be
glad&mdash;for amidst the changes which have so recently
taken place in France, there is one “sign of
the times” that is cheering and full of prophetic
significancy for <em>you</em>! I allude to the grand&mdash;the
glorious fact, that in the list of the Provisional
Government which the Revolution raised up, these
words appeared&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Albert</span>, Working Man.”</p>

<p>Yes: a Working Man was included in that fine
category of Republican names; and he has been instrumental
in giving to the whole political world
that impulse which must inevitably conduct <em>even
the present generation</em> to the most glorious destinies.</p>

<p>Honour to Albert, the Working Man!</p>

<p>There is another point on which I must touch,
ere I resume the thread of my narrative.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister of England has declared
“that he has no intention whatever to interfere
with the form of government which the French
nation may choose for themselves.” He therefore
admits the right of the nation to establish any form
of government which it chooses;&mdash;and this concession
is an important one, when coming from the
principal adviser of the Queen, and from a man who
is, after all, nothing more nor less than the chief
of an aristocratic clique.</p>

<p>Well, then&mdash;it being admitted by the Prime
Minister that a nation has a right to choose its own
form of government, the sooner the people of England
begin to think of establishing new institutions
for themselves, the better. For there is no use in
disguising the fact&mdash;and no possibility of exaggerating
it,&mdash;that England is in a truly awful condition.
Already are we enduring a war-tax; and it
was only through fear of seeing the glorious example
of the Parisians immediately followed by the
inhabitants of London, that the Ministers abandoned
their iniquitous and execrable scheme of
doubling that shameful impost. But the financial
ignorance and the wanton extravagance of the
Whigs have plunged the country into serious pecuniary
embarrassments, from which nothing but the
sweeping reform of a purely democratic Ministry
can relieve it. With a tremendous national debt,&mdash;with
no possibility of levying another tax,&mdash;with
Ireland to care for and almost support,&mdash;with a
vast amount of absolute penury and positive destitution
in the country,&mdash;with an aristocracy clinging
to old abuses, and with the land in the possession
of a contemptibly small oligarchy,&mdash;with the industrious
classes starving on pitiable wages,&mdash;with a
pension-list which is a curse and a shame,&mdash;with a
cumbrous and costly Monarchy,&mdash;with a Church
grasping at all it can possibly lay hands on,&mdash;with a
Bench of Bishops in inveterate and banded hostility
to all enlightening opinions and popular interests,&mdash;and
with a franchise so limited that nine-tenths of
the people are altogether unrepresented,&mdash;with all
these, and a thousand other evils which might be
readily enumerated, we repeat our assertion that
England is in an awful state; and we must add
that great, important, and radical changes must be
speedily effected.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Oh! how well and how truly has a great French
writer declared that “men have only to will it, in
order to be free!” France has set England and the
world a great and glorious example in this respect.</p>

<p>These English newspapers which are interested
in pandering to the prejudices and the selfishness
of a bloated aristocracy and an oppressive oligarchy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
of landowners, represent revolutions as scenes of
spoliation, social ruin, and other demoralisation.
But the incidents of the Revolution which gave
Louis Philippe a throne in 1830, and those of the
grand struggle which has just hurled him from his
despot-seat, give the lie&mdash;the bold, unequivocal lie&mdash;to
such statements.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>We now proceed with the thread of our narrative;
but it is not necessary to give at any length
the particulars of the interview which took place
between Lord Ellingham and Richard Markham,
now Grand Duke of Castelcicala. Suffice it to say,
that his Sovereign Highness, though deeply afflicted
by the news of his father-in-law’s demise, welcomed
the English nobleman with the utmost cordiality,
and immediately consented to receive Charles Hatfield
as one of his <em>aides-de-camp</em>. The Earl hastened
back to Pall-mall, and, sending for the young
man to his private apartment, reasoned with him
in an impressive way upon the necessity of retrieving
the past by the conduct which he should pursue
in future. Charles listened with profound attention
to all that the excellent peer said upon this occasion,
and promised that his behaviour should henceforth
render him worthy of all the signal favours
bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>The preparations for his departure were in the
meantime made with all possible despatch; and in
the course of a few hours Charles Hatfield took
leave of his family, and hastened to Markham Place,
to join the suite of the new Sovereign of
Castelcicala.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLVIII">CHAPTER CLVIII.<br />

<span class="medium">Mrs. Mortimer in London.</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer,&mdash;as we must now call her
whom we have already known as Mrs. Slingsby,
Mrs. Torrens, and Mrs. Fitzhardinge,&mdash;arrived in
London two days after the scene which took place
between her daughter and herself in the Rue
Monthabor at Paris.</p>

<p>The wily woman was intent upon accomplishing
the aim that had brought her back to the English
metropolis; but as the reader may well imagine,
she had not the least trace of her husband&mdash;nor the
slightest clue to his whereabout. Indeed, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
only a conjecture with her that he was in London
at all;&mdash;but she had worked this suspicion up into
a certainty in her own mind; and the object she
hoped to gain was quite important enough to lead
her to resolve upon leaving no stone unturned in
order to arrive at a successful issue.</p>

<p>On setting foot in the metropolis, she took up
her abode at a small coffee-house in an obscure
street in the Borough of Southwark; and having
assumed a somewhat mean attire, she repaired, in
the dusk of the evening after her arrival, to the
vicinity of the dwelling which in former times bore
the name of Torrens Cottage.</p>

<p>This house, as the reader will recollect, was
situate between Streatham and Norwood; and the
old woman, who knew the world well, and read the
human heart profoundly, calculated that Torrens,
impelled by that inscrutable and mysterious curiosity
which prompts persons under such circumstances,
was likely, if indeed in London, to visit
the neighbourhood where he had once dwelt, and
which had proved for him the scene of such dire
misfortune.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer knew that Torrens had passed
many happy days at that cottage, and had there
cherished the grandest hopes of acquiring a great
fortune by means of building-speculations: she
was also aware that he had at the same place bargained
for the sale of his daughter’s virtue&mdash;beheld
the ravisher lying murdered upon the sofa&mdash;and
been arrested on suspicion of the heinous crime.
The place, then, was replete with the most varied
and conflicting reminiscences for the old man; and
Mrs. Mortimer said to herself, “The morbid feelings
which must exist in such a heart as his, will
probably induce him to visit the neighbourhood of
the house that once was his home.”</p>

<p>Such was her calculation; and, acting upon this
impression, she sped on foot towards the dwelling
where she had once dwelt a few brief hours as the
wife of the man whom she was searching after.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock in the evening when she
turned into the lane where twenty years before
Tom Rain had robbed Frank Curtis of the two
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mrs. Mortimer came in sight of
the cottage, the walls of which were glistening
white amidst the summer evening semi-obscurity;
and her heart beat quickly as she thought of the long&mdash;long
time that had elapsed since she last saw that
spot where <em>she</em> also had been arrested on a capital
charge!</p>

<p>What changes&mdash;what vicissitudes had marked
her existence since that epoch!</p>

<p>She had been in Newgate, and had there given
birth to a daughter, who had accompanied her into
exile:&mdash;the daughter had grown up&mdash;had become
as profligate, though not altogether as criminal
as her mother&mdash;and had at length defied the
authority of that parent who thus surpassed her in
the extent of her iniquity!</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;many and striking had been the events
that had characterised the old woman’s career since
last she saw those white, glistening walls:&mdash;but
there was the cottage apparently unchanged in outward
appearance,&mdash;although it was more completely
hemmed in by trees than when she quitted it upwards
of nineteen years back.</p>

<p>For the large trees which were there in her time,
had grown larger, and the saplings had expanded
into trees also;&mdash;and a high, thick, verdant hedge
surrounded the garden.</p>

<p>“Ah!” thought the old woman to herself, as she
sped down the lane, “I could almost wish that the
cottage was mine, and that I might retire with a
competency to this sweet seclusion, no more to
commingle in the strife and turmoil of the great&mdash;the
busy&mdash;the jarring world. But this may not be!
My life is destined to be stormy until the end. I
feel that it is&mdash;and I must yield to the destiny that
urges me on!”</p>

<p>Melancholy sentiments had risen up in her soul
as she gave way to these thoughts; but their
current was suddenly cut short&mdash;or rather diverted
into another channel, when, emerging from the
lane, she found herself in front of the cottage.</p>

<p>A light was visible through the shutters of the
parlour&mdash;that very parlour where Sir Henry Courtenay
was murdered, and whither she herself was
borne in a fainting fit, after having been arrested in
the hall on a charge of forgery.</p>

<p>A cold shudder crept over the old wretch, hardened
and heartless as she was: for she remembered
all the acuteness&mdash;all the intensity of the anguish
she had experienced, when she had awakened to
consciousness on that dread occasion, and found
herself in the custody of the servitors of justice.</p>

<p>Exercising, however, a powerful control over her
feelings, she stepped up to the front-door, and
knocked boldly,&mdash;not in a sneaking, timid, uncertain
manner, but with firmness and decision.</p>

<p>The summons was almost immediately answered
by a pretty-looking, neatly-dressed, and very respectable
servant-maid of about eighteen or nineteen; and
Mrs. Mortimer’s eyes now commanded a view of
the hall where the constables had made her their
prisoner,&mdash;that fatal incident which became as it
were an ominous and most conspicuous finger-post
in the road of her chequered existence!</p>

<p>“Can I be permitted, without causing inconvenience,
to speak a few words to your master or
mistress?” inquired Mrs. Mortimer, subduing the
feelings aroused by the reminiscences of the past,
and addressing herself to the business of the present.</p>

<p>“Surely you must have made some mistake,”
said the servant-girl, speaking, however, in a mild
and respectful tone. “No gentleman resides here.”</p>

<p>“Then allow me to see your mistress, young
woman,” persisted Mrs. Mortimer, slipping two
half-crowns into the maid’s hand.</p>

<p>“I will carry your message to my mistress,” said
the domestic coldly, and at the same time indignantly
repulsing the proffered bribe. “Walk in, if
you please.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer entered the hall; and as the light
of the lamp suspended to the ceiling now fell fully
upon her, the servant-maid saw that she was
somewhat meanly dressed, and that her countenance
was none of the most pleasant to look upon. The
impression thus made upon the domestic was not
particularly favourable towards the old woman;
but the girl was artless and unsuspicious naturally,
and therefore strove to smother a feeling which she
fancied to be uncharitable towards a complete
stranger. She was therefore about to enter the
parlour to deliver the message of the visitor, when
the door of that room suddenly opened, and a beautiful
young creature, of about nineteen, made her
appearance.</p>

<p>We must pause for a for minutes to describe the
being that burst, like a seraphic vision, upon the
amazed and dazzled sight of Mrs. Mortimer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>Picture to yourself, reader, a tall, sylph-like figure
of exquisite symmetry, reminding the observer of
the Grecian models of classic female beauty,&mdash;with
the deeply-hollowed back&mdash;the swelling chest and
bosom, well matured but not voluptuously large&mdash;and
the high, swan-like neck on which the oval
head was gracefully fixed,&mdash;then fancy a countenance
of the most agreeable expression and rare
loveliness, with eyes not very large, but of the
deepest black and most melting softness, and with
brows finely arched and somewhat thickly pencilled,&mdash;a
forehead lofty and smooth, and over which
the raven hair was parted in two massive, shining
bands,&mdash;a nose with the slightest trace of the
Roman curve, and with the nostrils pink as delicate
rose-leaves,&mdash;a small mouth, the least thing
plump and pouting, and revealing teeth small, even,
and white as pearls,&mdash;and a complexion of a clear,
living white, with the carnation flush of health upon
either cheek;&mdash;picture to yourself all this assemblage
of charms, gentle reader, and you will then
have a complete idea of the enchanting creature
of nineteen, who suddenly appeared on the threshold
of the parlour-door.</p>

<p>We may, however, add, ere we resume the thread
of our narrative, that this beauteous being was attired
in a white dress, with a high corsage, and that
she wore no other ornaments than a pair of ear-rings,
and a fancy ring on one of her taper fingers.</p>

<p>Advancing towards Mrs. Mortimer, she said in a
musical voice and a kind tone, “I think I overheard
you request a few minutes’ interview with the mistress
of this house&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Such was indeed the favour I solicited,” observed
the old woman, hastily. “If my presence would
not inconvenience you for a little while,&mdash;and if
you will accept my sincere apologies for the apparent
obtrusiveness of the request, as well as for the
lateness of the hour at which it is made&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! pray do not deem it necessary to excuse a
proceeding which I am sure you will explain to my
satisfaction,” interrupted the young lady, with a
sincerity which emanated from the artlessness of a
disposition entirely unsophisticated. “Walk in,
madam,” she added, in a kind and by no means ceremonial
tone, as she conducted Mrs. Mortimer into
the parlour, the door of which the servant-maid
immediately closed behind them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer now found herself in the very
room which was fraught with so many exciting and
varied reminiscences for her. The golden lustre of
the handsome lamp which stood upon the table, was
shed upon the scene of those crushing incidents
that had suddenly made her a prisoner for a forgery
which she had committed, and her husband a
prisoner on a charge of murder of which he was
innocent!</p>

<p>The old woman sank into a chair, and gazed
around her with no affectation of emotion. The
appointments of the room were changed&mdash;materially
changed, it was true: but her eyes, nevertheless,
recognised full well&mdash;oh! full well&mdash;the very spot
where had stood the sofa on which she had awakened
to the consciousness of her desperate condition,&mdash;the
spot, too, where Torrens was standing when the
officers arrested him on suspicion of the murder of
Sir Henry Courtenay!</p>

<p>For a few minutes the old woman was powerfully
affected by the recollections thus vividly conjured
up; but, at length calling all her courage to her
aid, she regained her self-possession&mdash;and then a
rapid survey made her acquainted with the elegant
and tasteful style in which the parlour was now
fitted up. All the furniture seemed to be nearly
new. Upon the table in the middle were several
drawings, in pencil and in water-colours, lying in
an open portfolio&mdash;a box of paints and brushes&mdash;and
several prettily bound volumes of the best modern
English poets. Where a sofa had been placed in
the time when Mrs. Mortimer last knew the cottage,
a handsome upright pianoforte now stood;
and in the nearest corner was a magnificent harp.
On the cheffoniers in the window-recesses were
porcelain vases filled with flowers; and to the walls
were suspended several excellent pictures, the subjects
of which were chiefly landscapes. Everything,
in a word, denoted the chaste elegance and delicate
refinement of the taste that had presided in the
fitting up of that room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer, having recovered her self-possession,
turned towards the young lady, who had been
watching her with mingled interest and surprise.</p>

<p>“You will pardon me,” said the old woman, “if
I were for a few moments overcome by reminiscence
of an affecting nature&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Compose yourself, madam&mdash;pray, compose yourself,”
interrupted the beauteous girl, in a sweet tone
and winning manner; for not only was the most
artless amiability natural to her, but she thought
she perceived in the language of her visitor something
superior to what the condition of her apparel
and her personal appearance generally would have
otherwise led her to infer.</p>

<p>“Never can I sufficiently thank you for the urbanity&mdash;the
kindness, with which you treat me, my dear
young lady!” exclaimed the old woman. “But am
I not intruding upon your leisure&mdash;perhaps keeping
you away from some companion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! no&mdash;I am all alone here,” said the young
lady, with an ingenuous frankness that excited
a feeling of interest&mdash;almost of admiration, even
in the breast of such an one as Mrs. Mortimer.
“When I say alone,” continued the beauteous
creature, “I do not of course allude to the servants&mdash;because
they cannot be called companions,
you know; although the old housekeeper is very
kind and good-natured; and Jane&mdash;the maid who
gave you admission just now&mdash;is a sweet-tempered
girl.”</p>

<p>“And is it possible that you dwell here in complete
seclusion!” demanded the old woman, rendering
her voice as mild and her manner as conciliating
as possible.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am accustomed to this seclusion, as you
style it, madam,” exclaimed the young lady, gaily:
“for years I have lived in this manner, with my
books&mdash;my music&mdash;my drawings;&mdash;and I am very
happy,” she added, in a tone which left not a doubt
as to the sincerity of her statement. “At the same
time,” she continued, after a few moments’ pause,
and in a somewhat more serious voice, “I could
wish that my dear papa visited me a little oftener&mdash;and
that circumstances, of which I am however ignorant
did not prevent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What! does not your father live with you, my
dear young lady?” asked Mrs. Mortimer, surveying
her with the most unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p>“Alas! he does not,” replied the artless girl, her
looks and her tone now becoming suddenly mournful:
but, in the next moment, her countenance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
brightened up, and she observed, “At the same time
I am wrong to give way to sorrow in that respect,
since my dear father assures me that the reasons
are most important&mdash;most grave&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She checked herself: for it suddenly struck her
that she was bestowing her confidence upon one
who was a total stranger to her, and that such frankness
might possibly be indiscreet.</p>

<p>“And your mother, my dear lady?” said Mrs.
Mortimer, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“I never knew her,” answered the lovely creature,
in a low and almost sad tone. “But I have been all
this time wearying you with remarks and revelations
concerning myself&mdash;forgetting that I should have
first suffered you to give the promised explanation
relative to your visit. You may address me as Miss
Vernon&mdash;or Agnes Vernon, if you choose: for that
is my name. And now, tell me the object of your
call.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer gazed in astonishment upon the
charming being who was seated opposite to her.
Never had the old woman beheld so fascinating a
specimen of infantine artlessness and unsophisticated
candour. There was nothing artificial&mdash;nothing
unreal in Agnes Vernon: the innocence of
her soul&mdash;the purity of her mind&mdash;the chastity of
her thoughts, were apparent in every word she uttered
and in every feature of her bewitching face!</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;the old woman gazed long and ardently
upon the sweet countenance of that young creature,&mdash;gazed
as if in an adoration forced upon a savage
mind by the apparition of some radiant being from
a heavenly sphere!</p>

<p>“Madam, I am waiting for you to reply to me,”
said Agnes, looking down and blushing deeply,
beneath the steadfast gaze thus fixed upon her.</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons, Miss Vernon,” exclaimed
Mrs. Mortimer, recovering her self-possession. “I
was lost in thought: many&mdash;many reflections, of a
varied and conflicting nature, pressed upon my
mind,&mdash;for I must inform you that I was once the
occupant of this beautiful little house&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” ejaculated the young lady, who now
began to suspect&mdash;or, at least, thought that she had
obtained a glimpse of&mdash;the motive which had
brought her visitor thither. “You have come, then,
to cast your eyes upon a spot which is familiar to
you?”</p>

<p>“Precisely so, Miss Vernon,” said the old woman.
“And now let me announce myself to you as Mrs.
Mortimer. I am the widow of a General in the
army, and have only just returned from India.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then I can well understand, my dear
madam,” cried Agnes, firmly believing every word
that was said to her,&mdash;“I can well understand your
anxiety and longing to visit the place where you
doubtless once dwelt with the husband you have
lost.”</p>

<p>“You have read my purpose accurately, Miss,”
said the old woman, wiping her eyes as if she were
moved to tears by reminiscences of the past.</p>

<p>“But this is most singular, indeed!” suddenly
exclaimed the young lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer gazed upon her with astonishment;
for the observation that had just escaped Miss Vernon’s
lips was as extraordinary as the impulse
which had prompted it was mysterious.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the beautiful creature: “this is
indeed most singular!”</p>

<p>“Are you surprised at my boldness in thus obtruding
myself upon your presence?” asked Mrs.
Mortimer, fixing her eyes in a searching manner
upon the charming countenance of the young lady:
“or do you doubt the existence of the sentiment
which brought me hither?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no&mdash;no, madam!” exclaimed Agnes, in a
tone of the deepest sincerity, while her features suddenly
betrayed the grief which she experienced
at being suspected of what she would have regarded
as a cruel scepticism. “I am sure you could have
no other motive for coming hither than the one you
alleged: but I said it was singular&mdash;because, another
person&mdash;a few days ago&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Mrs. Mortimer, a sudden idea
striking her: in a word, she already felt confident
that her visit would not prove abortive, and that
she had acted with sagacity in seeking the first
trace of Torrens at the very house which he had
inhabited years ago.</p>

<p>“You now appear to be surprised in your turn,”
observed Agnes, struck by the ejaculation which
had burst from the old woman’s lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear young lady,” said Mrs. Mortimer; “I
was indeed surprised&mdash;inasmuch as I gathered from
your words that another person, actuated by the
same sentiment as that which brought me to this
spot&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And do you know <em>that other person</em>, then?” inquired
Agnes.</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I have now to ascertain,”
answered the old woman. “The moment I understood
the sense of your observation respecting the
visit of another individual to the cottage, I began
to wonder whether it were any friend of my earlier
years&mdash;perhaps even a relative&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He was an old man, with grey hair and a care-worn
countenance,” said Agnes, perceiving that
Mrs. Mortimer paused and seemed to be deeply affected;
“and he told me that he also had once
dwelt in this house. He sate down in this very
parlour, and appeared to be overcome with grief
for a long time. I offered to leave the room, that
he might be alone with his mournful reflections:
but he conjured me to stay. And then he informed
me that he had known griefs so profound&mdash;vicissitudes
so terrible&mdash;privations so great, that they
had almost driven him mad; and, when I proposed
in as delicate a manner as possible to afford him
such relief as my means would permit, he assured
me that he was poor no longer, and that he had gold
at his command. Then, in another moment, he exclaimed,
with an emphasis which almost frightened
me&mdash;‘<em>But, oh! that I were indeed the penniless, half-starving
wretch I was some days ago!</em>’”</p>

<p>“Ah! he said <em>that</em>&mdash;did he?” muttered the old
woman to herself. “Remorse has already overtaken
him&mdash;and he will the more easily yield to my
menaces and become my victim!”</p>

<p>“I did not catch your observation, madam,” said
Agnes.</p>

<p>“I was only musing, my dear child,” hastily responded
Mrs. Mortimer, “upon the misfortunes of
this strange world of ours. Doubtless some dreadful
affliction had touched the brain of that poor old
man of whom you have been speaking.”</p>

<p>“Such was indeed my fear,” exclaimed Agnes;
“and, much as I pitied him, I confess that I was
greatly relieved when he took his departure.”</p>

<p>“Was his visit a long one, my dear young lady?”
asked Mrs. Mortimer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>“He remained here for upwards of an hour,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“And was it in the evening that he called?” inquired
the old woman.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;between eight and nine o’clock; and he
rose from his seat as the time-piece struck ten,”
responded Agnes. “I know not precisely wherefore&mdash;but
it is nevertheless true that his presence
began to alarm me, although I had done him no injury,
and indeed had never in my life seen him before.
But there was such a wild expression in his
eyes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! doubtless the poor old man was overcome
by many painful recollections,” said Mrs. Mortimer.
“I suppose he did not mention his name to you,
Miss Vernon?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;and I did not like to ask him,” was the
frank and ingenuous reply. “His mind was evidently
much unsettled,&mdash;for it alternated between
a profound grief and a restless excitement&mdash;so that
while he was here, I was at one moment moved to
sympathise with him, and at another forced to regard
him with vague apprehension. When he spoke
of the fact that he himself had once been the occupant
of this dwelling, he glanced hastily around the
parlour, and murmured three or four times in a
tone scarcely audible, ‘<em>This is the very room&mdash;the
very room!</em>’ I could not divine what he meant, and
of course dared not ask him,” added Agnes, with
that charming ingenuousness of manner which denoted
the pure child of nature, untainted by
the artificial formalities of a vitiated state of society.</p>

<p>“How long have you resided here, Miss?” inquired
the old woman, after a brief pause, during
which she reflected on all that the beauteous girl
had just told her,&mdash;at the same time chuckling
inwardly at the certainty of having ascertained two
grand facts: namely, that Torrens was possessed of
plenty of gold, and that he was in London.</p>

<p>“I have lived in this pretty house for nearly
three years, madam,” answered Agnes. “Before that
period I&mdash;&mdash;But now,” she added, checking herself,
“I am again troubling you with my own affairs,
whereas you have sufficient upon your mind to
engross all your attention. Oh! yes&mdash;you must
have,” exclaimed the artless girl,&mdash;“having only
just returned to England after so long an absence
in India! But you did not tell me whether you
recognised in the old gentleman of whom I have
been speaking, any relative or friend&mdash;any person,
in fine, in whom you are interested.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear young lady,” responded Mrs.
Mortimer; “methinks that he cannot be altogether
unknown to me;&mdash;and yet, my thoughts are so bewildered
at this moment&mdash;the reminiscences which
have been awakened in my mind by this visit to a
spot where I myself once dwelt, and where I have
passed so many happy hours with my dear deceased
husband, General Mortimer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! do not weep, madam&mdash;compose yourself,
I beseech you!” exclaimed Agnes, whose unsuspicious
soul was touched by the grief which her artful
visitor simulated so aptly.</p>

<p>“Dear young lady,” murmured Mrs. Mortimer,
pressing Miss Vernon’s hand to her lips, “you will
perhaps allow me to visit you again?”</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly,” was the reply, given with cheerful
and unaffected cordiality. “You are the widow
of an officer of high rank&mdash;and therefore I cannot
be doing wrong by receiving you at my house. At
the same time,” added Agnes, after a moment’s reflection,
“I do not imagine that my father&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the young lady’s remark was cut short in
the middle by a loud knocking at the front-door.
Mrs. Mortimer started up, as she felt that she was
an intruder, and that her business there was of an
equivocal character not likely to stand the test of
any inquiry that might be put by a person less
artless and unsophisticated than Miss Vernon
herself: but that young lady, having a pure conscience,
and not dreaming that she had even acted
with imprudence in permitting a stranger to foist
herself upon her, said in a cheerful manner, “Oh!
it is my father’s knock&mdash;I know it well! You
need not be uneasy.”</p>

<p>At this moment the parlour-door opened, and the
pretty maid-servant appeared on the threshold to
usher in a gentleman of whose personal appearance
we must give a brief description.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLIX">CHAPTER CLIX.<br />

<span class="medium">MRS. MORTIMER’S ADVENTURES CONTINUED.</span></h2>

<p>The individual alluded to was a man of middle
height, of rather spare form, and slightly bowed&mdash;so
that although his years in reality had scarcely
numbered sixty, a casual beholder might have pronounced
him to be above seventy. A closer observation
would, however, have dispelled this first impression;
for his features were handsome and well-preserved,
his teeth remarkably fine, and his hands
entirely free from those wrinkles which usually appear
upon the fingers of persons in the winter of
their existence. His hair was of that iron grey
which showed that it still retained a faint shade of
its former blackness; and baldness had not even
begun to rob him of any part of that natural covering.
He wore no whiskers; and his countenance
was smooth, but pale. In a word, his frame still
preserved much of its pristine vigour; though its
spareness and the slightly curved back were calculated,
as above mentioned, to impress a casual
observer with the idea that the individual whom we
are describing was older than in reality he was.</p>

<p>We have said that his features were handsome;
and we should now state that their general expression
was pleasing, conciliating, and agreeable.
Amiability of disposition, generosity of heart, and
an acquaintance with affliction, were easily read
upon that calm, pensive countenance; but, commingled
therewith, was an air of serene dignity
which bespoke a consciousness of some kind of superiority&mdash;whether
of rank, wealth, or intellect, could
not, however, be immediately decided by the observer.
At all events, the person whom we have now introduced
to our readers was not one to be passed by
with indifference, nor confounded with the ordinary
mass of mankind. We must, however, explain that
he was rather characterised by a distinguished air
of good breeding and consummate politeness than
by aristocratic hauteur; at the same time there was
so much dignity and loftiness about him as to debar
even the most obtrusive and unceremonious from
taking advantage of that blandness of disposition
which was expressed by the countenance. We have
only to add that he was dressed with taste, if not
elegance; and the reader has before him as perfect
a picture as we can draw of the personal appearance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of the individual who now entered the parlour
of the cottage.</p>

<p>The moment he had crossed the threshold of the
room, Agnes sprang towards him, saying, “My
dearest father, I am delighted to see you! But let
me hope that nothing unpleasant has caused this
late visit.”</p>

<p>And, as she spoke, she embraced with almost infantine
tenderness the parent who affectionately
returned her caresses.</p>

<p>“Nothing unpleasant, my dear child,” was the
reply; and then the young maiden’s father cast an
enquiring glance towards Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“This lady,” said Agnes, “is the widow of a
General who recently died in India; and, having
herself occupied the cottage many years ago, she
felt anxious, on her return to England, to visit the
place which had so many pleasing and some melancholy
associations for her.”</p>

<p>“The lady is most welcome,” observed the gentleman;
“and her name&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Mortimer,” added Agnes: then, with
ingenuous affability, she said, turning to the old
woman, “Madam, permit me to introduce my
beloved father, Mr. Vernon.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Vernon bowed coldly, and even eyed the
visitor suspiciously, as he observed, “I was not
aware that any General-officer bearing the name of
Mortimer had recently died in India.”</p>

<p>“My deceased husband,” said the old woman, with
admirable presence of mind, “was not in the English
service. He was in that of the Honourable
East India Company.”</p>

<p>“I was not aware,” repeated Mr. Vernon, still in
the same chilling tone, “that there were General-officers
in the service of the East India Company.
Madam,” he continued, now fixing his gaze sternly
upon her, “wherefore have you come hither?&mdash;on
what pretence have you intruded yourself upon the
sacred privacy of my daughter?”</p>

<p>“The motive was the one which Miss Vernon has
explained to you, sir,” replied Mrs. Mortimer, whose
self-possession had been for a few moments considerably
disturbed by the confident manner in
which the young lady’s father had exposed her
second falsehood.</p>

<p>“Then, if that motive were really the true one,
madam,” he said, his sternness again changing to
freezing politeness, “your object is probably gained
by this time; and, as it is now ten o’clock, you will
perhaps have the kindness to leave me with my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Oh! assuredly, sir,” exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer,
glad of an opportunity to escape from the house;
and Mr. Vernon, with constrained courtesy, hastened
to open the door to afford her egress.</p>

<p>The old woman breathed more freely when she
was once more outside the walls of the cottage;
for the sudden advent of the young maiden’s father
had not a little embarrassed, even if it had not
altogether discomfited her.</p>

<p>But no sooner was she in the open air, when she
began to ask herself a thousand questions as she
retraced her way up the lane.</p>

<p>What meant the mystery which evidently hung
around the present occupant of the cottage?&mdash;wherefore
did that charming creature dwell there
alone?&mdash;why was her father only a visitor, instead
of being a resident at his daughter’s abode?&mdash;and
for what aim, or through what motive, was so fair
a flower buried in such seclusion?</p>

<p>That Agnes was indeed the pure, innocent, artless
creature which she appeared to be, the old
crone was sure. Too well acquainted with the
world was Mrs. Mortimer not to perceive that the
ingenuous <em>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</em> of the young girl was real and
natural, and not artificial and assumed. For an
instant the impure imagination of the wretch had
suggested that Miss Vernon might only be the pensioned
mistress of some wealthy individual; but in
another moment that hypothesis was altogether
discarded. No: Agnes was not tainted with even
the slightest&mdash;faintest shade of immorality: her
mind was innocence itself&mdash;and her chastity as
unblemished as the driven snow. Even the old
woman, whose life had been so tremendously dissolute,
was compelled to embrace this conviction;
but the very experience which she herself had
gained in the sphere of licentiousness, dissimulation,
and guile, helped Mrs. Mortimer to arrive at
that unquestionable conclusion.</p>

<p>Who and what, then, was Agnes Vernon;&mdash;who
and what was her father?</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer was a person having an eye to her
own individual advantage in every circumstance
which, coming under her cognisance, seemed to present
a chance of affording scope for her selfish, interested,
sinister interference. Wherever a mystery
appeared, there she beheld an opportunity for her
officious meddling: this officious meddling led to
the discovery of secrets and to the eliciting of revelations:&mdash;and
the information thus gleaned became
a sort of marketable commodity with Mrs. Mortimer.
In a word, she would seek to gain the confidence
of those who had matters of importance to
communicate, so that she might subsequently render
herself so useful as to deserve payment, or at all
events acquire the position of one who could exact
a good price for her secresy respecting the things
so imprudently entrusted to her.</p>

<p>Calculations in accordance with this disposition
on her part, and having reference to the cottage
which she had just left, were passing in her mind
as she sped along the lane,&mdash;when, midway in that
narrow thoroughfare, she was overtaken by some
one who had hurried after her, but whose footsteps
she had not heard, in the pre-occupation of her
thoughts, until they were close behind her.</p>

<p>She stepped&mdash;turned round&mdash;and beheld, by the
bright starlight, a tall young gentleman, apparently
handsome so far as she could distinguish his features,
and dressed in an elegant style.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my good woman,” said he, “for addressing
you; but observing that you came from the
cottage yonder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;I did,” interrupted Mrs. Mortimer,
who, in her eagerness to learn the motive of the
young gentleman’s accosting her, gave him encouragement
to proceed.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said he, speaking with an equal impatience,&mdash;“tell
me&mdash;do you know the beautiful
creature who dwells in that seclusion? But of
course you must know her&mdash;you have been there&mdash;perhaps
in her company&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have only just left her presence,” observed
Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“And you are well acquainted with her, then?”
cried the young gentleman, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Perfectly well,” was the answer. “But wherefore
these questions?”</p>

<p>“Oh! if I could trust you!” ejaculated the stranger,
in a tone that alike proffered and invited confidence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>

<p>“You can&mdash;you may,” said the old woman, impressively.</p>

<p>“If I were assured of that, I would reward you
well,” was his next remark.</p>

<p>“How can I prove that I am trustworthy?” demanded
Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“By telling me all you know concerning the
beauteous creature who resides in that strange
seclusion,” responded the young gentleman.</p>

<p>“Then you yourself know nothing of her or of
her affairs?” said the old woman, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing&mdash;save and except
that she is the most lovely being that mortal eyes
ever beheld!”</p>

<p>“You are not even aware that she has resided
there for these three years past?” observed Mrs.
Mortimer, assuming a mysterious tone as if about
to become more communicative.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;that fact I have learnt,” replied the young
gentleman; “and also that her name is Agnes
Vernon. I have moreover ascertained that an
elderly gentleman visits her occasionally;&mdash;and I
have sometimes harboured the worst fears&mdash;&mdash;But,
no&mdash;no,” he exclaimed, suddenly interrupting himself
and speaking in an impassioned tone: “such
suspicions are no doubt foully injurious to that
charming creature! I have contemplated her,
myself being unseen, for hours together when she
has been walking in her garden,&mdash;and purity, innocence,
artlessness are written upon her spotless
brow&mdash;traced in every lineament of her bewitching
countenance. Oh! If I could only obtain the
assurance that the old man who thus visits her
were a relation&mdash;a guardian&mdash;or a valued friend,&mdash;that
he is nothing more to her than&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I can relieve you of this suspense, sir,” said
Mrs. Mortimer, “and thereby give you a proof of
my readiness to assist you. The elderly gentleman
whom you have seen visiting at that cottage, and
who indeed is there at this moment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I saw him enter,” exclaimed the
young man, impatiently. “But who is he?”</p>

<p>“Her father!” answered Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Her father!” repeated the stranger. “Oh! that
is scarcely probable! You are deceiving me:&mdash;you
are pretending to give me explanations relative to
mysteries which are likewise enigmas to you,&mdash;or
you are purposely deluding me! Her father!&mdash;impossible!
What&mdash;would a parent leave his
daughter&mdash;and that daughter so transcendently
lovely&mdash;to dwell in such utter seclusion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Such is indeed the case, sir,” interrupted Mrs.
Mortimer; “and I have little cause to thank you
for thus boldly and even insolently accusing me of
wilfully deceiving you.”</p>

<p>And, as she thus spoke, the old woman moved
rapidly away, well knowing that the young gentleman
would not part with her in this manner.</p>

<p>“Stop one minute&mdash;stay&mdash;I beseech you&mdash;and
pardon me!” he exclaimed, hastening after her. “I
was wrong to address you in such a style: I insulted
you grossly&mdash;and I crave your forgiveness. But I
was bewildered with the intelligence you gave me:
mingled joy and surprise deprived me, as it were,
of my reason. I imagined the information to be too
welcome and too extraordinary to be true!”</p>

<p>“And yet you ere now sought to persuade yourself
that Agnes Vernon was chaste and pure, though
you were then ignorant of the connexion subsisting
between herself and the elderly gentleman who
visits her&mdash;a connexion which, previously to the
explanation I have given you, must at least have
appeared suspicious, and calculated to raise the
most serious misgivings in your breast.”</p>

<p>“I admit that my conduct is most inconsistent,”
exclaimed the young gentleman, in answer to these
reproachful words: “but I love Agnes Vernon&mdash;I
adore her&mdash;I worship the very ground upon which
she treads&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you have never yet spoken to her?” asked
the old woman.</p>

<p>“I have never dared to intrude myself so far upon
her notice,” was the reply: “and yet she has seen
me frequently in the neighbourhood&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But she never gave you the least encouragement,
sir,” interrupted Mrs. Mortimer, as if making
an assertion, instead of throwing out a remark for
the sake of gleaning information.</p>

<p>“Never&mdash;never!” exclaimed the young man; “and
therefore did I think so well of her character, in
spite of the suspicious circumstances attending her
seclusion.”</p>

<p>“You have, then, the vanity to suppose that if
the beautiful Agnes could have smiled upon any
man, you were destined to be that happy one;”&mdash;and,
as Mrs. Mortimer made this remark, her voice
assumed a somewhat caustic tone.</p>

<p>“Oh! you have misunderstood my words,” cried
the stranger. “I intended to have you infer that
I had never seen any thing in the demeanour and
deportment of Agnes Vernon save what is becoming
to a young lady of good birth, genteel breeding, and
taintless soul. At the same time,” he added, proudly,
“I flatter myself that there is nothing particularly
disagreeable in my personal appearance, as there is
assuredly everything favourable in my social position.
But of <em>this</em> Agnes is ignorant; and I am desirous to
obtain an interview with her&mdash;or to write to her in
a respectful manner&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what has hitherto prevented you from doing
either?” asked Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“I have already told you that I dared not accost
her. Often and often have I longed to burst through
the green hedge which has concealed me from her
view, and throw myself at her feet: but an invisible
hand has restrained me&mdash;and I have experienced a
species of awe for which I could not account, and
which has made me feel as if I were in the vicinity
of a goddess. Then, as to writing to her,” continued
the impassioned young man, “I was once
bold enough to commit a few words to paper&mdash;and
I endeavoured to persuade the young servant-girl
to give the note to her mistress.”</p>

<p>“And she treated you with contempt,” said Mrs.
Mortimer, anticipating the fate of the <em>billet</em> from
the fact that Jane, the pretty domestic, had so indignantly
rejected her own proffer of five shillings.</p>

<p>“You have guessed rightly&mdash;and now I am more
than ever convinced that you are well acquainted
with the honest, upright, disinterested character of
the dwellers in that cottage,” said the young gentleman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer remained silent for a few minutes.
She was absorbed in thought. Should she enter
into this new affair which seemed almost to force
itself upon her? or had she not enough already
upon her hands? She had promised to rejoin her
daughter Laura by a particular day in Paris; and
there was not much time to lose. Nevertheless,
she had a good week, or even more, at her disposal&mdash;providing
that she was speedily successful in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
tracing out Torrens; and, all things duly considered,
she fancied that she might as well undertake a
business which promised remuneration, and which
would probably place her in a condition to learn
secrets and dive into mysteries, a knowledge of
which might prove serviceable in the hands of such
an intriguing, mercenary disposition as her own.
Moreover, the larger were her own special resources,
the greater was her independence in respect
to her rebellious daughter; and therefore,
after a short interval passed in deep reflection, she
said, “Sir, I am both ready and able to serve you.
But my time is precious now, and will be so for a
short time to come. Five days hence I will attend
to any appointment that you may name.”</p>

<div id="i_209" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_209.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I will give you my card,” said the young gentleman:
“and I shall expect you to call upon me
in the evening of the fifth day from this date.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” ejaculated the old woman, as she received
the card. “My name is Mortimer; and,
although you do not address me as becomes my
position, I can assure you that I am a lady by birth,
education, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was about to say “conduct;” but the young
gentleman, interrupted her timeously enough,
though unwittingly on his part, to prevent her giving
utterance to the atrocious lie;&mdash;for he observed,
as he thrust his purse into her hand, “Pardon me,
madam, if I have not behaved courteously towards
you: but I presume that your circumstances are
not as flourishing as they ought to be, and gold is
no object to me. Five days hence we meet: till
then, farewell.”</p>

<p>And, without waiting for any reply, he hurried
away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer followed along the lane not
with any purpose of watching him, but simply
because her own route lay in the same direction.
The echoes of his retreating steps, however, soon
died in the distance; and the old woman sped along
until she reached that public-house where, as the
reader may remember, Tom Rain and Clarence
Villiers met on the night of the elopement nearly
twenty years before.</p>

<p>Approaching the window, whence a bright glare
streamed forth, Mrs. Mortimer examined the card
that had been placed in her hands, and, to her astonishment,
found that the hero of her most recent
adventure was Lord William Trevelyan, and that
his residence was in Park Square. She knew enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
of the English peerage to be well aware that the
nobleman whom chance had thus thrown in her
way was the second son of the Marquis of Curzon,
a peer of immense wealth, and who permitted his
three male children&mdash;all fine young men&mdash;to enjoy
each a separate establishment for himself, for
which purpose he allowed them handsome incomes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer was therefore well pleased at the
encounter which she had that evening made; and
in more ways than one was she rejoiced at having
visited the cottage in the neighbourhood of Streatham,&mdash;especially
as the purse which Lord William had
given her contained thirty guineas.</p>

<p>An omnibus passing at this moment, the old woman
entered the vehicle, and alighted in the Borough.
She was speeding homeward&mdash;that is to
say, to the coffee-house where she had fixed her
temporary abode&mdash;when, as she was threading a narrow
street that offered her a short cut to the place
of destination, she was suddenly struck by the certainty
that a man who was walking slowly in advance,
and whom she had nearly overtaken, was
neither more nor less than the object of her
search!</p>

<p>For, as he had turned to cast a rapid, stealthy
glance around, the light of a lamp had beamed
fully upon his countenance;&mdash;and that countenance,
altered though it were, was too well known
to the old woman not to be immediately recognised.</p>

<p>Yes: there indeed was Torrens,&mdash;there&mdash;in her
power&mdash;within a few paces of her;&mdash;and thus had
accident once more materially served his malignant,
evil-intentioned pursuer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer was so excited by this sudden discovery,
that she was compelled to pause for a moment
and lean against a wall for support. But,
almost immediately afterwards recovering her energy
and presence of mind, she hastened on, and came
near enough up with Torrens to behold him enter a
house of mean and miserable appearance.</p>

<p>“Now you are in my power!” muttered the old
woman to herself, but in reality apostrophising the
individual who was still her husband: and, without
another moment’s hesitation, she knocked at the
door of the dwelling.</p>

<p>Some minutes elapsed before it was opened; and
at length a dirty, slipshod drab of a girl made her
appearance.</p>

<p>“I wish to speak to the man who has just entered
here,” said Mrs. Mortimer, unceremoniously pushing
her way into the narrow, dark, and unpleasantly
smelling passage.</p>

<p>“Oh! you means old Mr. Smith what lives down
stairs, I des say,” observed the girl.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it,” returned Mrs. Mortimer,
officiously closing the street-door. “Come, my
dear, show me the way&mdash;and I will give you sixpence
for yourself.”</p>

<p>This promise acted like magic upon the girl, who
forthwith fetched a lighted candle from a room
opening from the passage, and conducted the old
woman to a precipitate flight of steps, down which
she pointed, saying, “There&mdash;right at the bottom:
the door faces you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer placed the promised gratuity in
her hand, and the girl held the candle high up to
light her as she descended.</p>

<p>“That will do, my dear,” said the old woman
when she had reached the last step of the dangerous
flight; and the girl disappeared, leaving the place
in utter darkness.</p>

<p>Before the candle had been thus removed, however,
Mrs. Mortimer had hastily reconnoitred the
locality; and, applying her hand to a latch, she
opened a door, and in another moment found herself
in the presence of her husband!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLX">CHAPTER CLX.<br />

<span class="medium">THE HUSBAND AND WIFE.</span></h2>

<p>The place where the husband and wife met thus,
after a separation of upwards of nineteen years, was
what the poor term “a kitchen,” but which rather
merited the designation of “a cellar.” The roof
was low and arched&mdash;the rough brick-work of the
walls, once smeared with white-wash, was now
dingy all over&mdash;and in the day-time a gleam of light
was admitted by means of a miserably small window
protected and also darkened by a grating set in
the foot-way of the street. The den contained a
fire-place, where the inmate might cook his victuals
if he were able to bear the intolerable heat of a fire
in the midst of summer; and at the extremity facing
the window was a small bed. A table, two chairs, a
few articles of crockery, and a washing-stand, completed
the appointments of this wretched place,
which was dimly lighted by a solitary candle.</p>

<p>The reader is already aware that Torrens was
much altered in personal appearance: nevertheless,
his wife had recognised him in the street without
any difficulty. But it was not precisely the same
on his part: had <em>he</em> met <em>her</em> in an accidental manner,
he would not have known her, so remarkable was
the change that had taken place in her. Yet he
did know her now&mdash;for he had seen her in the little
parlour at Percival’s house; and the moment she
stood before him on the threshold of his present
hiding-place, a cry of horror and alarm escaped his
lips.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer closed the door, and, taking a
chair, motioned her husband likewise to be seated&mdash;a
kind of command which he mechanically obeyed;
for something told him that he was in the power of
the woman whom he hated and abhorred.</p>

<p>“We meet after a long, long separation,” she said,
in a low tone, which left him still in utter doubt as
to whether the object of her visit was peace or
war.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” he observed, nervously: “but wherefore
should we meet at all?”</p>

<p>“Not to exchange caresses and endearing words&mdash;not
to unite our fortunes or our misfortunes, as
husband and wife,” responded the old woman. “Of
<em>that</em> you may be well assured!”</p>

<p>“Then, again I ask&mdash;wherefore should we meet?”
demanded Torrens.</p>

<p>“Because this interview suits my purposes,” returned
Mrs. Mortimer, with a malignant grin; “and
I may as well commence by assuring you that you
are completely in my power.”</p>

<p>“In your power!” repeated the old man, casting
a ghastly look of mingled apprehension and appeal
on her who thus proclaimed her authority, and who
seemed resolved to exercise it.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;in my power,” she exclaimed, in an impressive
manner. “Do you know that I was arrested
on suspicion of being the murderess, or at
all events concerned in the murder&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>“Murder! oh&mdash;my God!” moaned Torrens, clasping
his hands together in convulsive anguish, as
he glared wildly around.</p>

<p>“Do not affect ignorance of the fact,” said Mrs.
Mortimer: “because you are doubtless well aware
that I <em>was</em> arrested for <em>your</em> crime.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no: you cannot prove that I did it&mdash;you
can prove nothing!” cried Torrens, with a species
of hysterical violence.</p>

<p>“I can prove that <em>you</em> were the murderer of Percival,”
responded the old woman, fixing her eyes
sternly upon her husband.</p>

<p>“Liar&mdash;wretch&mdash;I defy you!” exclaimed Torrens,
his energy suddenly reviving as he saw the absolute
necessity of meeting with boldness a charge which
he felt convinced his wife could <em>not</em> prove against
him: for how could she possibly entertain anything
more serious than a bare suspicion?</p>

<p>“Harsh words and abuse will not intimidate me,”
said she, in a quiet voice; “and all these variations
in your manner&mdash;nervousness at one moment, terror
the next, and then excitement&mdash;only tend to confirm
me in my ideas. Listen, old man&mdash;and see
whether I have just ground for those ideas, and
whether you could explain away my tale, if told to
the nearest police-magistrate.”</p>

<p>Torrens groaned audibly, and fell back in his
chair&mdash;but not insensible&mdash;only in the exhaustion of
his physical and the prostration of his moral energies;
and his eyes glared in consternation on the
countenance of the accusing fiend whose very presence
would have been intolerable, even if he had
committed no crime for her to be able to accuse
him of.</p>

<p>“Listen, I say,” resumed the implacable old
woman. “You were at Percival’s house a few
moments before myself and daughter called upon
him. You seemed to be very miserable&mdash;so miserable
that you wished to obtain assistance from him.
These were the very words he used to me; and he
observed likewise that he never <em>gave</em>&mdash;consequently
you extorted nothing from him. But you watched
through the window-shutters, from the outside,
the interview which took place between him
and myself and daughter: you beheld the gold and
the notes displayed upon the table; and when the
old miser was once more alone, you entered the
house&mdash;and&mdash;and you murdered him with a bludgeon!”</p>

<p>Torrens started convulsively, and endeavoured to
give utterance to an ejaculation of denial; but his
tongue clave to the roof of his mouth, and his throat
was as parched as if he had been swallowing ashes.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you murdered him,” repeated Mrs. Mortimer,
apparently dwelling with fiendish delight upon
the horrible accusation: “you beat the wretched
man to death&mdash;your blows were dealt with a cruel,
a merciless effect. Then you plundered the iron
safe&mdash;you took all the treasure contained in the
tin-case&mdash;gold and bank-notes to the amount of
several thousands of pounds!”</p>

<p>“It is not true&mdash;it is not true!” said Torrens,
partially recovering the power of speech.</p>

<p>“But it <em>is</em> true&mdash;all true&mdash;precisely as I now
repeat the details,” cried Mrs. Mortimer, emphatically.</p>

<p>“You are mad to think me the possessor of such
a treasure, when you find me in this miserable
place, with thread-bare garments, and surrounded
by every proof of a poverty amounting almost to
utter destitution,” said Torrens, his courage to
meet the charge somewhat reviving as he flattered
himself that the argument just used was decisive
and unanswerable.</p>

<p>“Do you imagine me to be so thoroughly ignorant
of the world as to become your dupe on such easy
terms?” demanded the old woman, in a tone of
withering scorn. “Look at all I have passed
through, and then ask yourself whether it be possible
to deceive and mislead me! No, no&mdash;I understand
it all. You believe that suspicion will never
fall upon the wretched inmate of such a wretched
place,” she continued, glancing slowly around the
cellar&mdash;“and your calculation is a correct one.
Here might you have concealed yourself&mdash;here
might you have passed some weeks in apparent poverty,
until the storm should have blown over. But
it was destined that <em>one</em> person should obtain a clue
to your guilt and a trace to your lurking-hole&mdash;and
that person is myself! Nay, to convince you how
well all your late proceedings are known to me, I
have only to mention the fact that a few days ago
you visited the cottage which once bore your
name&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Torrens, startled by this new
proof of how well-informed his hated wife in reality
was concerning his movements.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and to the fair inmate of that dwelling,”
she added, with a look full of malignant meaning,
“you admitted that you were poor no longer, but
that you wished you indeed were the penniless and
half-starving wretch you had so recently been!
Thus the very outpourings of your remorse, old
man, have furnished me with arguments&mdash;damning
arguments&mdash;against you, and confirmed all my previous
suspicions, if such confirmation were for an
instant needed.”</p>

<p>“Why do you now come to me?” asked Torrens,
in a faint and faltering tone, while his entire frame
trembled nervously, and his countenance became so
ghastly, that it was absolutely hideous to behold.</p>

<p>“My purpose is stern and immoveable,” replied
the old woman.</p>

<p>“And that purpose&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;” faltered Torrens,
trembling like an aspen.</p>

<p>“The surrender of every shilling&mdash;yes, every shilling&mdash;of
the treasure which you plundered from the
murdered Percival,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Malediction!” ejaculated the wretched man,
starting wildly from his seat as if he had received a
sudden wound: then, sinking back again through
sheer exhaustion, he pressed his hand to his throbbing
brows, murmuring and lamenting in broken
sentences such as these:&mdash;“My gold&mdash;my notes&mdash;the
treasure I lost my soul to gain&mdash;the riches I had
hoped to enjoy&mdash;the wealth to acquire which I imbrued
my hands in blood&mdash;the blood of a fellow-creature&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;you
shall not have my treasure.”</p>

<p>And he started up, flinging his arms wildly about
him, while his eyes rolled horribly in their sockets,
as if he were attacked by delirium.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer sate calm and motionless, resolved
to allow the paroxysm to pass ere she reiterated her
stern demand. She knew&mdash;she saw that he was in
her power,&mdash;now more so than ever, since he had
admitted the dread crime by his unguarded exclamations.</p>

<p>“Woman, you will drive me mad!” suddenly cried
her husband, falling back again into his seat, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
looking at her with a hyena-like rage expressed
upon his countenance.</p>

<p>“I do not seek such a catastrophe,” she observed,
coolly.</p>

<p>“But you an urging me to it,” he replied, with
savage fierceness. “No&mdash;no&mdash;I will not surrender
my gold: you cannot compel me!”</p>

<p>“It is for you to decide whether you will adopt
that alternative, or pass hence in a few minutes to
the nearest station-house,” responded Mrs. Mortimer,
her voice being still characterised by a calmness
and deliberation indicative of the most implacable
sternness of purpose.</p>

<p>“The station-house!” moaned Torrens, with a
cold shudder: then, again becoming dreadfully
excited, he exclaimed, “I will die first&mdash;and you
shall perish also! Yes&mdash;I will murder you, and
afterwards&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This is child’s play!” said Mrs. Mortimer,
laughing at the threat, as she took up a knife which
lay upon the table. “Advance towards me another
pace&mdash;and I will plunge this sharp blade into your
heart. The treasure, which is no doubt concealed
somewhere in the room, will then fall into my hands
all the same.”</p>

<p>“You are determined to rifle me of all I possess&mdash;to
plunder me&mdash;to make me penniless!” cried
Torrens, falling back in his seat, and giving way
to his despair. “Can nothing move you? But,
listen&mdash;listen: I will give you half&mdash;yes&mdash;one-half
of the whole amount&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I came not to receive terms, but to dictate them,”
interrupted Mrs. Mortimer. “And now reflect
well upon your position, old man;&mdash;and remember
also that your wild ravings may draw listeners to
the door, and your guilt will be no longer a secret
existing between you and me. Then, naught&mdash;naught
can save your neck from the halter!”</p>

<p>“My God! she speaks truly,” murmured Torrens,
bewildered by the dreadful thoughts that
rushed to his brain as the woman spoke so calmly
and deliberately of the ignominious death which
might overtake him: “yes&mdash;she speaks truly!”
he repeated; “and yet, if I give up all&mdash;surrender
everything&mdash;on what am I to live? how am I to
sustain my miserable existence?”</p>

<p>“You had no kind thought&mdash;no compassion for
me, when you had friends to help you, and I was
banished across the wide ocean,” said Mrs. Mortimer:
“you cared not what became of me at that
time, Torrens&mdash;and I have now no pity, no sympathy
for you! I am aware that you loathe and
detest me;&mdash;but your aversion surpasses not that
which I entertain for you. There we are well
matched: it is however in our relative positions that
I have gained the ascendancy and can wield the
authority of a despot. My crime is of old date, and
has been expiated by many long, long years of horrible
exile and servitude in a penal colony: your
crime is new&mdash;the blood is scarcely dry upon your
hands&mdash;your victim is scarcely cold in his grave&mdash;and
your guilt can only be expiated on the scaffold.”</p>

<p>“Spare me&mdash;spare me,” groaned the wretched
man, clasping his hands together in an anguish
which, assassin as he was, would have moved any
other than the soul-hardened, implacable Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Spare you, indeed!” she repeated, in a contemptuous
tone: “in what way can I spare you? If you ask
me not to betray you into the hands of the officers of
justice, I at once reassure you on that head&mdash;but with
the one condition that you surrender up to me, and
without further parley, every sixpence of the amount
you have secreted somewhere in this place. I do
not seek your life: I wish you to live, that you may
be miserable&mdash;that you may know what starvation
is&mdash;that you may wander the streets, houseless and
penniless&mdash;dependent upon eleemosynary charity&mdash;begging
your bread&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven! it is a fiend who is addressing
these frightful words to me now!” ejaculated Torrens,
surveying his wife with horror and astonishment.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it is a woman,&mdash;a woman whom you deserted
in her bitter trouble, and who now wreaks
her vengeance upon you,” said Mrs. Mortimer.
“Carry back your reminiscences some nineteen years
or upwards, and contrast our positions then. You
found friends and relations to console you while
still in gaol, and to assist you after your release.
But did you come near me? did you even send a
word or a line to sympathise or to proffer aid!
Miserable wretch that you are, I could wish that
you were ten thousand times more miserable still!”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is impossible&mdash;impossible!” exclaimed
Torrens, his cadaverous countenance denoting, by
its hideous, painful workings, the sincerity&mdash;the
profound sincerity that prompted the averment he
had just made. “Were you to search the earth
over, you could not find a being more miserable
than I! And now&mdash;and now,” he continued, in a
faltering tone, while tears trickled down his furrowed
cheeks,&mdash;“now, will you have compassion
upon me?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;ten thousand times <em>no</em>!” ejaculated Mrs.
Mortimer. “And I warn you to hasten and surrender
your wealth&mdash;or I shall lose all power of
restraining my impatience.”</p>

<p>Torrens rose from his seat, cast one look of
malignant&mdash;diabolical hate upon the merciless
woman, dashed the traces of grief away from his
cheeks, and then turned towards the bed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer followed him with her eyes&mdash;those
eyes now so greedy, suspicions, and anxious lest by
any possibility her prey should escape her!</p>

<p>The wretched old man, whose heart experienced
all the pains of hell, slowly and with trembling
hands raised the miserable mattresses; and from
beneath he drew forth a small parcel, wrapped in
brown paper and tied with a thick string. This
he handed to Mrs. Mortimer, who, heedless of the
terrible glance which accompanied it, hastened to
open the packet and examine its contents.</p>

<p>And now her triumph was complete;&mdash;for the
parcel enclosed gold and notes to an amount which
she proceeded in a leisurely manner to compute.</p>

<p>“Five thousand four hundred pounds,” she said
aloud, casting a malignant look upon Torrens, who
had resumed his seat and appeared to be the victim
of a despair that must terminate in the total wreck
of his reason. “And here,” she continued, now
musing to herself rather than speaking for his behoof,&mdash;“here
is a document that may prove of some
importance to me,&mdash;the promissory note of the
young man who called himself <em>Viscount Marston</em>.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she carefully packed up the parcel
once more, and secured it about her person.</p>

<p>“And you will not leave me a guinea&mdash;a single
guinea?” asked Torrent, in a low, hollow voice&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
entire aspect indicating that he was almost stupified
by the merciless cupidity of his wife.</p>

<p>“Not a single guinea,” she replied. “The only
consolation I can afford you is the assurance that
your secret is safe with me. If you are ever sent
to the scaffold&mdash;it will not be through my instrumentality.”</p>

<p>With these words, she retreated towards the door,
walking backwards, so as to keep her eyes fixed
upon Torrens the whole time, and thus be prepared
for a sudden attack should he meditate mischief,
or, in an ungovernable paroxysm of rage and despair,
attempt it.</p>

<p>But the old man moved not from his seat, although
he appeared to reel and sway unsteadily
backward and forward in his chair; and at the
moment when Mrs. Mortimer placed her hand on
the latch, he fell heavily upon the floor.</p>

<p>She was about to depart when it struck her that,
if he were dead, unpleasant suspicions might attach
themselves to her, should she hurry away without
raising any alarm; and she accordingly hastened
towards him. He was senseless&mdash;but the spark of
life was not extinct; and now through fear did the
woman perform those duties to which she never
could have been otherwise urged in respect to him.
She raised him in her arms&mdash;she placed him on the
bed&mdash;removed his neckcloth&mdash;and sprinkled water
upon his face. In a few minutes he began to revive,
and his eyes opened slowly.</p>

<p>“Where am I?&mdash;is it a dream?” he murmured in
a faint tone: then, as his recollection returned
with speed and vividness, and he knew the countenance
that was bending over him, and remembered
why the woman herself was there, he exclaimed,
“Fiend! give me back my gold!”</p>

<p>“Never!” was the emphatic word that fell upon
his ear in reply&mdash;and in another moment he was
alone.</p>

<p>No&mdash;not alone: for Despair was now his companion.</p>

<p>And Despair is an appalling guest:&mdash;for, murderer
as the man was, he had some kind of worldly consolation
left in his treasure until the implacable
woman wrested it from him. But now that only
solace was gone&mdash;and he was left to the horror of
his thoughts, and to the ghost of his victim. Beggary
was before him&mdash;beggary, with all its hideous
train of evils, and those evils rendered the more terrible
because beyond loomed the black and ominous
gibbet!</p>

<p>Oh! how was it that madness did not seize upon
the old man’s brain, and rob him of the power of
making these agonizing reflections?</p>

<p>Was it that his punishment was to begin upon
earth? If so, assuredly the retribution was appalling,
even on this side of the tomb;&mdash;and he had
not even left to him the consolation that the gold for
which he had bartered his soul was still in his possession&mdash;still
at his command, and available for
his use!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXI">CHAPTER CLXI.<br />

<span class="medium">AGNES VERNON AND HER FATHER.</span></h2>

<p>We must now return to the cottage near Streatham,
were we left the beautiful and artless Agnes
Vernon with her father.</p>

<p>The moment the old woman had quitted the
house, Mr. Vernon turned towards his daughter,
and, taking her hand, said, “My dearest child, how
came you to admit a complete stranger into your
presence in so unguarded a manner?”</p>

<p>“As I had never seen her in my life before, dear
father,” replied the charming girl, “I could not for
an instant suppose that she had any evil intention
in visiting the cottage; because, having done her no
harm&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, my beloved Agnes,” interrupted her parent
kindly, as he made her sit down near him as he also
took a chair, “I have often told you that the world
contains many wicked people, who frequently harbour
the basest and most infamous designs towards
young women who are pretty and unsuspecting as
you; and this Mrs. Mortimer, as she calls herself,
may be one of the class I have alluded to.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry indeed that I should have acted in a
way to cause you any displeasure, my dearest father,”
said Agnes, her eyes filling with tears; “but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You do not understand me, my sweet child,”
again interrupted Mr. Vernon, passing his hand
affectionately over her glossy hair, and pure, polished
brow; “I am not angry with you&mdash;indeed, it would
be impossible to experience any irritation with such
an amiable, excellent girl as you are. But I am
alarmed lest evil-disposed persons should seek to do
you an injury&mdash;and therefore I recommend caution
and prudence on your part.”</p>

<p>“I cannot comprehend how the old lady who was
here just now could possibly seek to harm me,”
said the amiable Agnes, “since I have never harmed
her, and, on the contrary, treated her with the respect
due to her years and her afflictions.”</p>

<p>“What did she tell you, my love?” inquired
Mr. Vernon.</p>

<p>Agnes forthwith related, in her own natural,
simple, yet agreeable manner, the entire conversation
which had passed between herself and Mrs.
Mortimer.</p>

<p>Her father listened with earnest attention; and
for some minutes after she had ceased speaking, he
remained absorbed in deep thought.</p>

<p>“You are not pleased with the incident of this
evening,” said Agnes, at length, and speaking in a
timid voice, as she gazed with anxious fondness on
her parent’s pensive countenance.</p>

<p>“Once more I assure you, my well-beloved child,”
he responded, “that I am not angry with you. But
you will, perhaps, be somewhat surprised to hear
me declare that I do not believe one syllable of all
the old woman told you. In the great world, Agnes,
there is no such thing as that sentimentalism and
sympathy which she professed to be the motives
that led her to visit the cottage ere now. I detected
her in two falsehoods&mdash;and I have every reason to
suspect all the rest.”</p>

<p>“But was it not natural, dear papa, for her to be
desirous to behold once more the scene where she
had passed many happy days with her deceased
husband?” inquired Agnes. “Oh! I can well understand
such a feeling&mdash;and I therefore honoured
and respected her for entertaining it.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;there are a few generous hearts that would
experience such sentiments,” observed Mr. Vernon;
“for perhaps I was too hasty ere now in the sweeping
condemnation which I levelled at what I termed
the great world. At the same time, Agnes, you
must not judge the world by your own pure and
unsophisticated soul. And would to God that experience
might never be destined to teach you other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
lessons than those which seclusion and good training
have already inculcated: would to God that you
might never be compelled to look upon the dark
side of human affairs!”</p>

<p>“Have I other lessons to learn&mdash;other teachings
to undergo&mdash;other experience to acquire, beyond
what I already know?” asked the ingenuous and
candid Agnes.</p>

<p>“Alas! yes&mdash;and in a variety of ways,” responded
her father, with a sigh. “You have as yet seen only
one phase of the world&mdash;that of tranquillity, serene
happiness, and peace. You have not even heard
the storms of that world in the distance. Hitherto
your life has been passed under the most genial influences;
and you know nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing,
of what may be termed <em>life</em>. Again I say,
therefore, how deeply&mdash;how earnestly it is to be
wished that your mind may never become acquainted
with the bitter teachings of vicissitude or
misfortune.”</p>

<p>“I am already well aware, my dear father, from
my historical studies and from the perusal of the
books which you have selected for me, that mankind
pursues many and varied conflicting interests,
and that <em>gain</em> is the chief object thus sought after,
But I am still at a loss,” continued the beautiful
Agnes, “to understand how people can be wicked
enough to injure others who have never injured
them, and when the infliction of such injury can
confer no benefit upon the individual who is guilty
of such flagrant wrong. Suppose, for instance,
that this Mrs. Mortimer who was here just now,
should in reality entertain some evil design towards
me, how could she possibly acquire any personal
advantage from the pursuit of such conduct?”</p>

<p>“You are as yet too innocent&mdash;oh! far too innocent,
if not too young, to understand these matters,”
said Mr. Vernon, gazing with all a father’s
affection upon his beauteous and artless child.
“Neither is it for me to remove the film from your
eyes in this respect.”</p>

<p>“And yet, dear papa,” she observed, with the
most endearing, amiable <em>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</em>, “if no one will
point out the shoals, rocks, and quicksands to me,
how can I possibly avoid them? You see that just
now I erred by receiving that person too frankly&mdash;too
cordially&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And the old man who called the other evening,
too,” said her father, with a smile. “Now, do you
not perceive, my dear child, that there is something
suspicious in these two visits, which indeed appear
to have some degree of relationship to each other,
and perhaps had the same instigation. I cannot
conceive that accident should send two persons
hither, separately and at a short interval, on the
same pretence, unless they were acting in collusion.
That such an accidental coincidence might happen,
I admit; but prudence&mdash;worldly prudence, my
love, makes us look suspiciously upon such events;
and I confess that this is the light in which I view
the present occurrences. The woman represented
herself as the widow of a General who had lately
died in India: now I happen to be so well-informed
on these matters as to be enabled to state most
emphatically that no General-officer of that name
has existed for many years past. Finding herself
at fault in respect to her first assertion, your
visitor endeavoured to make good her tale by means
of a second; but the falsehood was equally palpable
in this latter case. Now, therefore, my dearest
Agnes, you comprehend that there are good
and just grounds for suspecting the motive which
led her hither.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that persons can be so wicked?”
exclaimed the young maiden.</p>

<p>“It is, alas! too true,” replied her father; “and
therefore you cannot be too much upon your guard
in respect to strangers. I wonder that Mrs. Gifford
did not represent to you the impropriety of allowing
the old man to force his way into your presence
a few days ago&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Both Mrs. Gifford and Jane spoke to me on the
subject after he was gone,” said Agnes, desirous to
rescue her two servants from blame: “but I fancied
their timidity had made them conjure up visions of
thieves and housebreakers, and I only laughed while
they remonstrated.”</p>

<p>“Then you now perceive, dear Agnes, that they
were right in the observations which they undertook
to address to you,” said Mr. Vernon.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and I am sorry that I did not listen with
more attention,” answered the amiable girl. “In
future, my dear father, I will allow no one to enter
the house unless he or she be the bearer of a letter
from you.”</p>

<p>“This is precisely what I could desire, Agnes,”
exclaimed Mr. Vernon; “and you will afford me
unfeigned pleasure if you adhere to this resolution.”</p>

<p>“You know that I will do all you enjoin&mdash;even
without questioning your motives,” observed Agnes.
“Command&mdash;and I obey.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, the word ‘<em>command</em>’ exists not
in the vocabulary that I have to use when conveying
my wishes to you. So dutiful&mdash;so good&mdash;so
willing are you, Agnes, that I have never had occasion
to speak with imperiousness or harshness to
you. You do not even question me concerning
those matters which might naturally awaken your
curiosity and your interest.”</p>

<p>“It is sufficient for me to know that you desire
me to dwell in this seclusion,” said Agnes; “and
as you have exerted yourself, my dearest father, to
surround me with every comfort&mdash;every element of
happiness, I should be indeed ungrateful and unjust
were I to seek prematurely those explanations
which you have promised to give me when the proper
time shall arrive.”</p>

<p>“And that time is not so very far distant, Agnes,”
said Mr. Vernon. “Two years more&mdash;and I
shall no longer have any secrets from you. But
while we are thus conversing, I forget that it is
waxing late and that I have not even as yet begun
to account for the sudden and unexpected visit
which circumstances have compelled me to pay you
this evening.”</p>

<p>Agnes now regarded her parent with some degree
of suspense; for his remark had brought back to
her memory the circumstance that he had never
called at so late an hour before, and, moreover,
that this was the third time he had visited her
within the week&mdash;an occurrence at variance with
his ordinary habit.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said Mr. Vernon, speaking in
the kindest tone possible, “I am compelled to leave
England on urgent business to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Leave England!” repeated Agnes, tears starting
into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, my beloved&mdash;and I regret to add that my
absence may be of some weeks’ duration. Paris is
the place whither this sudden and unexpected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
business calls me; and though I shall be away from
you, yet will you ever be present in my thoughts,
and I shall write to you frequently.”</p>

<p>“But how many weeks shall you be absent, my
dear father?” asked Agnes, the pearly drops now
chasing each other adown her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Eight or ten, my child,” responded Mr. Vernon:
“but at the expiration of that period you will be
certain to see me again. Remember, Agnes, that
far longer intervals than this have occurred during
which we have been completely separated&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear father&mdash;when I was staying in the
country with my governess, who is now no more,”
interrupted Agnes, unable to stifle her sobs: “but
ever since her death I have seen you frequently&mdash;far
more frequently.”</p>

<p>“Because I removed you to this cottage which I
purchased for you, and which is so much nearer to
London than was Mrs. Clement’s abode at St.
Alban’s. However, my sweet Agnes&mdash;compose
yourself&mdash;cheer up&mdash;and wipe away those tears.
I cannot bear to see you weep,” he added, his own
voice growing tremulous. “Two months or two
months and a half will soon glide away; and I shall
bring you a number of presents from Paris.”</p>

<p>“You spoil me with your kindness, my dear father,”
exclaimed the beautiful girl, throwing her
arms about his neck, and embracing him tenderly.
“I am afraid that I must cost you a great deal of
money&mdash;for you are always buying me something
new. But then, you are very rich&mdash;are you not,
dear papa!”</p>

<p>“Thank God, I am&mdash;and for your sake!” cried
Mr. Vernon, returning her fond caresses. “The time
will come, Agnes, when you will learn how powerful
a talisman, in respect to happiness, is money.
Some of the books which I have selected for you
inculcate maxims against avarice, covetousness, and
selfishness: while others even go further, and endeavour
to prove that a moderate competency is
more compatible with true happiness than an immense
fortune can possibly be. But I much question
whether the authors of those works would not have
leapt at the chance of giving the truth of their
assertions a fair trial through the medium of experience
in respect to the possession of riches. Such
books, however, do good; they infuse salutary
thoughts into the mind&mdash;although the influence
thereof must inevitably become subdued, if not
altogether destroyed, in proportion as the individual
advances in worldly knowledge, and finds worldly
interests crowding upon him. Riches, my dearest
Agnes, may become a blessing or a curse according
to the manner in which the possessor uses them;
and by this observation I believe that I shall have
opened a new field for the exercise of your reflections
and good sense.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you have indeed, my kind father!” exclaimed
Agnes. “But&mdash;to return to the object of
your visit this evening&mdash;may I express a hope that
the business which calls you to Paris is of no unpleasant
nature?”</p>

<p>“By no means, my love,” answered Mr. Vernon,
smiling affectionately upon his amiable daughter.
“And now I must take my departure&mdash;for it is
eleven o’clock. You will remark, dear Agnes, the
advice I gave you relative to the visits of strangers;
for I should be unhappy indeed, if I thought that
your artless, unsuspecting character were likely to
be the very cause of exposing you to peril.”</p>

<p>“You may depend upon my prudence in future,
dear father,” said Agnes; “and I am rejoiced that
you have given me such timely warning. Oh! who
could have thought that the old man who seemed
so deeply affected, and the woman who spoke so
tenderly of her deceased husband, could have harboured
any sinister design? It is really enough to
render one suspicious of everything and everybody
in future.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear child&mdash;you must not fall into the
opposite extreme,” cried Mr. Vernon, hastily. “Because,
for instance, a mendicant to whom you give
alms should turn out to be an imposter, do not
argue therefrom that all destitute persons are
rogues. I do not wish distrust and suspicion to take
the place of your generous frankness and amiable
candour; but I am desirous that, while preserving
the artlessness and ingenuousness of your disposition,
you should at the same time adopt those precautions
which common prudence suggests. And
now, my sweet Agnes, embrace me and then retire
to your own chamber&mdash;for, ere I depart, I have a
few instructions to give to Mrs. Gifford, whom you
will please to send hither to me.”</p>

<p>The beauteous maiden once more threw her
arms round her father’s neck and covered his face
with her kisses and her tears: then, having received
his blessing&mdash;a blessing which he gave from the
very bottom of his heart&mdash;she reluctantly tore herself
away from his arms, and quitted the room.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mrs. Gifford, the housekeeper,
made her appearance. She was a woman of about
fifty-six years of age&mdash;stout, respectable-looking,
and with a countenance in which honesty and
good-temper were alike read as plainly as the words
in a book.</p>

<p>On entering the parlour, she closed the door
carefully behind her; and then her demeanour
suddenly became profoundly reverential as she
advanced towards the father of her young mistress.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gifford,” said he, in a tone of friendly
confidence, “I am about to visit Paris, and therefore
thought it necessary to see you for a few
moments, previous to my departure. Not that I
need recommend my beloved child to your care&mdash;for
I am well assured that you watch over her
safety and her happiness as zealously as if she were
your own daughter.”</p>

<p>“Your lordship&mdash;” began the housekeeper, in a
tone of the deepest respect.</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed he whom we must still call
Mr. Vernon, in spite of the aristocratic title by which
Mrs. Gifford had addressed him: “remember
that walls have ears, my good friend! I was about
to observe to you that Agnes, through the amiable
confidence and ingenuousness which are natural to
her, has allowed two strangers,&mdash;one a few evenings
ago&mdash;the other this very night,&mdash;to intrude
themselves upon her; and I tremble lest their
motive be a bad one. The gardener and his assistant
invariably sleep in the out-house, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my&mdash;I mean, sir,” answered Mrs. Gifford;
“and they are resolute, determined men, who would
not permit plunderers to enter these premises with
impunity.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Mr. Vernon. “Did you
yourself see the old man who called here the other
night?”</p>

<p>“I did not, sir,” replied Mrs. Gifford. “But
Jane assured me his appearance was that of a man
worn down with old age, wretchedness, and poverty,
rather than of an evil-intentioned person. Shall I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
tell your lord&mdash;shall I tell you, sir,” said the good
woman, hastily correcting herself, “what is my
impression relative to that old man? Why, sir,”
she continued, perceiving that Mr. Vernon nodded
approvingly, “it struck me that it might be that
Mr. Torrens, who used to live here many, many
years ago, and of whom we heard such dreadful
tales shortly after your lord&mdash;I mean, shortly after
you bought the cottage.”</p>

<p>“But those tales&mdash;has Agnes learnt them?&mdash;have
they reached her ears?” demanded Mr. Vernon,
hastily: “because they might terrify and alarm
her.”</p>

<p>“No, sir&mdash;she is entirely ignorant of all the
legends attached to this house,” was the reply;
“and it is not by any means likely that they can
reach her ears. Jane is a discreet, good girl, and
would not allude to them for worlds.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” ejaculated Mr. Vernon; “for
were Agnes to learn what we ourselves only heard
after the entire purchase was concluded and you
were located here,&mdash;were she to learn, I say, that a
horrible murder had been committed in this house,
I would at once procure her another dwelling. But
you were speaking ere now about the very Torrens
who was so unjustly accused of that foul
crime.”</p>

<p>“I was observing, sir, that I fancied the old man
who called here the other night might be he; for
as Miss afterwards told me, he spoke of having
lived here many years ago, and of the terrible misfortunes
he had endured; and then he glanced round
the parlour repeatedly, observing in an audible
though anguished tone, ‘<em>This is the very room&mdash;this
is the very room!</em>’ And <em>this</em> is the room,” continued
Mrs. Gifford, “where the baronet was murdered;
and therefore I conclude that the old man was none
other than the wretched Torrens.”</p>

<p>“Your surmises are most natural,” said Mr. Vernon,
after a few moments’ reflection. “But who,
then, was the old woman that came just now? And
yet,” he proceeded, “though I spoke of her lightly
and irreverently as <em>an old woman</em>, I am bound to
admit that there was really a something about her
which gave me the idea of one who had seen better
days. Her language was especially lady-like and
correct. She said she had lived here many years
ago&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And yet,” interrupted Mrs. Gifford, “the cottage
was shut up for nearly eight years after the
murder; and then the landlord into whose hands
it had fallen, and who was a widower, came and
resided here himself, as no one would take it. He
occupied it until his death; and then your lord&mdash;and
then, I mean, you purchased it, sir, together
with the garden and orchard attached to it.”</p>

<p>“And what would you infer from all these circumstances?”
inquired Mr. Vernon.</p>

<p>“That if the old woman really did live here many
years ago, it must have been during Torrens’ time,”
explained the housekeeper; “because he built the
cottage, and resided in it until the murder; after
which, as I just now said, it was shut up for a
lengthened period. Now, strange though it may
seem, an idea has likewise struck me relative to the
old woman&mdash;or old lady&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what is your idea!” asked Mr. Vernon.</p>

<p>“That she is that Mrs. Slingsby&mdash;or Mrs. Torrens,
who got into trouble at the same time as the
husband she had just married. If my conjectures are
correct, sir, I do not think that you have any cause
for apprehension in the two visits which have been
paid to the cottage.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you upon the shrewdness which
you have displayed in dealing with the subject,”
said Mr. Vernon, smiling; “and I am inclined to
adopt the views which your sagacity suggests.
Perhaps, then, there is really nothing to fear: but,
of course, Mrs. Gifford, you will exercise the utmost
prudence and the most unwearying vigilance in regard
to my darling child. You know how dear she is
to me&mdash;you are also acquainted with the unhappy
circumstances which force me to condemn her to
this seclusion until she shall have attained her
twenty-first year&mdash;unless,” he added, in a more
measured tone, “death shall in the meantime snatch
away that woman whom I cannot call my&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My lord! my lord!” exclaimed the housekeeper,
in an imploring voice; “give not way to recollections
which always excite you so painfully! With
me your charming Agnes is safe&mdash;and you are well
aware that I love her as much as if she were my own
child! Besides, the deep&mdash;the many debts of gratitude
which I owe to your lordship&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush!” interrupted Mr. Vernon; “for
again I tell you that the very walls have ears&mdash;and
I would not that my rank should be even suspected&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me&mdash;I forgot your oft-repeated injunctions
on that head,” said Mrs. Gifford. “But you
must not suppose that because I am thus sometimes
oblivious in your presence, I ever allow a single
word to slip from my tongue that may create a suspicion
in the mind of Miss Agnes or Jane.”</p>

<p>“And now, Mrs. Gifford,” observed Mr. Vernon,
“I have one more question to ask you:&mdash;has that
young gentleman who once dared to ask Jane to deliver
a note to my daughter&mdash;has he ventured into
this neighbourhood since?”</p>

<p>“I must confess, sir,” was the answer, “that I
have seen him loitering about the cottage on one or
two occasions: but as he never seeks to obtrude
himself upon the notice of Miss Agnes, I have not
thought it worth while, nor even prudent, to suggest
to the dear young lady what course she ought
to pursue in case he should address her. Besides,
he appears to be a gentleman in every sense of the
word; and I do not apprehend any rudeness on his
part towards your daughter. Indeed, he appeared
much humiliated and very penitent when Jane so
resolutely refused to become the bearer of his missive
or to receive his bribe.”</p>

<p>“You have acted with prudence: it would be unwise
to make any observation to Agnes relative to
this stranger, under present circumstances,” said
Mr. Vernon. “Were you to speak to her on the
subject, you must necessarily explain the nature
of that sentiment which has attracted the young
gentleman to this neighbourhood&mdash;and to talk to
her relative to the passion of love, were to destroy
some portion of that artless innocence&mdash;that infantine
purity of soul, which characterises her. In a
word, I trust my dear child to your care and discretion,
Mrs. Gifford;&mdash;and I shall expect that you
will write to me at least once a week during my
absence.”</p>

<p>Mr. Vernon then wrote upon a slip of paper the
address where letters would reach him in Paris;
and, having next placed a roll of bank notes in Mrs.
Gifford’s hands for the expenses of the little establishment
until his return, he took his departure.

<span class="medium">LAURA IN PARIS.</span></h2>

<p>We must now return for a short time to the
beautiful, but licentious and profligate Laura, whom
we left in Paris.</p>

<p>Although she reckoned materially upon her
mother’s aid in respect to her new designs, she
nevertheless resolved to enjoy herself during the
old woman’s absence; and the thought even struck
her that it was possible&mdash;though not very probable&mdash;for
her to form some brilliant connexion without
the assistance of her parent. At all events, she
reasoned that there was no harm in making the
trial; and therefore, the moment Mrs. Mortimer
had taken her departure for England, Laura commenced
her preparations for pleasure, and perhaps
for intrigue.</p>

<p>She hired a private box at each of the principal
theatres, and purchased a handsome carriage and a
pair of beautiful horses; and then she engaged a
celebrated artist to paint her portrait, well knowing
that his <em>studio</em> was frequented by men of rank
and fortune, and calculating that a view of the
splendid countenance on the canvass would inspire
the liveliest curiosity to behold the living original.
She likewise secured the services of an eminent
musician to give her lessons in the divine art; and
this gentleman, believing her to be highly respectable,
introduced her to his wife, and invited her to
a musical soir&eacute;e, where her beauty and the report
which had been spread to the effect that she was an
heiress who had just succeeded to her property,
rendered her the centre of attraction.</p>

<p>By the means just enumerated, Laura gained one
grand object&mdash;an entrance into respectable society;
and this difficult point was accomplished in less
than four days after her mother’s departure from
Paris.</p>

<p>She soon began to be talked about&mdash;but not
with suspicion. No&mdash;it was her transcendent beauty
that became the theme of discourse; and the admiration
with which she had inspired both the
French and English gentlemen at the soir&eacute;e, rendered
them so enthusiastic in her praise, that they
unconsciously suffered themselves to be hurried into
assertions guaranteeing her respectability and virtue,
as well as expatiating on her charms.</p>

<p>Thus was it, for instance, that one of her French
admirers would speak:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<p>“Never in my life did I behold so beauteous a
creature as Miss Laura Mortimer, an English lady
whom I met at the soir&eacute;e last evening. What a
pity it is that she cannot talk French: how sweet
would our language sound when wafted by such a
melodious voice! It is, however, fortunate that I
myself understand the English tongue, or I should
have been debarred the pleasure of exchanging a
syllable with that houri. Houri! Mahommed never
dreamt of such a glorious creature! Her hair is of
the richest brown that I ever saw&mdash;glossy, luxuriant,
and shining: her forehead is of a height and
width deserving to sustain a queenly diadem; and
her eyes, large and brilliant, are of a dark grey when
looked into attentively, but seem to be of a deeper
hue to the casual observer. Then her teeth&mdash;never
were beheld such pearls! But her form&mdash;her figure&mdash;oh,
it were impossible to find words to describe
the charms of that magnificent shape! A critic,
having the ancient models of classic female beauty
in his mind, would perhaps pronounce her bust to
be in proportions too voluptuous: but let him contemplate
that graceful slope of the shoulders&mdash;the
arching of the swan-like neck&mdash;the fine expansion of
the chest&mdash;the perfect roundness of the bosom&mdash;the
just symmetry of the waist&mdash;and the dazzling whiteness
of the charms revealed by the low corsage of
the evening toilette,&mdash;let the admirer of ancient
models behold all this, and he will soon confess that
he would have nothing changed in the contours of
Laura Mortimer’s figure. Oh! she was indeed heavenly
in her elegant, but tasteful attire; and the
lustre of her eyes outvied the brilliancy of her diamonds.
But, in addition to her faultless beauty
there is about her an air of virgin freshness that
indicates a mind pure and untainted; though, at the
same time, it is easy to perceive that Laura Mortimer
is no inexperienced girl. She is, on the contrary,
a young woman of fine intellect, proud soul,
and independent spirit,&mdash;energetic, without being
masculine,&mdash;firm, yet endowed with all the natural
softness of her sex. That her passions are strong
and her disposition even sensual, you may read in
her eyes and in the lineaments of her aquiline
countenance;&mdash;but that an honest pride enables her
to put a curb upon her ardent imagination, is
equally certain. Happy will be the man who shall
win so inestimable a prize!”</p>

<p>“I understand,” another enthusiastic admirer
would observe, “that she is possessed of a fine property.
Her deceased father, I am told, was a wealthy
nabob; and she expects her mother shortly to join
her in Paris. The old lady has gone to England to
make certain transfers from the British to the
French funds, in behalf of her daughter. Miss Mortimer
is decidedly the most charming creature that
ever burst thus suddenly upon the dazzled sight of
the fashionable world in Paris. Oh! how I envy
the professor of music who gives her lessons, and
the artist who is painting her portrait! Never could
I grow weary of contemplating that splendid countenance,
or of listening to that voice so full of
melody!”</p>

<p>In a word, within a very few days from the time
when she took the handsome suite of apartments
in the Rue Monthabor, Laura became the topic of
conversation amongst all the nobles and gentlemen,
French or foreign, in the fashionable quarters
of Paris; and those who heard the praises so lavishly
bestowed upon her by the envied few that had already
formed her acquaintance, longed to be presented
to this goddess of beauty!</p>

<p>One danger she incurred&mdash;and of this she was
sensible: it consisted in the fact that the persons
belonging to the hotel where she and Charles Hatfield
had at first put up, and likewise the British
chaplain and his clerk, were aware that she was
married! But she calculated that the chances of
detection or exposure at their hands were very insignificant
and scarcely worth a thought: for even
though any of the parties alluded to should meet
and recognise her, they would believe themselves to
be mistaken in respect to the identity of Laura
Mortimer with Perdita Hatfield. Besides, Paris was
a very large city; and months might elapse before
such a meeting or recognition took place; and in
the meantime she hoped to have so successfully
conducted her intrigues as to be able to return to
England in complete independence of her convention
with Mr. Hatfield.</p>

<p>It was on the sixth morning after Laura had
taken up her abode in the Rue Monthabor that she
saw a paragraph in <cite>Galignani’s Messenger</cite>, the English
journal published in Paris, announcing that
His Sovereign Highness the Grand Duke of Castelcicala,
who had just succeeded to that lofty rank
in consequence of his father-in-law’s demise, had
arrived on the preceding evening in the French
capital, on his way to Italy. The article, in the
usual fulsome manner, stated that his Sovereign
Highness intended to remain one day in Paris, in
order to have a private interview with the King of
the French; and the journalist proceeded to give a
list of the noblemen and gentlemen composing the
suite of the Grand Duke. In that category there
was one English name;&mdash;and that name was
<span class="smcap">Charles Hatfield</span>!</p>

<p>“Charles Hatfield!” exclaimed Laura, in astonishment,
and scarcely able to believe the evidence of
her own eyes; but a second reference to the paragraph
assured her that she had indeed made no
mistake. “Ah! I comprehend,” she murmured to
herself, as she laid the paper upon the breakfast
table, at which she was seated; “this is the course
that his stern father has adopted in order to throw
him amidst new scenes, and remove him afar from
the meridian of London as well as from that of
Paris! He is to be sent into a species of ostracism
in Italy, until he shall have been weaned from the
lingering affection he entertains for <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>Thus reasoning within herself, Laura rose from
the sofa whereon she had been reclining, and approached
a mirror, on whose bright and polished
surface she beheld the glorious reflection of her
countenance,&mdash;that countenance which was now
radiant with the triumph that filled her soul.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured to herself, as she still
continued to survey her image in the glass,&mdash;“his
father is afraid that he will yet fly back to my arms&mdash;afraid
that the magic of my beauty may once more
draw him within the sphere of its influence!”</p>

<p>As these thoughts passed through her brain, her
soul was filled with an ineffable exultation;&mdash;for she
marked the flashing of her fine eyes, and the dazzling
brilliancy of the teeth that appeared like pearls
set between two rubies,&mdash;marked also the glow of
rich carnation on her cheeks, in such striking contrast
to the alabaster shoulders and swelling bosom
whiter than Parian marble, and which, according to
a habit produced by the natural voluptuousness of
her temperament, were purposely left more than
half exposed even when she was alone,&mdash;all those
beauties&mdash;her own transcendent beauties&mdash;she beheld
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
reflected in the faithful mirror; and never was
woman more profoundly conscious of the sovereign
power which perfect loveliness exercises over the
heart of man, than was Laura Mortimer on this
occasion.</p>

<p>The reader has already seen enough of this young
woman to be well aware that she was a most extraordinary
character; and, though her conduct would
in another often warrant the belief that she was
made up of <em>contradictions</em>, yet with her those very
deeds or thoughts that might seem to deserve such
a name, were in reality in perfect keeping with a
disposition to the reading of whose depths and intricacies
the key of no ordinary experience of the
female heart would serve.</p>

<p>Thus was it that a wild&mdash;a strange&mdash;and a daring
scheme rose up in her mind, as, surveying her peerless
charms in the polished mirror, she repeated to
herself, “Charles Hatfield is in Paris! He will be
in the capital for twenty-four hours; and in twenty-four
hours so much may be done! May I not take
the first step in my meditated vengeance&mdash;a small
step, it is true,&mdash;and yet a commencement! Yes&mdash;at
the same time I may prove the irresistible power
of my beauty, and wring his recreant heart with a
jealousy&mdash;a jealousy so keen, so acute, so galling
that he shall writhe in agony of spirit, and yet dare
not utter a word! All this I can do, and still not
violate my compact with his father. For how run
the conditions? <em>Never to molest the young man in
any way&mdash;never to return to England, but to fix my
abode in some continental State&mdash;and never to reveal
the fact of our marriage!</em> Not one of those conditions
shall I break by the plan which now engages
my attention. For if we happen to meet in the
same room, or at the same public resort, it cannot
be said that I molest him. No:&mdash;and now for the
execution of my project&mdash;a project that, in its carrying
out, will excite in his breast the tortures of
hell!”</p>

<p>And the beauteous mouth was wreathed into a
smile of malignant&mdash;almost fiend-like triumph, as
those last words came hissing between her pearly
teeth&mdash;not borne upon a voice melodious as a silver
bell, but in a tone so changed for a few moments,
that had she spoken in the dark, with her own mother
or Charles Hatfield present, but able only to <em>hear</em>
and not to <em>see</em>, that voice would not have been recognised
by them!</p>

<p>Rosalie, the adept and intriguing lady’s-maid,
was now summoned to hold a conference with her
mistress.</p>

<p>“It is my intention to appear in the Champs
Elys&eacute;es this afternoon, attired in the most becoming
manner,” said Laura. “The day is gloriously fine,
and the carriage will be open. I wish you to exercise
all your judgment and your best taste in the
superintendence of my toilette. Let me have no
gaudy colours&mdash;nothing savouring of splendour.
Chaste elegance must characterise my costume: in
a word, Rosalie, let my beauty be enhanced by my
apparel, without appearing to be in any way indebted
to artificial means.”</p>

<p>“I understand you, <em>mademoiselle</em>,” said Rosalie;
“and you may depend upon me.”</p>

<p>“But now I wish to appeal to your ingenuity, my
dear girl,” proceeded Laura,&mdash;“having thus recommended
myself to your good taste. Listen attentively!
The Grand Duke of Castelcicala is in
Paris; and his stay is limited to a few hours.
Charles Hatfield,” she continued, sinking her voice
almost to a whisper, as if the very walls had ears,
“is in his suite; and I am desirous that <em>he</em>&mdash;Charles
Hatfield&mdash;accompanied by three or four other gentlemen
in the Duke’s service, should be allured by
some means to the Champs Elys&eacute;es this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“You wish that Mr. Charles and his companions
may appear, either on foot or horseback, in the
fashionable lounge at the time when you yourself
will be there?” said Rosalie, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“You have expressed my desire with accuracy,”
observed Laura. “Does your imagination suggest
any plan by which this aim can be accomplished?”</p>

<p>Rosalie reflected profoundly for upwards of a
minute: then, suddenly turning towards her mistress,
she said, “Can you tell me the names of any
of the nobles or gentlemen in the Duke’s suite, besides
Mr. Charles Hatfield?”</p>

<p>Laura immediately directed Rosalie’s attention to
the paragraph in the <em>Messenger</em>; and the cunning
lady’s-maid, having perused it, exclaimed, “Will
you leave this matter entirely in my hands, <em>mademoiselle</em>?”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered Laura. “But, whatever be
your plan, remember that you must not compromise
me. All I demand or require is that
Charles Hatfield, accompanied by three or four of
his comrades in the Duke’s service, shall visit the
Champs Elys&eacute;es this afternoon. The rest concerns
me.”</p>

<p>“I understand you, <em>mademoiselle</em>,” said Rosalie:
“you may trust entirely to my discretion, without
entertaining the least dread of being in any way
compromised.”</p>

<p>The abigail then retired, and Laura was left alone
to meditate upon the scheme she had thus set on
foot.</p>

<p>How her dependant proposed to act, in order to
accomplish that part of the design which had been
entrusted to her, Laura could not conceive: nor
indeed did she give herself much trouble to conjecture.
She placed full reliance upon the tact, discretion,
and ability of Rosalie; and regarded success
as certain.</p>

<p>In order to while away the time, she turned to her
writing-table, and examined a packet which her
music-master had left with her on the previous
evening. The enclosure consisted of English
translations of several of the most popular French
songs and national airs; and Laura set herself deliberately
to the study of these pieces, well aware
that an acquaintance with their tendency and spirit
would prove of advantage to her in conversation.</p>

<p>The first manuscript to which she thus earnestly
addressed herself, was a free version of that soul-stirring
hymn, <em>La Marseillaise</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p>By the time Laura had completed the perusal of
these poems, Rosalie reappeared: and the arch smile
which the pretty lady’s-maid wore, seemed to indicate
that success had crowned the task that had
been entrusted to her.</p>

<p>“What tidings have you for me?” asked Laura.</p>

<p>“I think, <em>mademoiselle</em>, that you may safely reckon
upon beholding Mr. Charles Hatfield, together with
two or three of his comrades in the Grand Duke’s
suite, in the Champs Elys&eacute;es between four and five
o’clock. But do not wait to ask me my reasons for
giving you this assurance,” added Rosalie, hastily:
“it is nearly three o’clock, <em>mademoiselle</em>&mdash;and you
must think of your toilette.”</p>

<p>“Excellent Rosalie!” ejaculated Laura: “how
deeply I am indebted to you for your proceedings in
my behalf!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she repaired to her bed-chamber,
whither the French abigail followed; and then the
toilette commenced.</p>

<p>At about a quarter to four o’clock, Laura emerged
from her private apartment, and descended to her
carriage which was waiting for her. The equipage
then moved rapidly away towards the Champs
Elys&eacute;es.</p>

<p>Glorious was the afternoon&mdash;and queen-like in
her beauty was Laura Mortimer!</p>

<p>Contrary to her usual custom, she had her hair
dressed in ringlets, which in a luxuriant shower
framed her splendid countenance. There was a
flush of health, heightened by her own heart’s emotions,
on either cheek: but, by the admirable control
which she was enabled to exercise over her
features, her countenance was serene, and her eyes
shone not with a lustre unmellowed by feminine
softness. She reclined back in her carriage, in a
species of half-voluptuous lassitude and abandonment;
but every change of posture was characterised
with an elegance of motion that might be
denominated poetic.</p>

<p>The equipage and its appointments were in the
best possible taste; and the liveries of the coachman
and attendant footman were plain and neat,
not glaring and obtrusive. Altogether, the “turn-out”
was that which a well-bred person, who knew
the distinction between elegant simplicity and
gaudy ostentation, was likely to possess.</p>

<p>The principal drive in the Champs Elys&eacute;es was
crowded to excess: seldom was there seen such a
quantity of carriages or such a number of gentlemen
on horseback. The foot-ways were likewise
thronged with loungers and with ladies enjoying
the afternoon’s promenade.</p>

<p>Laura’s carriage speedily fell into the line of
vehicles proceeding in the same direction;&mdash;and
now its progress was slow. This was just what
she wished: for not only was the multitude enabled
to obtain a better view of her&mdash;but she likewise
had more leisure to watch for the appearance
of <em>him</em> whom she expected to behold amidst the
gay throng. Thus both her vanity and her convenience
were successfully consulted at the same time.</p>

<p>Her patience was not put to a very lengthy nor
severe test: for, scarcely had her carriage reached
the mid-way point in the splendid avenue, when
her keen glance signalled out the object of her
thoughts from amidst the loungers on foot. Yes&mdash;there
indeed was Charles Hatfield&mdash;proceeding
at a short distance in advance of the carriage,
and in the same direction. The critical moment
was now almost at hand&mdash;and, though Laura’s
countenance still maintained its serenity, her heart
palpitated with violence. While, too, she seemed
to be reclining back in her carriage with a graceful
ease which we might almost denominate an elegant
languor,&mdash;and while she now more completely
shaded herself with her parasol,&mdash;her eyes were
fixed steadily and even intently in one direction.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;he has two friends with him,” she said to
herself: “they are all three in plain clothes&mdash;or
rather, in mourning&mdash;doubtless for the father-in-law
of their illustrious master.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had these thoughts flashed through
Laura’s brain, when Charles and his two companions
stopped&mdash;turned round&mdash;and gazed up and down
the avenue for a few moments: then they interchanged
some observations, and pursued their way.</p>

<p>Charles had not noticed Laura;&mdash;but <em>she</em> had
caught more than a partial glimpse of <em>his</em> face.
During the quarter of a minute that her eyes were
fixed upon him, she had as it were devoured him
with that earnest gaze. It was not love,&mdash;no&mdash;-and
it was not hate; but it was a species of ravenous
longing to decypher his thoughts through the medium
of his countenance. And she saw that he was
pale and pensive&mdash;but also strikingly handsome:
indeed, at that moment Laura fancied his manly
beauty had never before seemed so perfect in her
eyes&mdash;and it was with difficulty that she repressed
the sigh which rose almost to her lips.</p>

<p>A few minutes elapsed&mdash;and still the procession
of carriages moved on in the broad straight road;
and the tide of loungers on foot rolled along the
pathway. The distance between Laura and the object
of her thoughts was gradually diminishing; and
almost immediately her carriage would overtake
him and his companions. Again they turned&mdash;these
three gentlemen&mdash;and looked up and down; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
this time Laura rapidly scanned Hatfield’s two
friends. They were also young men of fine figure
and attractive looks: natives of Castelcicala, they
had the dark Italian complexion and the fine Italian
eyes;&mdash;and as they wore moustaches, their appearance
was more military than that of Charles. But
they were not so handsome as he;&mdash;at least Laura
thought so&mdash;and she was doubtless right.</p>

<p>The critical moment was now at hand: the carriage
overtook Hatfield and his Italian companions&mdash;and
it was just passing them, when Laura perceived
that she was suddenly recognised by her husband.
He started&mdash;stopped short&mdash;and kept his
eyes fixed upon her, as if doubting their evidence;
while his two friends, excited by his strange manner,
looked also in the same direction and at the
same object; and <em>their</em> gaze was likewise rivetted
immediately upon the beauteous woman whose
transcendent charms they naturally supposed to
have produced such an effect on their companion.
With a glance keen and rapid as lightning, Laura
perceived that she was the idol of attention on the
part of her husband and his two Italian friends,
though the latter dreamt not that she was even
known by name to Charles Hatfield: and while the
eyes of all three were thus intently fixed upon her,
her parasol suddenly escaped from her hand and
fell within a few paces of the young men,&mdash;unobserved
by the footman standing behind the carriage.</p>

<p>Of the two Castelcicalan officers, one was taller
and more classically handsome than the other:
and it was he that now darted forward to snatch
up the parasol and restore it to its charming
owner. So admirably had Laura managed the
dropping of the parasol, that it had all the appearance
of an accident to every one who observed the
circumstance&mdash;save Charles Hatfield: and, quickly
as the powder explodes after the match has been
applied to it, did the conviction flash to his brain
that the occurrence was intentional on the part of
Laura. Al the same instant it struck him that
never&mdash;never before had she appeared so marvellously
beautiful&mdash;never so transcendently lovely
as she now was,&mdash;with the flush of a gentle excitement
upon her cheeks&mdash;her hair dressed in a style
that he most admired&mdash;her pearly teeth partly
revealed between the roses of her lips&mdash;her toilette
so elegant and chaste, and setting off her splendid
form to its greatest advantage&mdash;and her attitude
so classically graceful, as she leant forward
to receive the parasol that the handsome Castelcicalan
now restored to her, after having carefully
brushed off the dust with his white cambric handkerchief.</p>

<p>A thousand&mdash;thousand conflicting thoughts
passed through the brain of Charles Hatfield during
the few seconds that had elapsed from the
escape of the parasol from her hand until its
restoration by the Italian:&mdash;he saw his wife more
beautiful than ever he had conceived her to be even
when he was accustomed to worship her image&mdash;he
remembered the witchery of her ways and the
melting music of her voice&mdash;the joys he had experienced
in her arms on the marriage night rushed to his
mind&mdash;and as his eyes dwelt perforce upon the rich
contours of her bust, he recollected that his head
had been pillowed and his hand had wandered
voluptuously there!</p>

<p>At the moment that Laura dropped her parasol,
the carriage stopped, and she affected to perceive
Charles Hatfield for the first time; and for a single
instant she appeared struck by surprise and uncertain
how to act:&mdash;then, immediately afterwards,
she averted her eyes from him, and bent them on the
handsome Castelcicalan who had sprung forward to
recover the parasol. She purposely composed her
countenance and modelled her behaviour, so that
her husband should be left in a state of utter uncertainty
and bewilderment as to what was passing in
her mind, at least in regard to himself:&mdash;but when
the Italian approached the carriage, took off his
hat, and with a low bow, presented the parasol
which he had so gallantly dusted with his cambric
handkerchief, Laura bestowed so sweet a smile and
so tender a look on the handsome foreigner, that the
direst rage which jealousy can know was excited in
a moment in the breast of Charles Hatfield.</p>

<p>A rapid glance&mdash;unseen even by her husband himself&mdash;made
Laura aware of the effect produced upon
him by her deportment towards the Castelcicalan;
and the joy of a proud triumph filled her heart.</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir,” she said in French to the
Italian gentleman;&mdash;for she had already learnt more
than enough of the language to be enabled to give
utterance to that common phrase;&mdash;and, as she
spoke, she again smiled sweetly, though not in a
manner which might be construed into indelicate
encouragement.</p>

<p>Her husband caught the words that were addressed
to the handsome foreigner, and also marked
the smile that accompanied them; and, as the music
of that voice flowed upon his ear, and the witchery
of that smile met his gaze, his countenance became
absolutely livid with the emotions that rent his
soul.</p>

<p>“Beautiful lady,” said the Castelcicalan, enchanted
by the condescending manner of the lovely
woman, who was agreeably surprised and much delighted
to hear him address her with the utmost
facility in the English language,&mdash;“you have
deigned to thank me for a thing so trivial that I am
ashamed to merit your notice upon so slight a
ground. Would that an opportunity could arise for
so humble an individual as myself to perform some
deed that might deserve your approval&mdash;and win
your gratitude,” added the Italian, sinking his voice
to a low tone.</p>

<p>“I know not, signor,” replied Laura, satisfying
herself with another rapid glance that Charles Hatfield
was still gazing with jealous fury upon this
scene,&mdash;“I know not, signor,” she said, with all the
witchery of tone and manner that she could summon
to her aid, “how I can sufficiently thank you for the
courteous behaviour which you demonstrate towards
me. At the same time, I need scarcely be astonished
at such chivalrous gallantry on your part&mdash;for, if I
mistake not, you belong to that fine Italian clime
which I shortly intend to visit.”</p>

<p>The young Castelcicalan gazed with the enthusiasm
of adoration up into the enchanting countenance
that was bending over him; and he felt as if
he could have cheerfully consented to yield up the
ten last years of his life to purchase the enjoyment
of pressing his lips to the small plump mouth which
looked redder than the rose moistened with the
dew of morning.</p>

<p>“Oh! is it possible,” he exclaimed, in a joyous
tone, “that you purpose to honour my native land
with your presence! Be assured, lady,” he continued,
“that if you visit Montoni, the Castelcicalan
capital, you will become the object of a perfect
idolatry.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>“Then should I do well to remain in France,
signor&mdash;rather than lead your nation into such a
crime,” said Laura, laughing gaily: and the rapid
glance which she darted towards her husband convinced
her that <em>he</em> was enduring the torments of the
damned&mdash;torments which were increasing in proportion
as she seemed to grow on more friendly
terms with the young Italian officer.</p>

<p>“I should be wretched indeed, beauteous lady,”
said he, in reply to her last observation, “did I
think that any inconsiderate remark from my lips
could deter you from carrying into effect a purpose
already settled in your mind. Neither,” he added,
with a sigh, “am I vain enough to suppose myself
to be of sufficient importance to sway you in one
way or another.”</p>

<p>“Nor am I vain enough to take in any sense save
as a compliment the flattering observation you made
just now relative to the reception I might expect at
Montoni;”&mdash;and as Laura uttered these words, she
cast down her eyes and blushed slightly.</p>

<p>The dialogue between the Castelcicalan and herself
had been carried on in a low tone, and was
therefore totally inaudible to the other Italian and
Charles Hatfield, who were gazing, but with very
different feelings, on the lovely woman. Neither
had the conversation occupied one tenth part of the
time which we have consumed in detailing it;&mdash;and
in the interval, the carriages originally behind that
of Laura, had passed hers by, so that the stoppage
of her equipage caused no obstruction. The tide of
pedestrian loungers was likewise still flowing on&mdash;there
being nothing singular nor unusual in the
fact of a gentleman on foot paying his respects to a
lady who rode in her carriage.</p>

<p>But while the multitude, generally, saw naught
peculiar in the scene which we are describing, it
was nevertheless one of deep interest. By the carriage
door stood the young Castelcicalan officer, his
heart throbbing with the ineffable emotions which
the wondrous beauty of Laura had excited, as it
were by the wave of an enchanter’s wand;&mdash;in the vehicle
itself sate the syren&mdash;bending forward towards
that handsome foreigner as if she were already interested
in him, though in reality she experienced
not the slightest sensual feeling in his favour&mdash;other
considerations occupying her thoughts:&mdash;at a little
distance stood the other Italian officer, gazing upon
her with an admiration which he could not conceal,
and envying his comrade the privilege which
a lucky accident had given him to address the houri;&mdash;and
there also was Charles Hatfield&mdash;ghastly
pale, his limbs trembling convulsively, and his lips
white and quivering with rage.</p>

<p>Yes: terrible&mdash;terrible were the feelings which
Laura’s husband experienced for the six or eight
minutes that this scene lasted. There was a woman
whose beauty excited universal admiration,&mdash;a woman
in all the splendour of female loveliness;&mdash;and
this woman was <em>his</em> wife&mdash;his own wedded wife,&mdash;a
wife whom he could rush forward and claim in a
moment, if he chose! And that woman was now
coquetting before his eyes&mdash;coquetting with a studied
purpose to annoy him. Oh! he could understand
it all,&mdash;the means which had been adopted to induce
him and his two companions to proceed to the
Champs Elys&eacute;es at that hour&mdash;the pretended accident
of the parasol&mdash;and the smiles and tender looks
which Laura now bestowed upon one who was entirely
a stranger to her:&mdash;yes&mdash;all, all was now
clear to Charles Hatfield,&mdash;and he was on the point
of springing forward&mdash;not to catch Laura to his
breast and claim her as his spouse&mdash;but to upbraid
and expose her,&mdash;when he suddenly recollected
that a portion of the agreement entered into between
his father and her, was to the effect that <em>she</em>
likewise was to be secure against molestation or
recognition on <em>his</em> part, as well as he on hers. This
reminiscence compelled the unhappy young man to
restrain his feelings; and as he was forced to subdue
his ire, his jealousy only became the more painful,
because it required a vent of some kind or another.
He writhed&mdash;he positively writhed before her eyes;&mdash;and
now he was humiliated as well as tortured to
such an intolerable degree!</p>

<p>Laura had cast down her looks and had called up
a blush to her smooth cheeks, when she made to
the handsome Castelcicalan the remark that we
have last recorded: but almost immediately afterwards
she raised her countenance again, and smiling
with an archness so enchantingly sweet that
it would have moved the rigid features of an octogenarian
anchorite to admiration, she said: “At
all events, signor, should I visit Montoni in the
course of this summer, my stay would be very
short&mdash;for I purpose to become a great traveller,
and to travel very rapidly also. To-morrow I set
out for Vienna.”</p>

<p>“Vienna!” repeated the Castelcicalan, in astonishment.
“Surely Paris possesses greater attractions
than the cold, dull, formal Austrian
capital?”</p>

<p>“Oh! of that I must judge for myself,” exclaimed
Laura, laughing&mdash;at the same time showing
by her manner that she thought their conversation
had lasted long enough.</p>

<p>The young Italian was too well-bred to attempt
to detain her: but it was nevertheless with evident
reluctance that he stepped back from the carriage-door
and raised his hat in farewell salutation.
Laura inclined her head gracefully in acknowledgment
of his courtesy, and the vehicle drove on
rapidly, the way before it being now comparatively
clear.</p>

<p>Oh! what triumph was in her heart, as she threw
herself back in the carriage and reflected upon all
the incidents of the scene that had just occurred,&mdash;a
scene which had not occupied ten minutes, and
which had nevertheless stirred up so many and
such varied feelings! Her vanity had been gratified
by the homage paid to her beauty; and her malignity
had for the time been assuaged by the contemplation
of the almost mortal agonies endured by her
husband. She had asserted the empire of her
charms over even the very heart that ought to cherish
hatred against her: she had inspired with the maddest
jealousy the soul that was bound to think of
her with loathing and abhorrence. She felt all the
pride of a woman wielding a sceptre more despotic
than that of a queen,&mdash;a sceptre which was as a
magic wand in her hand, casting spells upon even
those who detested, as well as those who admired
her!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXIII">CHAPTER CLXIII.<br />

<span class="medium">LAURA AND ROSALIE.</span></h2>

<p>Yes&mdash;it was a great triumph for Laura Mortimer,&mdash;a
triumph all the greater, inasmuch as she knew
that the agitation and rage of her husband could not
speedily pass away; and that, when his friends had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
leisure to observe his emotions and seek an explanation,
he would not dare to afford them any!</p>

<div id="i_225" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_225.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>She had, moreover, made statements to the young
Castelcicalan which he would doubtless repeat to
Charles Hatfield, whom they were well calculated
to mystify relative to her future proceedings; for
the reader scarcely requires to be told that she had
not the slightest intention to repair to Vienna nor
to visit Italy.</p>

<p>In every respect she had ample reason to be well
satisfied with the results of the scheme she had devised
in the morning and so effectually carried out
in the afternoon,&mdash;a scheme so wild and having so
many thousand chances against its success, that none
save the intrepid, resolute, far-seeing Laura could
have possibly hoped to conduct it to a triumphant
issue.</p>

<p>Having proceeded to the end of the avenue, she
ordered the coachman to retrace his way and return
home;&mdash;but she was not destined to reach the Rue
Monthabor without experiencing another adventure,
which may for the moment seem trivial, but
which was nevertheless destined to exercise no
mean amount of influence upon her future career.</p>

<p>As the carriage was emerging from the Champs
Elys&eacute;es, two gentlemen on horseback, just entering
the fashionable lounge, were about to pass by, when
one of them, recognising Laura, suddenly pulled up
and made her a low bow. She immediately ordered
the carriage to stop; for it was her courteous and
obliging friend the professor of music, who had thus
saluted her&mdash;and she was anxious to express to him
the delight she had experienced from a perusal of
the translations he had sent to her the preceding
evening. After the exchange of the usual complimentary
remarks, the professor, turning towards
his companion, said, “My lord, permit me to introduce
you to one of my fair pupils&mdash;my fairest pupil,
I should rather observe,” he added, in a good-tempered
manner: “Miss Laura Mortimer&mdash;the Marquis
of Delmour.”</p>

<p>Laura was startled for an instant at finding her
music-master in such aristocratic society; and as
she inclined gracefully in acknowledgment of the
nobleman’s courteous salutation, she observed that
his lordship was an elderly, if not actually an old
man, but that his countenance was far from disagreeable.</p>

<p>A brief conversation ensued; and although the
marquis had no opportunity of speaking more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
a dozen words, and even those on common topic
Laura nevertheless saw enough of him to be convinced
that his manners were of polished elegance,
and that his disposition was frank and unassuming.</p>

<p>It was not therefore without emotions of secret
pleasure that she heard herself thus addressed by
the professor of music:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Miss Mortimer, his lordship, and myself, are old
acquaintances, and he permits me to call him my
friend. His lordship will honour my humble
abode with his presence, to-morrow, evening:
there will be a musical soir&eacute;e of the same unpretending
kind as that which you yourself graced
with your company the evening before last. My
wife will doubtless send you the formal card; but
may I in a less ceremonial fashion, solicit you to
favour us with your presence?”</p>

<p>Laura signified the pleasure she should experience
in accepting the invitation; and all the time she
was listening to the professor and replying to him,
she had the agreeable consciousness that the marquis
was gazing upon her with an admiration which
he could not repress. She however affected not to
be in the slightest degree aware that she was undergoing
such an impassioned survey; and when she
turned towards his lordship to make the parting
bow, it was with the formal reserve and yet graceful
dignity of a lady to whom a stranger has only
just been introduced.</p>

<p>The carriage rolled on in one direction&mdash;the horsemen
pursued their way in another;&mdash;and while the
Marquis of Delmour was putting innumerable
questions to his friend relative to the houri whom
they had thus met, Laura was on her side resolving
that Rosalie should without delay institute all possible
inquiries respecting the position, fortune, and
character of that nobleman.</p>

<p>We should here remind the reader that the professor
of music was a man eminent in his special
sphere, of high respectability, and great moral worth;
and, moreover, he was a native of a country where
talent is prized and looked up to, instead of being
merely tolerated and looked down upon. It is not,
therefore, extraordinary if we find him moving in
the best society, and having his entertainments attended
by the <em>elite</em> of the residents or visitors in the
gay city of Paris.</p>

<p>On her return home to her splendid apartments
in the Rue Monthabor, Laura was immediately
waited upon by her lady’s-maid; and while the mistress
was changing her attire in preparation for
dinner, the dependant explained the means by which
she had induced Charles Hatfield and the two Italian
officers in the suite of the Grand Duke to repair
to the Champs Elys&eacute;es in company, and at the hour
specified by Laura.</p>

<p>“When you first mentioned your desire to me this
morning, <em>mademoiselle</em>,” began Rosalie, “I must confess
that I was somewhat embarrassed how to accomplish
the scheme; although I did not despair. But
when I saw the paragraph in the paper, and ascertained
the hotel at which the Grand Duke and his
suite had taken up their temporary abode, I suddenly
remembered that a day or two ago I met a
young woman who had formerly been my fellow-servant,
and that she was now filling a situation in
that very hotel. This circumstance inspired me
with a hope of success; and we Frenchwomen look
upon an intrigue as being as good as carried successfully
out, when it affords a hope to encourage
us. Therefore did I promise you so confidently;
and I lost no time in proceeding to the hotel. I
soon found my friend, who is a chamber-maid there;
and I told her just sufficient&mdash;without, however,
mentioning your name or even alluding to you,
<em>mademoiselle</em>&mdash;to induce her to afford me her assistance.
Some of the officers of the Grand Duke’s
suite were lounging in the court-yard of the hotel
at the time; and my friend pointed them out to me
one by one, naming each as she proceeded. I resolved
to choose the two youngest and handsomest
to be Mr. Charles Hatfield’s companions, <em>mademoiselle</em>;
because,” continued Rosalie, with an arch
smile, “I tolerably well understood the entire
nature of the project which you had in contemplation.”</p>

<p>“You are marvellously sharp-witted and keen-sighted,
Rosalie,” said Laura, laughing good-humouredly.
“But pray proceed. What step did
you adopt next, after having thus passed the Grand
Duke’s suite in a review of which they were however
unconscious?”</p>

<p>“I must confess, <em>mademoiselle</em>,” resumed Rosalie,
“that I was somewhat puzzled how to act. But
suddenly an idea struck me; and, however ridiculous
the plan may now appear to you, your own lips
can proclaim whether it succeeded or not. In fact,
I calculated upon the romantic disposition which
the Italians are known to possess; and I also reflected
that as Mr. Charles Hatfield, whom I likewise
saw at the hotel (though he saw not me) appeared
pensive and thoughtful, he would embark in
any adventure that promised to wean his thoughts
from their melancholy mood, and that offered some
excitement of a novel character. I accordingly
penned a note, addressed to Mr. Charles Hatfield,
Captain Barthelma, and Lieutenant Di Ponta&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is the name of the taller and handsomer of
the two officers who accompanied Charles?” asked
Laura, with a slight kindling of sensual feeling as
she recalled to mind the pleasing features of the
Italian who had picked up her parasol, and with
whom she had exchanged the few complimentary
observations already recorded.</p>

<p>“That one is Captain Barthelma,” answered
Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Proceed,” said Laura. “You were telling me
that you penned a note&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To the three gentlemen collectively,” added the
lady’s-maid;&mdash;“and, as nearly as I can remember,
the contents ran thus:&mdash;‘To Mr. Charles Hatfield,
Captain Barthelma, and Lieutenant Di Ponta, an
unhappy Spanish refugee ventures to address himself,
having certain excellent reasons for being well
aware that they will not refuse to listen to his sad
tale, and interest themselves in his behalf. But as
he is an object of suspicion to the French government,
he dares not make his appearance at the
hotel where a prince, who is known to be the redresser
of wrongs, has taken up his abode. He
will therefore walk this afternoon, from four to
five, on the right hand of the central avenue of the
Champs Elys&eacute;es; and if the three gentlemen to
whom he now addresses his humble but earnest
application, will be at the place and time appointed,
the unhappy writer of this petition will
make himself known to them&mdash;will explain his
business frankly&mdash;and will indicate the means by
which he can be restored to wealth and happiness.
Those means consist in one word which it will be
for His Sovereign Highness the Grand Duke to
speak, and which can only be spoken at the instigation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
of the three gentlemen to whom this letter
is addressed.’”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I give you credit for your stratagem!”
exclaimed Laura, laughing heartily. “I have
no doubt that Charles sees through it <em>now</em>: but he
will not dare to give any explanations to his friends,”
she added, in a musing tone. “They will imagine
that they have been duped by some humorous person&mdash;and
he will affect to fall into the same way of
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Or else the two Italian gentlemen will suppose
that the poor refugee was prevented, by some misadventure,
from keeping the appointment,” observed
Rosalie, now giving way to her mirth to such a degree
that the tears came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;make an end of your story,” said Laura,
who had nearly completed her toilette; for, although
she expected no one that evening, she nevertheless
made it a rule to dress herself with the utmost care
in case of a visit on the part of any of those persons
whose acquaintance she had recently formed.</p>

<p>“I have little more to tell you, <em>mademoiselle</em>,
responded Rosalie. “My friend, the chambermaid,
left the note, which was duly sealed and properly
addressed to the three gentlemen, upon the
table of Captain Barthelma’s private apartment;
and soon afterwards that officer went to his room.
I waited at the hotel in the hope of ascertaining the
effect that the <em>billet</em> would produce; and in a short
time the captain returned in haste to his companions,
who were still lounging in the court-yard&mdash;some
of them giving directions to their grooms, and
others smoking cigars. From the window of my
friend’s chamber, I beheld Captain Barthelma draw
Mr. Charles Hatfield and Lieutenant Di Ponta
aside, and show them the letter. They evidently
perused it with great attention; and I felt assured
by their manner that they treated the affair seriously.
I now requested my friend to hurry down stairs,
and traverse the yard as if in pursuance of her avocations&mdash;but
to pass as near the little group as
possible, and endeavour to catch any remarks that
they might be exchanging at the moment. This she
did; and she heard quite enough to convince her
that the appointment would be kept. I then retraced
my way homeward, and was happy in being
able to give you the assurance, <em>mademoiselle</em>, that
your wishes would be fully gratified so far as the
result depended upon me.”</p>

<p>“You are a good girl, Rosalie,” said Laura; “and
I shall not be unmindful of the service you have
thus rendered me. But I now require your aid in
another matter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Speak, my dear lady: I am entirely at your disposal,”
observed the dependant, who, in proportion
as she obtained a farther insight into the character
of her mistress, felt the more certain of reaping
a fine harvest of rewards, bribes, and hush-money.</p>

<p>“There is in Paris at this moment an English
nobleman concerning whom I am desirous that you
should obtain as much information as you can possibly
glean, without creating any suspicion or in
any way compromising me. I allude to the Marquis
of Delmour,” continued Laura: “but I know
not where he is residing; nor can I offer the least
suggestion to guide you in instituting your inquiries.”</p>

<p>“Leave all that to me, <em>mademoiselle</em>,” said
Rosalie.</p>

<p>“There is no time to be lost,” observed Laura,
“this evening, or in the course of to-morrow, must
I have the information which I seek.”</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit of letting the grass grow
beneath my feet,” replied the French dependant,
with an arch smile. “The moment you have sat
down to dinner, <em>mademoiselle</em>, I will sally forth;
and should I not return until a somewhat late
hour&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No matter,” interrupted Laura: “I shall know
that you are employed in my interests. Unless,
indeed,” she added, laughing, “you possess a lover
whose company may prove more agreeable to you
than the task with which I have entrusted you.”</p>

<p>“I have no lover in Paris&mdash;at present, <em>mademoiselle</em>,”
observed Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Then you admit that you have had a lover in
your life-time?” said Laura.</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly, <em>mademoiselle</em>,” exclaimed the
pretty Frenchwoman: “and&mdash;to speak candidly&mdash;I
could not without some trouble reckon the number
of those who have proclaimed themselves my
admirers.”</p>

<p>“The name of your lovers is Legion, then?”
cried Laura, again laughing: but it was the natural
sensuality of her disposition which impelled her
thus to interrogate her servant;&mdash;for a licentious
woman experiences a voluptuous enjoyment in
learning that another is as amorously inclined or
as downright abandoned as herself. And now that
Laura’s spite against Charles Hatfield was for the
time appeased, and she had leisure to ponder upon
the handsome countenance and elegant figure of
Captain Barthelma, her imagination was becoming
inflamed, and wanton ideas and aspirations rose up
in her brain.</p>

<p>“Oh! <em>mademoiselle</em>,” exclaimed Rosalie, with an
archness of expression that made her countenance
particularly interesting at the moment; “you must
think me very vain and very silly for having made
the remark which fell so inconsiderately from my
lips!”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” observed Laura: “you are pretty
enough to have captivated many hearts. And now
tell me, my dear girl&mdash;have you passed through
such an ordeal without leaving your virtue behind?
Be frank and candid: I wish to know you
thoroughly, that I may determine how far I can
trust you.”</p>

<p>“I dare say, <em>mademoiselle</em>, that you can form a
tolerably accurate guess in that respect,” said
Rosalie, in a low tone and with a blushing countenance.
“Were I to tell you that I am pure and chaste,
you would not believe me, <em>mademoiselle</em>&mdash;and&mdash;and,
you would be right.”</p>

<p>“Suppose, then, that you had suddenly conceived
a great fancy for a very handsome young man,
Rosalie?” said Laura, her bosom heaving voluptuously
as she gradually approached the aim and object
of the present conversation.</p>

<p>“I should take care to let him perceive that if
he chose to solicit, it would not be in vain,” answered
Rosalie, who already comprehended that
her mistress was not giving the discourse this turn
without some definite end in view.</p>

<p>“And you would be deeply grateful,” continued
Laura, in a low but significant tone, “to any friend
who might assist you in the management of the
intrigue?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly, <em>mademoiselle</em>” replied the Frenchwoman:
“the more so that I myself should delight
in rendering <em>my</em> aid when and where the services
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
of so humble a being as I am could prove available.”</p>

<p>“Those services may be made available this very
evening,” said Laura, a voluptuous glow spreading
over her fine countenance, while her eyes became
soft and melting in expression. “You must aid
me, Rosalie, in gratifying an ardent longing which
has sprung up within my bosom during the last few
minutes, and which I may vainly struggle to subdue.
But the intrigue requires so much delicate
management&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I can anticipate all you would say, <em>mademoiselle</em>,”
interrupted Rosalie: then, in a significant tone,
she added, “Captain Barthelma is decidedly one of
the handsomest men I ever saw in my life.”</p>

<p>“You have conjectured rightly,” said Laura;
“you have penetrated my thoughts! Can you&mdash;will
you serve me in the gratification of this caprice of
mine? But, remember&mdash;I must not be compromised
in respect to a living soul save Barthelma
and yourself.”</p>

<p>“You know, <em>mademoiselle</em>, that you can trust to
my fidelity, my sagacity, and my prudence,” said
Rosalie. “At what hour shall the handsome Italian
visit you?”</p>

<p>“At nine&mdash;this evening,” answered Laura: then
referring to her watch, she added, “It is already six&mdash;and
you have plenty of work upon your hands!”</p>

<p>“I will neglect nothing,” observed the lady’s-maid,
in a tone of confidence. “Would it not be prudent
to send the cook out of the way for the evening?
For as the men-servants are on board-wages and
sleep elsewhere, and the cook is therefore the only
dependant who could possibly observe your proceedings,
<em>mademoiselle</em>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I leave all this to you, Rosalie,” interrupted
Laura;&mdash;“and now we have nothing more to say
to each other for the present. Order the dinner to
be served up at once&mdash;and then must you hasten to
fulfil the commissions with which you are charged.”</p>

<p>Having thus given her parting instructions, Laura
repaired to the dining-room, where an elegant repast
was speedily spread upon the table; and a glass of
sparkling champagne soon enhanced the brilliancy
of the voluptuous woman’s eyes, and heightened the
rich glow that suffused her countenance.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, a choice dessert was
served up; and Laura was now left alone.</p>

<p>She was almost sorry that she had gone so far in
respect to the intrigue which was to bring the handsome
Castelcicalan to her arms: she had admitted
Rosalie too deeply into her confidence&mdash;placed herself
too completely in the power of her dependant. Even
while she was conversing with the wily
Frenchwoman, she perceived and felt all this;&mdash;but
her sensuality triumphed over her prudence&mdash;her
lascivious temperament carried her on with a force
which she could not resist, much less subdue.</p>

<p>“And, after all,” she now reasoned to herself,
“wherefore should I not follow my inclinations in
this respect? I am free to act according to the
impulse of my passions and the prompting of my
desires. The night that I passed with Charles&mdash;that
one night of love and bliss&mdash;has revived those
ardent longings, those burning thoughts that demand
gratification. Besides, Rosalie will be trustworthy
so long as she is well paid; and I shall take
care to keep her purse well filled. Sooner or later
she must have obtained a complete insight into my
character: why not, then, at once as well as hereafter?
And the more firmly I bind her to my interests,
the less shall I need the services of my crafty,
selfish old mother. Would that I could manage my
affairs and execute my plans without my parent’s
aid altogether! And who knows but that even this
consummation may be reached? Something tells
me that the Marquis of Delmour and I shall yet
be more intimately acquainted. He is old&mdash;but that
is of little consequence. Wealth and a proud position
are my aims&mdash;and I care not by what means
they are acquired. Oh! the happiness of possessing
such beauty as that wherewith I am endowed,&mdash;a
beauty which can never fail to crown me with
triumph in all my schemes!&mdash;in all my projects!”</p>

<p>She now regarded her watch, and discovered that
it was eight o’clock.</p>

<p>“In another hour he will be here,” she thought
within herself; and her bosom heaved voluptuously.
“Yes&mdash;in another hour that handsome Italian will
be in my presence&mdash;at least, if Rosalie fulfil her
task with her wonted sagacity and prudence. What
will he think of me? Oh! let him entertain any
opinion that he may: I will bind him to secrecy by
the most solemn oaths&mdash;and I read enough in his
countenance to convince me that he is a man of
honour!”</p>

<p>In this strain did the lovely but wanton creature
pursue her reflections, until it was nearly nine
o’clock.</p>

<p>She then rose from her seat, and repaired to the
kitchen, which was on the same floor as her suite of
apartments. The cook was not there; and Laura
was consequently satisfied that Rosalie had not
forgotten the precaution herself had suggested.</p>

<p>The syren now proceeded to the drawing-room,
where with her own fair hands she arranged wine,
fruits, and cakes upon the table. She then drew the
curtains over the window, lighted the wax candles
upon the mantel, and scattered drops of delicious
perfume upon the carpet and the drapery.</p>

<p>Scarcely were these preparations completed,
when the bell of the outer door of the suite rang
as if pulled by a somewhat impatient hand; and
Laura hastened to answer the summons.</p>

<p>She opened the door&mdash;and Captain Barthelma,
the handsome Castelcicalan, appeared upon the
threshold.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that this can be true!” he exclaimed,
his joy amounting to a delirious excitement
as his eyes fell upon the heroine of the afternoon’s
adventure in the Champs Elys&eacute;es.</p>

<p>Laura smiled archly as she placed her finger
upon her lip to impose silence, at least until he
should have entered her abode; and, having closed
the door carefully, she conducted him into the
drawing-room.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXIV">CHAPTER CLXIV.<br />

<span class="medium">LAURA’S AMOUR.</span></h2>

<p>Seating herself upon the sofa, Laura motioned
the Italian to place himself by her side&mdash;an invitation
which he obeyed with a species of enthusiastic
alacrity. But all the time he was unable to take
his eyes off her&mdash;as if he still doubted whether it
were indeed a fact that his good fortune had conducted
him into the presence of her whose image
had never once been absent from his mind since he
first beheld her that afternoon in the Champs
Elys&eacute;es.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” he again ejaculated, after a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
minutes’ silence. “The young woman promised
me that if I were discreet, I might expect the happiness
of meeting you&mdash;yes, <em>you</em>, sweetest lady&mdash;again:
but I confess that I doubted her&mdash;and I came
that I might not throw away a chance of felicity,
rather than in the sanguine hope of attaining it.”</p>

<p>“And, when you have leisure for reflection” said
Laura, casting down her eyes and blushing, “you
will despise me for my imprudence&mdash;my indelicacy
of conduct in thus sending to invite a stranger to
visit me.”</p>

<p>“Adorable woman!” exclaimed the impassioned
Italian; “I shall think of you with gratitude&mdash;with
devotion&mdash;with love,&mdash;and never lightly. Oh! be
assured of <em>that</em>!”&mdash;and, seizing her hand, he conveyed
it to his lips, and covered it with kisses.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you must be surprised at my boldness
in directing my servant to seek you, and to
make this appointment with you,” pursued Laura,
her bosom heaving so as almost to burst from its
confinement, as she felt the warm mouth of the
Castelcicalan glued to the hand which she did not
attempt to withdraw.</p>

<p>“I am only surprised at my own happiness,” observed
the young officer. “Sweetest Laura&mdash;for I
now know your name&mdash;tell me how I have thus
been deemed worthy of a favour of which a prince
might envy me the enjoyment!”</p>

<p>“An accident threw us together for a few minutes
this afternoon,” said Laura; “and I was struck by
your personal appearance&mdash;your manners&mdash;your
conversation&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And, oh! how profoundly was I impressed by
the magic of your beauty, Laura!” interrupted the
ardent Italian; “how earnestly I longed to hear
once more the music of that melodious voice&mdash;to
look again into the depths of those magnificent eyes&mdash;to
contemplate that glorious countenance&mdash;that
admirable form;&mdash;and now&mdash;oh! now the desire is
realised&mdash;and no human language has words powerful
enough to convey to you an idea of the happiness
which I experience at this moment!”</p>

<p>As he thus spoke he threw his arms around her
waist, and drew her towards him.</p>

<p>“Charming creature!” he exclaimed, after a few
moments’ pause, during which he gazed upon her
with a rapture which can only be conceived and
not explained: “how can I make thee comprehend
the extent of my love&mdash;my adoration&mdash;my worship?
I have travelled much&mdash;have seen beauties of all
climes and of all varieties of loveliness;&mdash;but never
did mine eyes settle upon one so transcendently
charming as thou! When I parted from thee this
afternoon in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, it was as if I were
tearing myself away from some one whom I had
loved all my life, and whom I was never to see
again. I was a second Adam, expelled from another
Eden! And now&mdash;now, I behold thee once more&mdash;I
am seated in thy presence&mdash;thou smilest upon
me&mdash;&mdash;oh! it is heaven&mdash;it is heaven!”&mdash;and, as if
in a transport of fury&mdash;so impassioned was his soul&mdash;he
drew her still closer towards him, and literally
seizing her head with both his hands, glued his
lips to hers&mdash;sucking in her very breath.</p>

<p>Intoxicated with sensual happiness, Laura offered
no resistance to the ardour of the handsome
young man; but ere she completely yielded herself
up to him, she remembered that something was
due to prudence as well as to the delights of love.</p>

<p>Accordingly, withdrawing herself from his embrace,
though still permitting his arm to encircle
her waist, she said, “I can refuse you nothing; but
first swear, by all you deem most sacred, that you
will never betray me!”</p>

<p>“Never&mdash;never!” ejaculated Barthelma; “I take
God to witness that my lips shall never breathe a
word injurious to your honour! On the contrary,”
he cried, in a tone of deep sincerity, “should I ever
hear a man speak lightly of you, I will provoke him
to a duel that shall terminate only in the death of
one&mdash;if not both; and should a woman dare to
mention your name irreverently, I will even fabricate
a tale injurious to <em>her</em> honour, that I may
avenge <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“Thanks&mdash;a thousand thanks, my generous
friend!” murmured Laura, one of her white hands
playing with the long, dark, curling hair of the
Castelcicalan. “But may you not&mdash;in an unguarded
moment&mdash;when carousing, perhaps, with your
brother-officers,&mdash;may you not inadvertently allude
to the adventure which happened to you in Paris,
and then be unconsciously drawn out&mdash;under the
influence of wine&mdash;to make revelations which will
prove the ruin&mdash;the utter ruin&mdash;of the weak, but
confiding woman who trusts so much to your
honour this night?”</p>

<p>“May my tongue blister&mdash;may lightnings strike
me&mdash;may I be cast down a corpse at the feet of
those to whom I ever open my lips to speak irreverently
or ungratefully of thee!” exclaimed the
Italian, with a terrible energy. “No&mdash;my adored
Laura! you have not the slightest ground for apprehensions
of that nature. I am a man of honour&mdash;and
I would rather shed the last drop of my blood
to serve thee, than raise a finger to harm thee.
Beautiful creature&mdash;adorable woman! who that
possesses a spark of human feeling, could do aught
to bring a tear into thine eye or chase away the
smile from thy lips? I am thy slave, Laura&mdash;and I
rejoice in wearing the chains which thy magic
loveliness has cast around me!”</p>

<p>In this impassioned strain did the Italian pour
forth his adoration; and, as Laura gazed upon him
with eyes swimming in very wantonness, she
thought that he was far more handsome than she
had fancied him to be in the afternoon, or even
when he had first appeared before her that evening.</p>

<p>He, too, on his part, found the syren a thousand
times more witching&mdash;more beauteous&mdash;more attractive
than she had seemed in her carriage; and
yet even then he had been ready to fall down and
worship her. Now he beheld her in a light evening
toilette&mdash;with naked neck and naked arms,&mdash;no
scarf&mdash;not even the most transparent gauze veiling
her shoulders of alabaster whiteness,&mdash;and with her
hair dressed in massive curls, instead of hyperion
ringlets;&mdash;now, too, he could perceive, by the undulations
of her attire, that her limbs were turned
with a symmetry that was elegant and yet robust&mdash;admirable
in shape, though full in their proportions.</p>

<p>“I thank you most sincerely for the assurances
of secrecy which you have given me,” said Laura, in
the sweetest, most melting cadence of her delicious
voice; “likewise for the chivalrous professions with
which you have coupled them. You declare yourself
to be my slave,” she added; “but it will be for
this night only!”</p>

<p>And she hid her countenance on his breast, as if
ashamed of the invitation which her words implied&mdash;an
invitation that welcomed him at her abode
until the morning!</p>

<p>“In one sense I understand you, my charmer,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
he said, kissing her beauteous head as it lay reclining
on his bosom; “and that alone ought to be
happiness sufficient for me! But I am greedy&mdash;I
am covetous; and I demand more! Listen, adored
Laura&mdash;grant me your patience for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>She raised her head, and gazed tenderly up into
his animated countenance as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I am not a rich man,” he continued; “but I
possess a competency&mdash;nay, a handsome competency;
and I care not how soon I abandon the service
of even so good and excellent a prince as his
Sovereign Highness&mdash;in order to devote myself
wholly and solely to you. I know not who you are&mdash;I
only know that you are the loveliest creature
on the face of God’s earth, and that your name is
Laura Mortimer. Neither do I seek to know more.
But I am ready and anxious to join my fortunes
with yours&mdash;to marry you, if you will accept me as
your husband,&mdash;or to become your slave&mdash;your
menial! Tell me not, then, that we must part to-morrow:
oh! let me remain with you, my charming
Laura, until death shall separate us!”</p>

<p>“It cannot be, my handsome Barthelma!” murmured
Laura. “But let me call you by your Christian
name&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” said the Castelcicalan.</p>

<p>“You are, then, my handsome Lorenzo for this
night&mdash;and for this night only,” continued Laura,
throwing her warm, plump, exquisitely modelled
arms about his neck, and pressing her lips to his
glowing cheek.</p>

<p>“Cruel&mdash;cruel Laura!” he exclaimed, returning
the ardent caress.</p>

<p>“Oh! would that circumstances permitted&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No circumstances can separate us, if you should
decide that we are to remain together,” interrupted
the Castelcicalan, in an impassioned tone.</p>

<p>“Alas! you know not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you are already a wife, I will kill your husband,”
cried Lorenzo, again speaking with vehement
abruptness: “If you are engaged to wed one whom
you dislike, I will dare him to wrest you from my
arms;&mdash;and if you have relations&mdash;father or brothers&mdash;whom
you imagine yourself bound to consult, you
may rest well assured that in preferring my love to
that of kith and kin you will be receiving the purest
gold in exchange for comparative dross.”</p>

<p>“Dear Lorenzo, I must seal your eloquent lips
with kisses,” said Laura, with an arch playfulness
that was also full of wantonness: “yes&mdash;I must
seal those red, moist lips,” she murmured, after
having pressed her mouth to his; “or you will persuade
me to give an affirmative answer to your endearing
solicitations&mdash;and that would only be to
record a promise to-night which I most break to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Are you, then, my angel, the mistress of some
man on whose wealth you are dependent, or in
whose power circumstances have placed you?” demanded
the impassioned Italian, with more fervid
frankness than considerate delicacy.</p>

<p>“I am not&mdash;I never was&mdash;and I never shall be a
pensioned mistress, Lorenzo!” answered Laura, her
manner becoming suddenly haughty.</p>

<p>“Pardon me&mdash;Oh! I implore you to pardon me,
my angel!” exclaimed the young officer, straining
her to his chest. “Not for worlds would I offend
you&mdash;not even to save my soul from perdition would
I wrong you by word or deed! Tell me, Laura&mdash;tell
me&mdash;Laura&mdash;tell me&mdash;am I forgiven?”</p>

<p>She raised her countenance towards his own,
and when their lips met she sealed his pardon with
a long, burning kiss.</p>

<p>“And now,” she said, “do not ask me again to do
that which is impossible. I cannot marry you, although
I am not married&mdash;I cannot be your mistress,
although I am not the mistress of another&mdash;I
cannot hold out any hope to you, although I am
pledged to none other.”</p>

<p>“You are as enigmatical as you are charming&mdash;you
are as mysterious as you are beautiful!” exclaimed
Lorenzo, contemplating his fair companion
with the most enthusiastic rapture.</p>

<p>“And it is not now for you to mar the pleasure
which we enjoy in each other’s society, by seeking
to render me less enigmatical or less mysterious,”
observed the syren. “At the same time I cannot
be otherwise than flattered by the proposals you
have made to me, and the generous manner in which
you have expressed yourself in my behalf. Come&mdash;let
us drink a glass of champagne to enhance the
happiness of the moment, and drown careful reflections.”</p>

<p>“Be it so, my charmer,” said Lorenzo: “and if I
no more torment you with my entreaties&mdash;if I resolve
to content myself with the amount of bliss
which you have promised me,&mdash;nevertheless, my
dearest&mdash;ever dearest Laura, I shall take leave of
you to-morrow morning with the fervent hope that
we shall shortly meet again. You told me this
afternoon that you proposed to visit Montoni in the
course of the ensuing autumn&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I have no doubt that I shall be enabled to
fulfil that promise,” interrupted Laura, by way of
changing the topic of discourse. “And now that
you have given me to understand that you will not
revive the useless but flattering, and, in some sense,
agreeable proposals you made me just now, let us
think only of the enjoyment of the present.”</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say, my angel,” returned Lorenzo;
and he forthwith filled a glass with sparkling
champagne, which he handed to his fair companion.</p>

<p>She quaffed it at a draught, and a flood of light
seemed to suffuse her entire countenance, and render
her eyes brilliant as diamonds: her lips, too,
moist with the generous juice, acquired a deeper red&mdash;and
her bosom panted with amorous longings.</p>

<p>Lorenzo beheld the effects of the rich fluid, and
hastened to fill the glass again: then, ere he drained
it of its contents, he studiously placed to his lips
the side which Laura’s mouth had touched.</p>

<p>“You had two friends with you this afternoon
in the Champs Elys&eacute;es?” said the syren, interrogatively,
when they were once more seated, half-embraced
in each other’s arms, upon the sofa.</p>

<p>“Yes: one was a fellow-countryman of mine&mdash;the
other a native of your land, my beloved,” answered
Lorenzo. “But I must tell you the singular
adventure that occurred to us: and, indeed,”
he added, with a smile, “I am deeply indebted to
a certain anonymous correspondent&mdash;for had it not
been through him, I should not have this day visited
the scene where I was fortunate enough to encounter
you.”</p>

<p>“A singular adventure!” exclaimed Laura, with
an admirable affectation of the most ingenuous
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Judge for yourself, my angel,” replied Lorenzo
then, taking Rosalie’s letter from his pocket, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
handed it to Laura, who, consuming with strong
desires though she were, could scarcely suppress a
laugh as she perused the <em>billet</em>, with the contents
of which she was already so well acquainted.</p>

<p>“And did you see the poor man who addressed
you and your friends in this wild, romantic style?”
she asked, restoring him the note.</p>

<p>“He did not make his appearance,” responded
Barthelma. “But even if that letter were the production
of some mischievous wag, or of a crazy person,
I could not possibly feel otherwise than rejoiced
at having been made the dupe of either a humourist
or a madman: for, as I just now observed, the
anonymous letter led to my meeting with you.”</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, he smoothed down her glossy,
luxuriant hair with his open palm.</p>

<p>“But doubtless your two companions found more
difficulty in consoling themselves for the disappointment?”
said Laura.</p>

<p>“Faith! dear lady,” exclaimed Lorenzo, “they
spoke but little on the subject: for, to tell you the
truth, your beauty had not failed to produce a very
sensible effect on them as well as upon myself.”</p>

<p>“Flatterer!” cried Laura, playfully caressing the
handsome Italian.</p>

<p>“Oh! you know that you are lovely&mdash;transcendently
lovely!” he exclaimed, in an ardent tone;
“and you can well believe me when I assure you
that my two friends escaped not the magic influence
of your charms. But how different were the effects
thus produced! Di Ponta&mdash;that is the name of my
fellow-countryman&mdash;was enthusiastic and rapturous
in your praise; whereas Charles Hatfield&mdash;the Englishman&mdash;became
gloomy, morose, and sullen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A singular effect for the good looks of a woman
to produce!” cried Laura, laughing&mdash;while her heart
beat with the joy of a proud triumph.</p>

<p>“Such, nevertheless, was the case in this instance,
my angel,” said Lorenzo. “I do firmly believe that
Hatfield was jealous of me in being the happy
mortal who perceived the loss of your parasol, and
had the honour of restoring it;&mdash;yes&mdash;jealous, dear
lady, because that happy accident introduced me to
your notice, and privileged me to address you.”</p>

<p>“Your English friend must be a very weak-minded
young man,” observed Laura; “and I am
truly delighted that it was <em>not</em> he whose acquaintance
I was destined to make this day.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, he is very handsome,” said Lorenzo,
gazing upon the syren with a playful affectation
of jealousy.</p>

<p>“Not so handsome as you, my Barthelma,” replied
Laura, with simulated enthusiasm; and, in
order to dispel the partial coldness which a digression
from amorous topics had allowed to creep
over her, she cast her arms around Lorenzo’s neck
and fastened her lips to his.</p>

<p>Then the blood began once more to circulate like
lightning in her veins,&mdash;and her voluptuous bosom
panted against the young Italian’s chest.</p>

<p>Here shall we leave the amorous pair; for, after
a little tender dalliance and another glass of the
exciting juice of Epernay, they retired to the chamber
whose portal we must not pass to follow
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At eight o’clock in the morning Lorenzo Barthelma
took his departure; and shortly afterwards
Rosalie entered Laura’s room.</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman, who was as discreet as she
was an adept at intrigue, wore the usual calm and
respectful expression of countenance; and not even
by a sly smile nor an arch look did she appear as if
she devoted a thought to the manner in which her
mistress had passed the night.</p>

<p>“Did the captain depart unperceived?” inquired
Laura, who, although she had given no instructions
to that effect, was nevertheless well assured that
her intelligent abigail had superintended the egress
of the handsome Italian.</p>

<p>“Entirely unobserved, <em>mademoiselle</em>,” was the
answer. “I amused the porter and his wife in
their lodge for a few minutes while Captain Barthelma
slipped out into the street. Three persons
alone are acquainted with last night’s adventure,&mdash;you,
the captain, and myself.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Laura: then, drawing aside
the curtain of the bed in which she was voluptuously
pillowed, she said, “And now, my dear
Rosalie, give me an account of your proceedings
relative to the Marquis of Delmour.”</p>

<p>“I have learnt but a few facts, <em>mademoiselle</em>,” was
the reply: “those, however, are of some importance.
He is enormously rich&mdash;very generous&mdash;bears
an excellent character&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is he married?” demanded Laura, hastily.</p>

<p>“Yes: but he has been living apart from his
wife for many years;&mdash;and respecting the cause of
their separation, there is a great mystery which
not even his best friends can penetrate, and into
which, therefore, a casual inquirer like myself could
not obtain the least insight.”</p>

<p>“And this is all you could ascertain concerning
him?” said Laura, interrogatively. “Did you not
think of asking if he had any family by his wife?”</p>

<p>“I did not forget to make that inquiry, <em>mademoiselle</em>,”
answered Rosalie; “and I was assured that
his lordship is childless.”</p>

<p>“You are a good and faithful creature,” observed
Laura; “and your services will prove invaluable to
me. That purse which lies on the toilette-table,
contains no insignificant sum in gold. It is yours&mdash;a
recompense for the work of yesterday. But as
you now know more of me than you did before, and
as in a few short hours I permitted you to obtain
a deeper reading of my secret soul than you could
possibly have acquired, had I shut myself up in a
studied reserve, it is as well that you should understand
me thoroughly. I mean this, Rosalie&mdash;that I
can be a good friend, or an implacable enemy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall never provoke your enmity, <em>mademoiselle</em>,”
observed the abigail.</p>

<p>“I do not think you will, Rosalie,” resumed
Laura: “but, as I said ere now, it is as well that you
should comprehend my character in all its details&mdash;in
all its phases. You will benefit yourself by serving
me faithfully: you would only injure yourself
by playing me false. When once I have said upon
this subject all that I mean to say, I shall not again
refer to it: but the better we understand each other,
the more permanent will be our connexion. Reckon,
then, on my friendship so long as you deserve
it;&mdash;deceive me, and I will risk my very life to be
avenged.”</p>

<p>“Oh! <em>mademoiselle</em>,” exclaimed Rosalie, absolutely
frightened by the vehemence with which her mistress
spoke,&mdash;“have I done anything to render you
suspicious of me?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said Laura, with a smile;
“you have done all you could to serve me&mdash;and you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
see that I have not forgotten to reward you. But
within the last twelve or eighteen hours I have permitted
you to read all the weaknesses of my soul&mdash;and
now it is requisite that you should understand
its strength: I have made you my confident&mdash;but I
deemed it prudent to convince you that I know how
to punish treachery. That is all, Rosalie: I have
no more to say upon the subject;&mdash;and now,
let me see your pretty face cheer up and wear a
smile.”</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman was reassured by these last
words; and, finding that her mistress had only
intended to give her a salutary warning, and not to
upbraid her for any actual misconduct, she speedily
recovered her wonted gaiety and good spirits.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXV">CHAPTER CLXV.<br />

<span class="medium">LORD WILLIAM TREVELYAN.</span></h2>

<p>The scene changes to the residence of Lord William
Trevelyan in Park Square.</p>

<p>It was evening, and the young nobleman was
pacing up and down in an elegantly furnished parlour,
which was lighted by means of a brilliant gas-jet
enclosed in a pale red glass globe&mdash;so that the
lustre which filled the room was of roseate hue.
The curtains, sofas, and cushions of the chairs were
of a rich crimson; and the paper on the walls was
of a kindred colour and splendid pattern. In each
corner of the apartment stood a marble jar, filled
with flowers recently gathered, and rendering the
atmosphere cool and fragrant.</p>

<p>Lord William was tall and handsome, his complexion
was somewhat dark, giving him the appearance
of a Spaniard rather than of an Englishman;
and yet the ruddy hues of health were upon his
cheeks. His hair was black as jet, silky as that of
a woman, and parted above a brow high, intellectual,
and expressive of a noble mind. His eyes were
large and dark, and full of the fire of genius; and
there was something peculiarly pleasing&mdash;almost
winning in his smile.</p>

<p>In disposition Lord William was amiable&mdash;in
manners unassuming: his character was unimpeachable&mdash;and
his political opinions were of the
most liberal tendency. His charity was extensive,
but entirely unostentatious: his dependants revered
him as a good master, and his acquaintances loved
him as a sincere friend.</p>

<p>He was in his twenty-fourth year; and, until he
had set eyes upon Agnes Vernon, he had never experienced
the influence of the tender passion. But
one day, while on a visit to a friend at Norwood, he
was strolling alone in the vicinity, and accident led
his footsteps towards the cottage, in the garden belonging
to which he beheld the beauteous creature
whose image had ever since filled his soul.</p>

<p>Truly had he said to Mrs. Mortimer that he adored
the fair recluse of the cottage&mdash;that he worshipped
the very ground upon which she trod: his love
amounted almost to an idolatry;&mdash;and yet he had
never exchanged a word&mdash;scarcely even a look, with
the object of his affection!</p>

<p>It could be no world-contaminated heart that entertained
such a passion as this&mdash;no selfish soul that
could cherish such a pure and holy attachment.</p>

<p>But it was a generous&mdash;upright&mdash;noble-minded
young man, who was now anxiously waiting the
arrival of the woman with whom he had made an
appointment for the evening in question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Were the English aristocracy to be judged generally
by such nobles as the Earl of Ellingham and
Lord William Trevelyan, the term of its existence
would not now perhaps be within the range of
prophecy.</p>

<p>But, as matters now stand,&mdash;as the aristocracy is
corrupt, selfish, and cruel&mdash;self-sufficient and ignorant&mdash;proud
and intolerant&mdash;unprincipled, profligate,
and tyrannical,&mdash;it is not difficult to predict its
speedy downfall.</p>

<p>Therefore is it that we boldly proclaim our conviction
that Monarchy and Aristocracy will not exist
ten years longer in enlightened England; but that a
Republic will displace them!</p>

<p>The <em>hereditary principle</em>, either in Monarchy or
Aristocracy, is the most detestable idea that ever
entered the brains of knaves, or was adopted by
fools.</p>

<p>In respect to Monarchy, we are gravely assured
that the principle of hereditary succession guarantees
a nation against the civil wars that may arise
from the pretensions of numerous claimants to the
supreme power. But the history of every monarchical
country in the world gives the lie to this assertion.
Crowns have been bones of contention from
time immemorial, and will continue to be so until
they be crushed altogether beneath the heel of Republicanism.
Take the history of England, for instance&mdash;that
England, where the hereditary principle
is said to be admirable and efficacious beyond
all question: thirty-three Kings or Queens and two
minors have reigned in this country since the Conquest
by the Norman ruffian&mdash;<em>and during that
period we have had eight civil wars and nineteen
rebellions!</em></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Laws of God</span>, moreover, bear testimony
against Monarchy. What said the Prophet Samuel
when the Jews insisted upon having a King? “I
will call unto the Lord, and he shall send thunder
and rain, that you may perceive and see that your
wickedness is great which you have done in the sight
of the Lord, <em>in asking you a King</em>. So Samuel called
unto the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain
that day; and all the people greatly feared the Lord
and Samuel. And all the people said unto Samuel,
Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that
we die not; <em>for we have added unto our sins this evil,
to ask a King</em>.”</p>

<p>Either the Bible is true or false. If true&mdash;as
assuredly it is&mdash;then is the institution of Monarchy
<em>a positive crime,</em> tolerated by an entire nation!</p>

<p>And no wonder that Heaven itself should protest
against a system which is nothing more nor less than
setting up an idol for the millions to worship,&mdash;an
idol as useless as an Indian pagod, but often as terrible
and slaughterous in its baleful influence as
Juggernaut in its fatal progress.</p>

<p>Never did Satan contrive a scheme more certain
of promoting idolatry than the raising up of Kings
and Queens as rivals to the Majesty of Heaven;&mdash;for
the root of Monarchy is in hell&mdash;the laws of God
denounce the institution as a sin&mdash;and the history
of the whole world proclaims that blood inevitably
attends upon it!</p>

<p>All men were originally equal; and in no country
therefore, could any privilege of birth give one family
a right to monopolise the executive power for ever:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
neither can one generation bind that which is as yet
to come. The existing race of human beings has no
property in the one unborn: we of the present day
have no right to assume the power of enslaving
posterity:&mdash;and, on the same principle, our ancestors
had no right to enslave us. If those ancestors
chose to make one set of laws for themselves, we
can institute another code for our own government.
But of course such a change as this can only be made
by the representatives of the People; and in order
that the people <em>may</em> have a fair representation, the
following elements of a constitution become absolutely
necessary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Universal Suffrage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vote by Ballot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Property Qualification;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paid Representatives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Annual Parliaments; and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equal Electoral Districts.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Give us these principles&mdash;accord us these institutions&mdash;and
we will vouch for the happiness, prosperity,
and tranquillity of the kingdom.</p>

<div id="i_233" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_233.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The French now stand at the head of the civilisation
of Europe. They are on the same level as
the fine people of the United States of America;
and England occupies an inferior grade in the scale.</p>

<p>Alas! that we should be compelled to speak
thus of our native land: but the truth must be
told!</p>

<p>As yet almost every country in Europe has
demanded and obtained something of its rulers,
in consequence of the French Revolution;&mdash;whereas
England has as yet obtained nothing in the shape of
Reform!</p>

<p>Oh! shame&mdash;shame! what has become of our national
spirit?&mdash;are we all willing slaves, and shall
we not agitate&mdash;morally, but energetically agitate&mdash;for
our rights and liberties?</p>

<p>The aristocracy and the men in power treat the
people’s assemblies with ridicule, and denominate
the working-classes, when so assembled, as “a
mob.” They will not discriminate between honest
politicians and the respectable working-classes on
the one hand, and the ragamuffinry of society on
the other. They confound us all together in the
sweeping appellation of “<em>the mob!</em>”</p>

<p>The insensates! Do they not reflect that if ten
or fifteen thousand persons meet for the purpose of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
discussing some grand political question, some five
or six hundred pickpockets and mischievous boys
are certain to intrude themselves into the assemblage?
Why&mdash;black sheep even find their way into
the Houses of Parliament&mdash;aye, and into the very
suite of Royalty itself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But after recording all the above observations, we
must once more declare that we do not recommend
violence: we insist upon the necessity of a grand
moral agitation&mdash;an agitation which shall pervade
the entire country, as an ocean is roused by the
storm into a mass of mighty waves. The people
must assume an imposing attitude; and let the
memorable words of Lafayette be repeated by every
tongue:&mdash;“<em>For a nation to love liberty, it is sufficient
that she knows it; and for a nation to be free, it is
sufficient that she wills it!</em>”</p>

<p>And, oh! my fellow-countrymen, let not this
glorious thesis be used in vain! By the misery and
starvation which millions of ye endure&mdash;by the
hopeless entombment to which the Poor Law
Bastilles condemn ye, when work fails&mdash;by the denial
of an honest recognition of the rights of labour,
which is insolently persisted in&mdash;by the spectacle of
your famished wives and little ones&mdash;by the naked
walls of the wretched hovels in which the labouring
population dwells&mdash;by the blinding toil of the poor
seamstress&mdash;by the insults heaped on ye by a rapacious
aristocracy and an intolerant clergy&mdash;by the
right which a despicable oligarchy usurps to hold
the reins of power&mdash;by the limited suffrage which
leaves the millions unrepresented&mdash;by the oppressive
weight of taxation laid upon the productive classes&mdash;by
the sorrows which the hard-working operative
endures throughout his virility, and the misery that
attends upon his decrepitude&mdash;by the badge of
pauperism that the sons and daughters of toil are
compelled to wear in the accursed Union-houses,&mdash;by
all your wrongs, we adjure ye not to remain at
rest&mdash;not to endure the yoke which ye can cast off
in a moment&mdash;not to stand still and gaze listlessly,
while all the rest of the civilised world is in motion!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Returning from this digression to the thread of
our narrative, we will suppose that Mrs. Mortimer
has at length arrived at the house in Park Square,
and that she is already seated with the young nobleman,
who little suspected the infamous character
of the woman whom he had admitted to his confidence.</p>

<p>“I have been looking forward with much impatience
and anxiety to your coming,” said Lord William:
“but even now that you are here, I know not
in which manner you can assist me.”</p>

<p>“<em>Faint heart never won fair lady</em>, my lord,”
returned the old woman; “and you must take
courage. The maxim which I quoted is a good
one.”</p>

<p>“I do not despair, madam,” said the young nobleman:
“and yet I seem as if I were involved in a
deep mist, through which I cannot even grope my
way. Alone and unassisted, I cannot hope to obtain
access to that charming creature; and, if assisted,
I will do nothing that shall violate the respect
due to one so pure of heart as I believe her to
be.”</p>

<p>“I should have proposed to become the bearer
of a letter from your lordship to Miss Vernon,”
remarked Mrs. Mortimer, coldly: “but, perceiving
beforehand that your scruples are over nice and
your notions somewhat of the most fastidious, I
really do not see how I can serve you.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid to write to her&mdash;she would perhaps
be offended to an extent that might be irremediable,”
exclaimed Lord William, a prey to the most cruel
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“And yet your lordship once endeavoured to bribe
the servant-girl to become the bearer of your amatory
epistle,” said Mrs. Mortimer, in a tone of sarcasm&mdash;almost
of disgust.</p>

<p>“Now you are offended with me,” cried the
young nobleman. “It is true that I did pen a letter
to Agnes&mdash;telling her how much I loved her
and how honourable were my intentions&mdash;imploring
her likewise to grant me a few moments’ interview,
and to pardon the means that I thus adopted
of accosting her, having no other mode of procuring
an introduction. Such a letter I did indeed write,”
continued Trevelyan: “but it was in a fit of despair&mdash;of
madness&mdash;of insensate recklessness.&mdash;I
know not how to explain myself! The servant
refused to deliver that note&mdash;and my eyes were
immediately opened to the impropriety of the proceeding
which I had adopted.”</p>

<p>“And you therefore decline to entrust me, who
am well acquainted with Agnes, to deliver a similar
letter into her hand? Your lordship is wrong in
thus refusing to be guided by me,” continued the
crafty old woman. “Think you that with one so
innocent, so artless as Agnes, I cannot prepare the
way to render your letter acceptable&mdash;at least to
prevent it from producing a sudden shock to her
notions of maidenly propriety?”</p>

<p>“Much as I should be rejoiced could you accomplish
that aim,” said Trevelyan, “I should be ten
thousand times happier were you able to procure
me an interview with her.”</p>

<p>“This is madness!” exclaimed the old woman.
“Can I not more easily induce her to read a letter
from a stranger, than to receive that stranger in
person? Is not the letter the first and most
natural step to the visit? Trust to me, my lord: I
know the disposition of Agnes&mdash;I understand affairs
of this nature&mdash;and I am also well aware that love
blinds you to the ways of prudence.”</p>

<p>“Be it, then, as you propose,” said Lord William,
after a long pause, during which be reflected profoundly.
“I will write the letter this evening: will
you call for it early to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered the old woman: “and in
less than twenty-four hours I will undertake to
bring you tidings calculated to encourage hope&mdash;or
I am very much mistaken,” she added emphatically.</p>

<p>“You do not believe&mdash;you have no reason to
suppose that the father of Agnes already destines
her to become the bride of some person of his own
choice?” asked Trevelyan, now for the first time
shaping in words an idea that had haunted him for
some days past. “Because,” he continued, speaking
with the rapidity of excitement, “I cannot possibly
comprehend wherefore he compels her to dwell
in that strict seclusion.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe that you have any such cause
for apprehension,” said Mrs. Mortimer, in a tone of
confidence&mdash;as if she were well able to give the
species of assurance which she so emphatically conveyed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
“There is a mystery&mdash;a deep mystery attached
to the fair recluse,&mdash;and what that mystery
is, I am myself completely ignorant. But that the
father of Agnes has no such intention as the one
you imagined, and that Agnes herself has as yet
never known the passion of love,&mdash;these are facts
to which I do not hesitate to pledge myself most
solemnly.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then there is indeed room for hope!” exclaimed
Lord William, his countenance brightening
up and joy flashing in his eyes.</p>

<p>“A nobleman in your position&mdash;blessed with
wealth and a handsome person&mdash;endowed with
agreeable manners and a cultivated mind,” said
Mrs. Mortimer, “need not despair of winning the
love and securing the hand of a maiden dwelling in
utter obscurity and totally unacquainted with the
world.”</p>

<p>“I would rather that she should learn to love me
for my own sake, madam,” observed Lord William,
in a serious tone, “than for any adventitious advantages
of rank or social position that I may
possess.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lord&mdash;we shall see,” said Mrs. Mortimer,
rising to depart. “To-morrow morning I will
call for the letter; and I shall proceed straight over
to the cottage: In the afternoon, or evening, I will
do myself the honour of waiting upon your lordship
again.”</p>

<p>“I shall expect you with impatience, madam,”
returned Trevelyan, as he politely hastened to open
the door for her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer took her leave; and the young
nobleman sate down to pen a letter to Agnes
Vernon.</p>

<p>But this was not so easy a matter as he had anticipated.
Sheet after sheet of paper did he spoil,&mdash;a
hundred times did he commence&mdash;and as often did
he throw aside his pen in despair. Now he fancied
that his style was too bold&mdash;then he conceived it to
be too tame and vague: now he imagined himself to
be too complimentary in his language towards one
possessing a mind so chaste and pure&mdash;then he felt
assured that he was acting indiscreetly to write at
all. In the course of an hour he was swayed by
such an infinite variety of conflicting sentiments and
impressions that he was almost inclined to throw
up the task in despair.</p>

<p>At length, however, he made a beginning which
pleased him; and his pen then ran fluently enough
over the paper, until the letter was composed in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Pardon a stranger who dares to address you, beautiful
Miss Vernon, in a strain that might give you offence, were he
not sincere in his language and honourable in his intentions:&mdash;pardon
me, I implore you&mdash;and refuse not to read these few
lines to the end! He who thus writes is the individual that
you have observed occasionally in the vicinity of your dwelling;
and you will perceive by the signature to this letter
that he is not a man without ostensible guarantees for his
social position. That his character is unimpeachable he can
proudly declare; and that he will not address to you, Miss
Vernon, a single word which he will fear to repeat in your
father’s presence, he solemnly declares.</p>

<p>“Let me, however, speak of myself in the first person
again: let me assure you that your beauty has captivated my
heart&mdash;and that, if anything were wanting to render me your
slave, the description which the bearer of this letter has given
me of your amiable qualities, would be more than sufficient.
I am rich&mdash;and therefore I have no selfish motive in addressing
you, even if you be rich also: but I would rather
that it were otherwise with you, so that my present proceeding
may appear to you the more disinterested. Had I any
means of obtaining an introduction to you, beautiful Miss
Vernon, I should not have adopted a measure that gives me
pain because I tremble lest it should wound or offend you.
But mine is an honest&mdash;a sincere&mdash;and a devoted attachment;
and I shall be happy indeed if you will permit me to open a
correspondence with your father on the subject. Were he to
honour me with a visit, I should be proud to receive him.
But if, in the meantime, you seek to know more of me&mdash;if I
might venture to solicit you to accord me an interview of
only a few minutes, you cannot divine how fervently I should
thank you&mdash;how delighted I should feel! Let this interview
take place in the presence of Mrs. Mortimer, if you will: I
have nothing to communicate to you that I should hesitate
to say before your father or your friends. Oh! how can I
convince you of my sincerity?&mdash;how can I testify my devotion?&mdash;how
can I prove the extent of my love?</p>

<p>“I beseech you to reflect, Miss Vernon, that my happiness
depends upon your reply. Am I guilty of an indiscretion in
loving you? Love is a passion beyond mortal control!
He who knows no other deity, deserves not blame for worshipping
the sun, because it is glorious and bright; and my
heart, which knows no other idol, adores you, because you
are beautiful and good. Treat not my conduct, then, with
anger: let not your pride be offended by the proceeding
which I have adopted in order to make my sentiments
known to you;&mdash;and scorn not the honest&mdash;the pure&mdash;the
ardent affection which an honourable man dares to proffer
you. I do not merit punishment because I love you;&mdash;and
your silence would prove a punishment severe and undeserved
indeed! Again, I conjure you to remember that the
happiness of a fellow-creature depends upon you: your decision
will either inspire me with the most joyous hope, or
plunge me into the deepest despair. At the same time,
beauteous Agnes,&mdash;(the words&mdash;those delightful words,
’beauteous Agnes,’ are written now, and I cannot&mdash;will not
erase them)&mdash;at the same time, I say, if your affections be
already engaged&mdash;if a mortal more blest than myself have
received the promise of your hand,&mdash;accept the assurance,
sweet maiden, that never more shall you be molested by me&mdash;never
again will I intrude myself upon your attention.
For with my love is united the most profound respect; and
not for worlds would I do aught to excite an angry feeling
in your soul.</p>

“Your ardent admirer and devoted friend,<br />
“WILLIAM TREVELYAN.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>With this letter the young nobleman was satisfied.
He considered it to be sufficiently energetic,
and at the same time respectful: he saw nothing in
it against which the purest mind could take exceptions;
and, in the sanguine confidence natural to his
age, and to the honourable candour of his disposition,
he already looked upon his aims as half accomplished&mdash;his
aspirations as half gained.</p>

<p>Having sealed and addressed the letter, he placed
it upon the mantel-piece ready for Mrs. Mortimer
when she should call in the morning: then, fetching
a portfolio from an inner room, he opened it, and
from amongst several drawings in water-colours,
selected one on which his gaze was immediately
rivetted with deep and absorbing interest.</p>

<p>For that painting&mdash;executed by his own hand&mdash;was
a portrait of Agnes Vernon; and even the most
fastidious critic, if acquainted with the original,
must have pronounced it to be a living likeness.</p>

<p>Yes: on that paper was delineated, with the most
perfect accuracy, the fair countenance of the <em>Recluse
of the Cottage</em>,&mdash;every feature&mdash;every lineament
drawn with a fidelity to which only a first-rate
artist, or an amateur whose pencil was guided by
the finger of Love, could have possibly attained.
There were the eyes of deep blackness and melting
softness,&mdash;there was the high, intelligent forehead,&mdash;there
was the raven hair, silken and glossy, and
seeming to flow luxuriantly even in the very picture,&mdash;and
there was the rich red mouth, wearing a smile
such as mortals behold upon the lips of angels in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
their dreams. How charming was the entire countenance!&mdash;how
amiable&mdash;how heavenly the expression
that it wore!</p>

<p>And no wonder that the likeness was so striking&mdash;so
accurate&mdash;so faithful;&mdash;for the young nobleman
had touched and retouched it until he had delineated
on the paper the precise counterpart of the image
that dwelt in his mind. Hours and hours had he
devoted to that labour of love:&mdash;on each occasion
when he returned home after contemplating, from
behind the green barrier of the garden, the idol of
his adoration, he addressed himself to the improvement
of that portrait. At one time he had beheld the
maiden to greater advantage than at another; and
then he studied to convey to the card-board the last
and most pleasing impression thus made upon his
mind; until he produced a likeness so faithful that
not another touch was required&mdash;no further improvement
could be effected.</p>

<p>And, like Pygmalion with his Galatea, how Lord
William Trevelyan worshipped that portrait! No&mdash;the
simile is incorrect; because the sculptor learnt
to adore the statue that was cold and passionless&mdash;whereas
the young nobleman was blest with the
conviction that there was a living original for the
image he had so faithfully traced upon his paper,&mdash;and
it was that living original whom he made the
goddess of his thoughts.</p>

<p>The clock had struck ten, and Lord William was
still bending over the portrait that lay upon the table,
when a footman entered the room to announce that
a lady who declined to give her name solicited an
interview with the young nobleman.</p>

<p>Lord William, hastily closing the portfolio, desired
that she might be immediately shown into his
presence.</p>

<p>The domestic bowed and retired.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he returned, ushering in the
unknown visitor, who wore a veil over her countenance:
but the moment the footman had withdrawn,
she raised the veil, and disclosed a face that was strikingly
handsome, though pale and careworn. She was
apparently about thirty-six or thirty-seven years of
age&mdash;with dark hair, fine hazel eyes, and good teeth.
Tall and well-formed, her figure, which was rather
inclined to <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</em>, was set off to advantage by
the tasteful&mdash;indeed elegant style of her dress; and
in her deportment there was an air of distinction
denoting the polished and well-bred lady.</p>

<p>Lord William received her with becoming courtesy,
requested her to be seated, and then awaited
an explanation of her business.</p>

<p>“Your lordship is doubtless surprised at receiving
a visit at so unseasonable an hour, and on the
part of a complete stranger,” began the lady, in a
pleasing though mournful tone of voice: “but I
know not to whom else to address myself for the
information I now seek&mdash;and if you cannot afford
it to me, I shall be unhappy indeed.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Lord William, somewhat astonished
at this mysterious opening of the conversation,
“if it be in my power to serve you, I shall render
that service cheerfully.”</p>

<p>“You are well acquainted, I believe, my lord,
with Sir Gilbert Heathcote?” observed the lady,
somewhat abruptly, as she bowed her thanks for
the assurance the young nobleman had given her.</p>

<p>“Sir Gilbert Heathcote, though much older than
I, is an intimate friend of mine,” observed Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“Do you know where he is&mdash;what has become
of him?” demanded the lady, in a still more anxious
tone than before.</p>

<p>“I really do not, madam,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Merciful heavens!” she exclaimed, clasping her
hands together in a paroxysm of sorrow.</p>

<p>“I have not seen him for this week past,” continued
Trevelyan. “But&mdash;are you ill, madam?
Can I offer you anything?&mdash;shall I summon assistance?”</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, the nobleman rose from his
seat and approached the bell-pull.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, my lord!” cried the lady. “Do not
ring&mdash;do not call your servants! I shall be better
presently. But pardon me if I could not control
my feelings,” she added, wiping the tears from her
eyes.</p>

<p>The young nobleman, in spite of the adjuration
to the contrary, hastened into the adjoining room
and speedily returned with a decanter of spring
water and a tumbler. He then filled the glass and
presented it to his afflicted visitor, who thanked
him for his delicate attention with a look expressive
of gratitude&mdash;the words that she would have
uttered being stifled in her throat.</p>

<p>Refreshed with the cooling beverage, she said,
after a short pause, “My lord, have you the slightest
conception where your friend Sir Gilbert Heathcote
is? Did he intimate to you his intention to leave
London? did he hint at the probability of his departure
from England? Oh! I conjure you to tell
me all you know: for&mdash;for&mdash;you cannot divine how
much&mdash;how deeply I love him!”</p>

<p>Trevelyan was struck with astonishment at these
last words,&mdash;words that were uttered in a tone of
such convincing, such profound sincerity, that he
could not for an instant question their import. And
yet&mdash;though since the days of childhood Trevelyan
had known Sir Gilbert Heathcote&mdash;he had never
heard that the baronet was married: on the contrary,
he had invariably understood him to be a
single man. If this latter belief were the true one,
then, was the lady now in his presence the mistress
of his friend?&mdash;for assuredly she had not spoken
with the confidence of a sister, but with the hesitation
of one who reveals a fact that is in some way
associated with shame.</p>

<p>The lady perceived what was passing in the mind
of Trevelyan; and in a low but fully audible tone,
she said, “My lord, circumstances compel me to
reveal myself to you as your friend’s mistress. Yes:
though I love him more than ever wife could love&mdash;yet
am I only his mistress,&mdash;for, alas! I am the wife
of another! And now, my lord,” she added, with
deep feeling, “you may spurn me from you&mdash;you
may command your lacquey to thrust me from your
dwelling: but I implore you to give me tidings of
Sir Gilbert!”</p>

<p>“Madam,” exclaimed Trevelyan, the moment
he could recover from the bewilderment into which
this impassioned address plunged him, “not for
worlds could I do or say aught to augment year
affliction&mdash;much less to insult you. I declare to
you most solemnly that I have neither heard nor
seen anything of Sir Gilbert Heathcote for a week.
I called at his chambers in the Albany the day
before yesterday, and was simply informed that he
was not at home. I left my card without thinking
to make further inquiries&mdash;not suspecting that his
absence had been for days, instead of hours.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;upwards of a week has elapsed since
I saw him,” exclaimed the lady, with difficulty subduing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
a fresh outburst of grief. “Each day have I
been to the Albany&mdash;and still the answer is the
same&mdash;‘<em>He has not returned!</em>’ No&mdash;he has not
returned,” she added, clasping her hands together;
“and he has not written to me! O God! I fear
that some fatal accident has befallen him!”</p>

<p>“Do not give way to such a distressing belief,”
cried Trevelyan, feeling deeply for the unfortunate
woman, whose grief was so profound and so sincere.
“Shall I make inquiries&mdash;immediate inquiries&mdash;concerning
him? Perhaps I may learn more than
a lady possibly can.”</p>

<p>“Generous-hearted nobleman!” exclaimed the
visitor; “how can I ever repay you for this kindness
towards an utter stranger?”</p>

<p>“Remember also, madam,” said Trevelyan, “that,
apart from my readiness to serve you or any lady
whom affliction has overtaken, I begin to experience
some degree of anxiety on behalf of a gentleman
who has ever shown a sincere friendship towards
me. Not another minute will I delay the inquiries
which, alike for your sake and his, I now deem it
necessary to institute.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the young nobleman rose from
his chair.</p>

<p>“My lord,” said the lady, rising also, and speaking
in a tone indicative of deep emotion, “may I
hope to receive a communication from you as early
as possible? My suspense will be great&mdash;it is even
now intolerable&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And she burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Madam,” interrupted the young nobleman,
profoundly touched by her affliction, which was
evidently most unfeigned, “you can either accompany
me, or remain here until my return. Perhaps
the latter will be the more desirable&mdash;at least if
you can restrain your impatience, so natural under
the circumstances, for a couple of hours. But
perhaps,” he added, an idea striking him,&mdash;“perhaps
you live at some distance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am the occupant of a house in Kentish Town,”
said the lady; “and therefore my dwelling is not very
far from your lordship’s. If you see no impropriety
in it&mdash;if there be no one here whom my presence
would offend,” she continued, speaking in a subdued
and almost timid tone, “I would rather&mdash;oh! much
rather wait until you return.”</p>

<p>“By all means, madam,” exclaimed the generous-hearted
young noble. “Should you require anything
during my absence, the servants will obey
your summons; and they will receive my orders,
ere I depart, to pay you every attention.”</p>

<p>“I shall not trouble them, my lord,” was the
reply: “but I return you my deepest&mdash;sincerest
thanks for the kind consideration with which you
treat me.”</p>

<p>Trevelyan bowed, and then quitted the room.</p>

<span class="medium">A SKETCH OF TWO BROTHERS.&mdash;A MYSTERY.</span></h2>

<p>The nobleman’s cab was got ready in a very few
minutes; and while he is driving rapidly along towards
Piccadilly, we will place on record some particulars
respecting Sir Gilbert Heathcote.</p>

<p>The baronet was a man of about forty years of
age, and of very handsome countenance, as well as
of tall, commanding figure. He had never married;
and report stated that a disappointment in love, experienced
when he was very young, had induced him
to make a vow to the effect that, as he had lost the
idol of his heart’s devotion, he would never accompany
another to the altar. Such was the rumour
which had obtained currency at the time amongst
his friends, and was even repeated at the period
whereof we are writing, whenever astonishment
was expressed that a man enjoying all the advantages
of personal appearance and social position
should not have sought to form a brilliant matrimonial
alliance. For the baronet was not only very
handsome, as remarked above, but he also possessed
the superior attraction of four thousand a year.
His habits were nevertheless inexpensive: he lived
in chambers at the Albany, and had no country
seat. Indeed, he seldom quitted London, and was
altogether of quiet&mdash;even retired habits. He was
fond of reading, and was also an admirer of the fine
arts: he used often to observe that the only extravagance
of which he was ever guilty, consisted in the
purchase of a fine picture or of articles of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">virt&ucirc;</em>;&mdash;but
these he seldom retained&mdash;giving them as presents
to his friends or to museums. Not that he
was whimsical or capricious, and grew tired to-day
of what he had bought yesterday: but he was pleased
at the thought of rescuing good paintings and real
curiosities from the auction-room or from Wardour-street;
and he was wont to observe that he experienced
more delight in seeing them in the possession
of friends who could appreciate their value, or
in museums where their safety was ensured, than in
having them left to the mercy of servants in his
“bachelor apartments.” The fact was, that his disposition
was naturally generous; but this generosity
was displayed in a particular fashion&mdash;and as
he himself admired objects of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">virt&ucirc;</em>, he fancied that
they must likewise prove the most welcome gifts he
could bestow upon his friends.</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert had a brother, who was very unlike
himself. James Heathcote was an attorney&mdash;grasping,
greedy, avaricious, unprincipled&mdash;and therefore
rich. He was only two years younger than Sir Gilbert;
but close application to business, evil passions,
and parsimonious habits had exercised such
an influence upon his personal appearance, that he
seemed ten years older. His hair was grey&mdash;that
of Sir Gilbert was quite dark: his form was slightly
bowed&mdash;that of the baronet was erect as a dart.
James also was unmarried&mdash;but not through any
disappointment in early life. Indeed, he possessed
a heart that might be susceptible of desire, but
could not possibly experience the pure feeling of
love. He lived in a handsome house in Bedford-row,
Holborn; and his apartments were elegantly
furnished;&mdash;for he was wont to observe that persons
who are anxious to get on in this world, must
make a good appearance, and that a mean office
frequently turns away a person who might prove
an excellent client. But his aim was to amass
money&mdash;his object was to increase his wealth, no
matter how: still he had always contrived matters
so cunningly, that no one could positively and unequivocally
prove him to be a rogue.</p>

<p>With such a dissimilitude of character between
the two brothers, it cannot be supposed that any
extraordinary degree of intimacy existed on their
part. Indeed, they seldom saw each other&mdash;although
the more generous nature of Gilbert would have
cheerfully maintained a more consistent and becoming
feeling: but the cold, reserved, matter-of-fact
disposition of James proved absolutely repulsive
and forbidding in this respect. So great, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
fine, was the discrepancy between these men, that
people were surprised when they learnt for the first
time that the money-making, hard-hearted attorney
was the brother of the urbane, amiable, and polished
baronet.</p>

<p>These hasty outlines will afford the reader some
idea of Sir Gilbert Heathcote on the one hand, and
Mr. James Heathcote on the other. We shall see
more of them both hereafter; and their characters
will then become more fully developed. In the
meantime we must return to Lord William Trevelyan,
whom we left hastening in his cab, at half-past
ten at night, towards the Albany.</p>

<p>On arriving at that celebrated establishment, the
young nobleman instituted various inquiries concerning
Sir Gilbert; but not the least particle of
information of a satisfactory nature could he obtain.
It appeared that the baronet had been absent for
eight days, and that no communication had been
received from him&mdash;neither had he given any previous
intimation of his intended departure. His
brother had been informed of this unaccountable
absence; but it seemed that the attorney had taken
no step to solve the mystery. This was the only
fact which Lord William succeeded in gleaning in
addition to the meagre knowledge he already possessed
relative to the matter; and he returned
homeward with a heavy heart, and experiencing
strange misgivings in respect to his friend.</p>

<p>It was near midnight when he re-entered the
room where he had left the lady. The moment he
appeared on the threshold of the door, she rose from
her seat and hastened forward to meet him, her
looks revealing the intensity of the anxiety and the
acuteness of the suspense which she experienced.
But when she saw by his countenance, even before
a word fell from his lips, that he had no good news
to impart, a ghastly pallor overspread her face, and
she would have fallen had he not supported her and
led her back to her chair.</p>

<p>“I grieve to say, madam,” he at length observed,
“that I have learnt nothing more than what you
already know&mdash;unless indeed it be the fact that a
communication respecting Sir Gilbert’s disappearance
has been made to Mr. James Heathcote, and
that he has treated the matter with unpardonable
levity&mdash;if not with heartless indifference.”</p>

<p>“I do not know that brother&mdash;I never saw him,”
said the lady, speaking in a broken voice: “but I
have heard enough of his character to make me
dread him.”</p>

<p>“At the same time, madam,” remarked Lord
Trevelyan, in a tone of firm though gentle remonstrance,
“there is not the slightest ground for suspicion
against Mr. James Heathcote; and such an
observation as that which a moment ago fell from
your lips, might act most seriously to the prejudice
of an innocent man. I likewise am unacquainted
with Mr. Heathcote, otherwise than by name&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And your lordship is well aware that his reputation
is not the most enviable in the world!” exclaimed
the lady in an impassioned tone.”</p>

<p>“I have never heard any definite charges against
him, madam,” said Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not positive charges which may fix him
with the perpetration of a special and particular
deed of guilt,” she cried, as if determined to level
her suspicions against the attorney: “but your
lordship has doubtless heard a thousand vague accusations&mdash;usury&mdash;extortion&mdash;grinding
down the
poor to the very dust&mdash;hurrying on law proceedings
with merciless haste&mdash;unrelentingly sweeping
away the property of his victims&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All these charges I have certainly heard, madam,”
said Trevelyan; “but I will not admit that
they warrant the darkest, blackest suspicion which
one human being can possibly entertain towards
another. Understand me, madam&mdash;I have no motive
in defending James Heathcote, beyond the
true English principle of never judging a person
through the medium of prejudices. For your satisfaction
I will call upon Mr. Heathcote to-morrow&mdash;I
will speak to him relative to the mysterious disappearance
of his brother&mdash;I will hear his replies&mdash;I
will even watch his countenance and observe his
manner as he speaks. And believe me, madam,”
proceeded the young nobleman, emphatically,&mdash;“believe
me when I assure you that if there should
transpire the least cause of suspicion&mdash;if there
should appear aught to warrant the belief that
James Heathcote could have possibly practised or
instigated foul play in respect to his brother,&mdash;believe
me, madam, I repeat, that I will pursue
the investigation&mdash;I will leave no stone unturned&mdash;I
will prosecute my inquiries until I shall have
brought home that deep guilt to his door. But
not for an instant&mdash;no, not for a single moment
can I believe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Act as you have said, my lord&mdash;and, depend
upon it, you will find in the sequel that my opinions
are not so unjust&mdash;so uncalled for&mdash;so reprehensible,
as you now conceive them to be. But, oh!” exclaimed
the lady, clasping her hands wildly together,&mdash;“it
is terrible&mdash;terrible even for a moment to
entertain the idea that he whom I love so devotedly
may be no more!”</p>

<p>“Compose yourself, madam&mdash;tranquillise your
feelings, I implore you!” cried Lord William Trevelyan.
“We must not give way to despair&mdash;we
must not harbour the dreadful thought that Sir
Gilbert Heathcote has met with foul play, and that
he ceases to exist. No&mdash;no: let us hope&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! my lord, how can we hope in the face of
such strange&mdash;such mysterious&mdash;such suspicious
circumstances?” demanded the lady, with mingled
grief and bitterness. “Even if he did not choose to
acquaint his friends with his intended absence and
its motives, he would not be equally reserved towards
me. No&mdash;he would have seen me ere his
departure&mdash;or he would at least have written. For
you must now learn, my lord, that we have loved
each other for upwards of twenty years,” she continued,
in a low and plaintive tone. “For twenty
years and more have our hearts beat in unison;&mdash;and
never&mdash;never was love so devoted as ours!
Alas! mine has been a strange and romantic life;
and the influence that has swayed all its incidents
was that passion which the worldly-minded treat
so lightly. For my father was a worldly-minded
man; and, though he knew how fondly I loved and
how ardently I was beloved,&mdash;though I knelt before
him and conjured him by all he held most sacred,
and by the spirit of my mother who died in my
childhood, not to sacrifice me to the object of <em>his</em>
choice, and tear me away from the object of <em>mine</em>,&mdash;nevertheless,
he ridiculed my prayers&mdash;he made
naught of my beseechings&mdash;and I was immolated
upon the altar of a parent’s sordid interest. Your
lordship has perhaps already understood that the <em>one</em>
whom I adored was Gilbert Heathcote. Never&mdash;never
was love’s tale told with more enchanting
sweetness than by his lips: never&mdash;never did woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
cherish more devotedly than I that avowal of a
sincere passion! At that time his personal beauty
was sufficient to ensnare the heart of any maiden,
though far less susceptible than mine;&mdash;and I loved
him&mdash;loved him madly. But a wealthy noble had
seen me; and my father beheld with joy the impression
that I had been so unfortunate as to make
upon that patrician’s fancy. Moreover, at that
period, my sire was suffering cruel pecuniary embarrassments;
and the brilliant marriage which he
hoped to accomplish for his daughter, appeared the
only means of extricating himself from his difficulties.
Thus the suit of the nobleman was encouraged
by my father&mdash;and I was induced by the menaces,
the prayers, and the specious reasoning which he
employed by turns to move me,&mdash;I was induced, I
say, to tolerate the visits of the peer, although
heaven knows I never could encourage them. Not
that his personal appearance was disagreeable&mdash;nor
that I paused to reflect that his age was more than
double my own: no&mdash;for he was handsome&mdash;very
handsome; and, though his years were twice mine,
yet he was but in the prime of life. Wherefore,
then, did I receive his addresses with loathing?&mdash;wherefore
did I implore my father to save me from
an alliance which was so desirable and so brilliant in
every worldly point of view? Oh! it was because
my heart was irrevocably given to another&mdash;because
Gilbert Heathcote possessed all my love!”</p>

<p>The lady paused, and wiped away the tears which
so many varied reminiscences had wrung from her
eyes,&mdash;while profound sobs convulsed her bosom.</p>

<p>Lord William Trevelyan felt the embarrassment
and awkwardness of his position; for it was now
past midnight&mdash;and he began to reflect that his
servants might look suspiciously upon the fact of
this protracted visit on the part of a lady who
was still young enough, and certainly handsome
enough to afford food for scandalous tongues.
Not that Lord William was either a rigid saint or
a stern anchorite in respect to the female sex: but,
although unmarried, he behaved with the utmost
circumspection, and would never have outraged
decency so far as to make his own abode the place
of an intrigue or gallant <em>rendezvous</em>. Moreover,
the love which he entertained for Agnes Vernon
had exercised such a purifying&mdash;such a chastening
influence upon his soul, that he shrank from the
idea of compromising himself by any real impropriety,
or of becoming compromised by means of
any indiscretion which scandal might think fit to
attribute to him.</p>

<p>The lady was however too much absorbed in her
own thoughts and emotions to mark how rapidly
time was slipping away, or to reflect upon the imprudence
of prolonging her visit. Her feelings were
painfully excited, not only by the fears which she
entertained on account of the absence of Sir
Gilbert Heathcote&mdash;but likewise by the reminiscences
which had been stirred up in her soul, and the outpouring
of which to sympathetic ears seemed a
necessary vent for a bosom so full of sorrow.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” she resumed, after a short pause,
her voice still being characterised by a tone of the
most touching melancholy; “my father forced me
into that hated marriage&mdash;and though I gained
rank and a proud position, yet hope and happiness
appeared to have forsaken me for ever. But I
cannot tell you all,” she exclaimed, hastily, as if a
sudden thought had struck her, warning her that
she was about to be led by her feelings into revelations
of a nature which she would repent, or which
would at least be unbecoming and injudicious.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Lord William, emphatically,&mdash;“I
do not seek your confidence&mdash;I do not even desire
it: but you have to do with a man of honour, by
whom everything you may impart, whether with
premeditation or unguardedly, will be held as
sacred.”</p>

<p>“I thank your lordship for this kind assurance,”
observed the lady. “Do not imagine that I wish to
force you into becoming the depositary of my secrets,
in order to establish a species of claim upon your
friendship. No&mdash;my lord: I am not selfish&mdash;neither
am I an intriguer,&mdash;only a most unhappy&mdash;a most
unfortunate woman! But it is because you have
manifested some little interest in me&mdash;because you
have so generously promised to aid me in clearing
up the mystery which surrounds the sudden disappearance
of one so dear to me,&mdash;it is for these
reasons, my lord, that I am anxious to explain so
much of the circumstances of my connexion with
<em>him</em>, as will convince you that nothing but the sincerest
affection on my part could have placed me
in a position which the world generally would
regard with scorn. I have told your lordship how,
loving Gilbert Heathcote, I was forced into a most
inauspicious marriage with another: but the name
of <em>that other</em> I need not mention. My father saw,
when it was too late, that he had indeed sacrificed
my happiness on the altar of his own selfishness;
and he died of remorse&mdash;of a broken heart! My
husband&mdash;my noble husband&mdash;was kind and generous
towards me: but I could not love him&mdash;and
he knew it. Then he grew jealous&mdash;and other circumstances,”
she added, casting down her eyes and
blushing deeply, “embittered our lives. At length&mdash;or,
I should rather say, at the expiration of a few
short years, I fled from him&mdash;fled from the husband
who had been forced upon me&mdash;and sought refuge
with the object of my heart’s sole and undivided
affection. From that moment I have dwelt under
the protection of Sir Gilbert Heathcote,&mdash;dwelt in
the strictest privacy&mdash;happy in the possession of his
love&mdash;a love which, as well as my own, has known
no diminution with the lapse of years. To one of
your generous soul&mdash;of your enlightened mind, my
position may not appear so degrading&mdash;so humiliating,
as it would to one incapable of distinguishing
between the heart’s irresistible affection and a
mere sensual depravity. Pardon me, my lord, for
having thus obtruded this slight, and, I fear, rambling
sketch, upon your notice: but I could not endure
the conviction that I must appear in your eyes
to be nothing more nor less than the pensioned mistress
of your friend. The length of time that <em>his</em>
love for me has endured, may be alone sufficient to
persuade you that I am not to be confounded amidst
the common mass of female degradation and immorality.”</p>

<p>“Madam, I thank you for this explanation&mdash;and
I comprehend all the delicacy and peculiarity of
your position,” said Lord William Trevelyan, rising
from his seat, the lady herself having set the
example&mdash;for it now struck her that she had remained
until a very late hour.</p>

<p>“You will pardon me, my lord,” she said, “for
having thus occupied so much of your time. But
I know you to be one of Sir Gilbert’s best friends&mdash;indeed,
the one of whom he was principally accustomed
to speak, and whom he loved and relied
upon the most. May I hope that you will favour me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
with a communication, so soon as you shall have seen
Mr. James Heathcote? Although, in virtue of my
marriage, I bear a proud and a great name, yet for
years and years have I been known only as Mrs.
Sefton&mdash;and by that appellation must I be known
to you.”</p>

<p>The lady then mentioned her address in Kentish
Town; and, extending her hand to the young
nobleman, renewed her thanks for the kindness
which he had shown her.</p>

<p>He offered to escort her to her home: but this
she declined with a firmness, at the same time in
such delicate terms, as to convince him that she
would neither compromise herself, nor allow him
to be compromised by a courtesy which he could
not well have refrained from proposing, although
he might not have been well pleased to carry it into
effect.</p>

<p>He promised to call upon her as soon as he had
anything important to communicate; and Mrs.
Sefton then took her departure, Trevelyan ringing
the bell in order that the servant might attend her
to the door, so that there should be nothing clandestine
nor stealthy in the appearance of the visit.</p>

<p>When Trevelyan was once more alone, he threw
himself in an arm-chair, and gave way to his reflections&mdash;for
the evening’s adventure had, in all its
details, furnished ample food for thought. In the
first place, there was the strange&mdash;the unaccountable
disappearance of Sir Gilbert Heathcote&mdash;a man to
whom the young patrician was much attached, and
whose friendship he valued highly. Then, in spite
of the remonstrances which he had addressed to
Mrs. Sefton, he found suspicions existing in his
mind relative to James Heathcote&mdash;suspicions of a
nature which he dared not attempt to define even
in the secresy of his own soul; but which nevertheless
every moment grew stronger, vague though
they were. Next, he pondered upon the particulars
of the slight autobiographical sketch the lady
had given him; and he dwelt with a yet unsubdued
surprise on the fact that his friend Sir Gilbert
had maintained, for so long a time and entirely unsuspected,
a connexion that fully accounted for
his bachelor-life. Lastly, Trevelyan meditated
upon the course which he must adopt to discover
the baronet’s fate, unless he should speedily re-appear
and relieve from their cruel suspense and uncertainty
those who were interested in him.</p>

<p>The young nobleman felt not the slightest inclination
to retire to rest, although it was now one
o’clock in the morning. The adventures of the
evening had excited and unsettled him;&mdash;but having
pondered on the various topics above enumerated,
his thoughts insensibly reverted to his beloved
Agnes.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes caught the portfolio that he
had left upon the table; and, opening it, he took
forth the portrait of the Recluse of the Cottage.
But, ah! why did he start?&mdash;what did he see?</p>

<p>Rising from his chair, he held the picture in such
a manner that the light gave him a perfect view of
it: and, sure enough&mdash;beyond all possibility of mistake&mdash;there
was a mark upon the dress,&mdash;a spot,
as if a drop of water&mdash;perhaps a tear&mdash;had fallen
upon it.</p>

<p>What could this mean?&mdash;how could such an accident
have happened?</p>

<p>Again and again he looked,&mdash;looked steadfastly&mdash;earnestly;
and the longer he gazed, the more convinced
did he become that his eyes did not deceive
him&mdash;that he saw aright&mdash;and that the stain or
the spot was there!</p>

<p>Yet he had not noticed it when, after Mrs. Mortimer’s
departure, and previous to Mrs. Sefton’s
arrival, he had so long and so ardently contemplated
that portrait. No: the mark was not there
<em>then</em>; or else he&mdash;the lover, devouring the entire
portrait,&mdash;he, the artist, scrutinising with satisfaction
every minute detail of his own drawing,&mdash;oh!
yes&mdash;he could not have failed to observe the slightest
speck&mdash;the least, least spot that marred the general
effect of that pleasing delineation!</p>

<p>Was it possible, then, that Mrs. Sefton had inspected
the portfolio? Yes&mdash;such a supposition
was natural enough. She was left alone in that
room for nearly two hours; and, in spite of her
sorrow, the time must have seemed so irksome to
her as to induce her to have recourse to any means
to while it away, if not to divert her thoughts into
a less melancholy channel.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;yes: he had divined the truth now, no
doubt! At least such was his idea;&mdash;and then the
tear&mdash;oh! It was easily accounted for. She was
overwhelmed with grief at the mysterious and
alarming absence of the man whom she loved; and
she was weeping while she turned over the contents
of the portfolio.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;it is no matter,” thought Trevelyan, as he
arrived at these conclusions: “It would have been
far worse had the tear fallen on the face of the portrait,&mdash;for
I might labour for hours&mdash;nay, for days,
without being enabled to catch and delineate so
faithfully again that sweet expression of countenance
which Agnes wears, and which I have succeeded
in conveying to my paper. But the mark is
upon the dress&mdash;and a single touch with the brush
will repair the injury. Alas! poor woman,” he
added, in his musings, and alluding to Mrs. Sefton,
“you have indeed enough to weep for, if you have
lost all you love on earth&mdash;and, even had you spoilt
the portrait altogether, I would have forgiven
you!”</p>

<p>Trevelyan now returned the drawing to the portfolio,
which he conveyed to the little room adjoining;
and then, retracing his way into the parlour,
he approached the mantel-piece to take the
letter which he had written to Agnes.</p>

<p>But he was astounded&mdash;stupified by the conviction
which burst upon him that the letter was
gone!</p>

<p>Gone!&mdash;it might have dropped upon the floor&mdash;on
the rug&mdash;in the fender? No:&mdash;vainly did he
search&mdash;uselessly did he pry into every nook and
corner he could think of;&mdash;the letter had disappeared!</p>

<p>He rang the bell furiously.</p>

<p>“Did any one enter this room during my absence
just now, and while that lady was here?” he demanded
of the domestic, who responded to the
summons.</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“You are certain?” said Trevelyan, with interrogative
emphasis.</p>

<p>“I am positive, my lord,” replied the man; then,
after a pause, he observed, “I hope nothing unpleasant
has occurred, my lord?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no&mdash;you may retire,” said the nobleman,
abstractedly; and, when the domestic had left the
room, he threw himself into a chair, overcome with
amazement and grief at the mysterious circumstance
that had occurred.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<div id="i_241" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Could Mrs. Sefton have taken the letter? No:
the idea was ridiculous. She was too much absorbed
in her own sorrows to have leisure for the
gratification of an idle and impertinent curiosity.
Besides, was she a common thief?&mdash;for, let a lady be
possessed with ever so prying a disposition, she would
not carry her mania to such a point as to steal a
letter&mdash;a sealed letter&mdash;unless she were absolutely
dishonest and unprincipled. Surely this could not
be the character of the woman whom he had seen
in such deep affliction that evening,&mdash;a woman who
was assuredly what she had represented herself to
be, and whose appearance, manners, and language
all forbade the idea that she was an abandoned
wretch.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I wrong her by entertaining such an injurious
suspicion even for an instant!” thought Lord
William, when those reflections had passed through
his brain. “It is impossible that this afflicted lady
can have taken my letter. Besides, had she done
so, would she have waited until my return? And
again, of what use&mdash;of what benefit could the letter
be to her?”</p>

<p>He glanced around, and beheld several articles of
value lying about in their accustomed places. He
had gone out in such a hurry that he had left a
purse containing gold upon the mantel&mdash;and, remembering
the precise amount, he reckoned it and
found it to be correct. Lying upon the table was a
splendid gold seal, which he had used in closing the
letter that was now missed:&mdash;in fine, there were
numerous objects, either costly or curious, which an
ill-disposed person might have self-appropriated,
but all of which had been left untouched.</p>

<p>How, then, was it possible to suppose that Mrs.
Sefton had purloined the letter?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it had disappeared; and therefore
some one must have taken it?&mdash;or else some accident
must have happened whereby it was lost?</p>

<p>Trevelyan racked his brain to discover whether
it was possible that he himself had removed it from
the mantel after he had placed it there: but he felt
assured that during the interval which elapsed
between the writing of that letter and the arrival
of Mrs. Sefton, he had not quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>The affair was most mysterious: nay&mdash;it was also
alarming;&mdash;for how could he possibly account for
the disappearance of a sealed letter? If it had
indeed been taken by an ill-disposed person, the
contents might be made known&mdash;perhaps to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
prejudice of his suit with Agnes. But he was
assured that no one had entered the room during
his absence;&mdash;and he was so reluctant to fix the
deed on Mrs. Sefton, and had so many reasons
against such a supposition, that he became equally
confident she was in no way connected with the
strange occurrence.</p>

<p>At length he reasoned himself into the belief that
he must have deposited the letter in some place
which he could not recollect; and, as he had in the
first instance made a rough draught, he resolved to
write a fair copy all over again. This was soon
accomplished; and, having sealed and addressed it,
he took the new letter with him to his own bed-chamber,
so that he might retain it in security
until Mrs. Mortimer should call for it in the
morning.</p>

<p>It was past two o’clock when Lord William
retired to rest; but, though much fatigued, he
could not immediately close his eyes in slumber.
The affair of the letter haunted him&mdash;filled him
with vague and undefined misgivings&mdash;and assumed
an aspect the more mysterious, the longer he contemplated
it. He endeavoured to persuade himself
that the belief to which he had ere now temporarily
lulled his mind was the real solution of the theory:
but then would come the evidence of memory, proclaiming
that he <em>had</em> placed the letter on the mantel
in the parlour, and that he had <em>not</em> touched it
afterwards.</p>

<p>In fine, he was bewildered amidst a variety of conflicting
thoughts&mdash;and his brain grew wearied with
the agitation which their jarring contention produced,&mdash;so
that at length sleep stole upon him insensibly:
but though it sealed his eyes in slumber,
it did not protect him against the troubled dreams
that visited his pillow.</p>

<p>At about nine o’clock in the morning he was
awakened by the entrance of his valet, who came to
inform him that Mrs. Mortimer had called for a
letter which was to be in readiness for her.</p>

<p>Trevelyan started up and glanced anxiously towards
the night-table, almost dreading lest that
second <em>billet</em> should have disappeared as well as the
first:&mdash;but it was there in safety&mdash;and he now desired
his dependant to deliver it to Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXVII">CHAPTER CLXVII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE LAWYER.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. James Heathcote, the attorney, was seated
at a writing-table covered with papers, in his private
office. He was wrapped in a loose dressing-gown,
and his feet were thrust into large buff slippers.
His grey hair was uncombed and his beard unshaven
that morning; and his shirt was none of the cleanest.
Indeed, his appearance denoted that, on
awakening, he had risen hastily, thrown on a few
clothes, and repaired straight to his office, where he
immediately became absorbed in the study of certain
documents in which he was deeply interested.</p>

<p>The countenance of this individual was by no
means pleasing. A malignant light shone in his
small, restless, dark eyes; and he had a habit, when
vexed or irritated, of frowning&mdash;or rather contracting
his brow to such a degree, that he brought
them as it were to cover his very eye-lids: but, if
pleased&mdash;especially when he had solved a difficult
question or was struck by an idea that seemed particularly
lucid or valuable&mdash;he would then elevate
his brows to such a height that the movement displayed
the whites all round his eyes, while the
upper part of his forehead gathered into innumerable
small wrinkles.</p>

<p>A superficial observer would have pronounced the
expression of his pale features to be intellectual:
but a more experienced phrenologist would be
enabled to draw the proper distinction between an
air of noble intelligence and one of profound cunning,
shrewdness, and selfish watchfulness. These
latter qualities were the real characteristics of
James Heathcote: but with his clerks, and amongst
the generality of his clients, he passed as a man of
very fine intellect and great talents.</p>

<p>The room in which he was seated had what is
usually called “a business-like air” about it. The
grey drugget that covered the door would have sustained
no harm from a vigorous application of a
carpet-broom; and the window, which looked into
a little yard at the back of the house, might have
lost much of its dinginess if only cleaned once a
week. But the panes appeared as if they had been
purposely tinged a dirty yellow, so incrusted were
they with the dust that had gathered upon them.</p>

<p>On one side of the room were rows of shelves
containing a number of law-books, the relative ages
of which were marked by the colour of the leather
binding&mdash;there being a perfect ascending scale, from
the bright buff, indicating the most recent purchase,
to the deepest, dirtiest brown that characterised
the long-standing and well-thumbed volume of
remote date. Along the edges of these shelves were
nailed long slips of dark-green serge&mdash;a meagre
kind of drapery meant to protect the upper part of
the volumes from the dust, and impart to the whole
arrangement somewhat of the air of a regular book-case.</p>

<p>On another side of the room were rows of shelves
much deeper and also much wider apart; and on
these were huge japanned tin boxes, with names
painted on them in yellow letters. To every box
there was a little padlock; and the whole seemed to
tell of title-deeds to vast estates&mdash;and mortgages&mdash;and
bonds&mdash;and charges&mdash;and rent-rolls, contained
in those sombre-looking repositories. But, alas!
how few of the persons whose names were still
recorded on the outside of those boxes, had any
longer an interest in the deeds preserved within:
how many had lodged their parchments in those
usurious chests, never to recover them!</p>

<p>Over the mantel-piece was a portrait of Lord
Eldon&mdash;a lawyer whom thousands and thousands
were doomed to curse, but whom the “profession”
still continues to cry up as the greatest of modern
judges. Yes&mdash;for if clients complain of the law’s
delays, the lawyers themselves rejoice; and he who
is an execrable judge in respect to the former, is an
admirable one in the eyes of the latter.</p>

<p>Stuck into the frame of that portrait was an infinite
number of visitors’ cards, all covered with
dust, as if that assemblage of bits of pasteboard were
something sacred which the profane hand of a housemaid
or charwoman dared not touch. On the mantel
itself was an old time-piece, the mechanism of
which was exposed; and how the wheels could
move at all, clogged with dust as they were, must
have appeared marvellous to any one who, entering
that room, gave himself the trouble to devote a
thought to the matter.</p>

<p>We have already stated that the table was covered
with papers. Along that side opposite to the one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
at which the lawyer sate, were piles of those documents,
all tied up in the usual fashion with tape
that once was red, but which was now so faded that
in many instances it was of a dirty white. They
seemed to have been undisturbed for a long, long
time; and perhaps were kept for show. Those
papers that referred to matters actually pending,
were placed more conveniently within the attorney’s
reach, and were fresher in appearance, the tape
also being of a livelier red. Three or four files, two
feet long, and covered with letters densely packed
one above another, lay upon the drugget; and near
the lawyer’s feet was a waste-basket overflowing
with letters crumpled up, and looking uncommonly
like appeals for mercy and delay on the part of unfortunate
debtors, but which had been tossed with
cool contempt into that receptacle for all such useless
applications!</p>

<p>It was now ten o’clock in the morning; and Mr.
James Heathcote was, as we have represented, completely
absorbed in the study of the documents that
lay spread before him upon the table. A thin, yellow
hand supported his head; and every now and
then he ran his long fingers through his iron-grey
hair, as if that action aided him in the solution of a
difficult subject.</p>

<p>Presently a low and timid knock at the door fell
on the lawyer’s ears; and he said “Come in” without
raising his head or desisting from his occupation.</p>

<p>Thereupon a middle-aged man, dressed in a suit of
rusty black&mdash;his office garb&mdash;made his appearance,
holding in his hand a long thin book which was the
diary of the business-proceedings of the establishment.
This individual had a pale, sinister countenance,
with brown hair combed sleekly down over
his low forehead. He was, however, an important
personage in many respects&mdash;being Mr. Heathcote’s
head clerk, and exercising despotic sway over half-a-dozen
subordinates in the front office. With them
and towards poor clients or unfortunate debtors he
was cold&mdash;stern&mdash;harsh&mdash;and inexorable; but in
the presence of his employer he was cringing&mdash;mean&mdash;sycophantic&mdash;and
spaniel-like.</p>

<p>Advancing slowly and with noiseless steps&mdash;or
rather creeping up towards the table, he stood in a
respectful attitude&mdash;no, with a servile demeanour
and in deep silence until it should please his master
to take notice of him.</p>

<p>“Well, Green&mdash;what have you to say to me this
morning?” at length demanded Mr. Heathcote,
raising his head and throwing himself back in his
capacious arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Gregson the upholsterer, sir, cannot meet the
third instalment due this day on his warrant-of-attorney
for eight hundred pounds,” said Mr. Green,
referring to the diary; “but he called just now and
told me that if you would give him till next Monday&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not an hour, Green,” interrupted Mr. Heathcote,
imperiously. “Let execution issue. He has
enough property to satisfy the greater portion&mdash;and,
as his brother-in-law is his security, we shall slap
at him without delay for the residue. He is a
toiling, striving man, and will beat up amongst his
friends to raise the necessary amount by the time
we have run him up some twenty pounds’ costs.
What is the next?”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas Skeffington’s bill for five hundred
pounds comes due to-day, sir,” continued the head
clerk; “and he proposes to renew it.”</p>

<p>“Let me see?” mused Mr. Heathcote. “It was
originally two hundred pounds that I lent this
young spendthrift baronet; and he has already
renewed six times. Well&mdash;let him give another
bill&mdash;for five hundred and fifty, mind&mdash;don’t forget
to tack on the fifty, Green. His uncle will pay the
debt eventually&mdash;it is all safe. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Thompson, sir, the defendant in Jones’s case,
has let judgment go by default,” continued Mr.
Green: “he says that he would do anything rather
than run up expenses; and he has been here this
morning to beg and implore that time may be
granted. His wife has just been confined, and his
eldest child is at the point of death. The debt is
a hundred and eleven pounds with costs&mdash;and he
proposes to pay it at five pounds a week.”</p>

<p>“No such thing!” exclaimed Mr. Heathcote, almost
savagely. “Let him go to prison! He will
be writing imploring letters, and his father-in-law
will call to make terms. Those letters and visits,
Green, will be another six or seven pounds in my
pocket: and <em>then</em> we will let him out on his warrant-of-attorney
to pay the five pounds a-week. It
is always better to send a man in his case to prison
first, although you mean all the time to accede
to his proposal in the long run. He is an industrious,
enterprising fellow&mdash;and his father-in-law
is a highly respectable man. So he will not
knock up for this little affair. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Beale’s wife called last evening, sir,” resumed
Mr. Green, “and says that her husband is lying in
a sad state in the infirmary at Whitecross-street
prison. She and her children are starving&mdash;and she
begs you for the love of God to let her husband
out. It is their only chance; and he will pay you
when he can.”</p>

<p>“When he can!” exclaimed Mr. Heathcote, in bitter
contempt. “And that will be <em>never</em>. I am surprised,
Mr. Green, that you should have bothered
me with such a trifle, instead of telling the woman
at once that her husband may rot in gaol until he
pays me every farthing.”</p>

<p>“I should not have thought of troubling you, sir,
in the matter,” observed the clerk, in a tone of servile
contrition; “only the woman did seem so very,
very miserable&mdash;and she cried so bitterly&mdash;and she
had a young child that looked half-famished in her
arms&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you pitied her, I suppose?” interrupted
Mr. Heathcote, in a tone of cool irony. “You have
been in my service for twelve years to some purpose.”</p>

<p>“Pray forgive me, sir: but&mdash;but&mdash;I happen to know
that Beale’s wife and family are really starving,”
said the clerk, whose heart was a trifle less hardened
than that of his master.</p>

<p>“Let them starve!” rejoined the latter, with an
air of brutal indifference. “Now, what have you
next upon your list?”</p>

<p>“William Fox, the ironmonger, sir, has called a
meeting of his creditors,” resumed Mr. Green, now
regretting that he should have allowed himself to be
carried away by a scintillation of humane feeling so
far as to merit a rebuke at Mr. Heathcote’s hands.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I know that,” observed the lawyer. “But
<em>I</em> never attend meetings of creditors&mdash;<em>I</em> never accept
compositions, Mr. Green. But has the fellow been
here? and what does he say?”</p>

<p>“It appears, sir, that he laid a full and complete
account of his affairs before his creditors,” continued
the clerk; “and that they were well satisfied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
with the statement. He showed them that his embarrassments
arose from no fault of his own, but
simply from the failure of a large house in Birmingham.”</p>

<p>“And what did he offer?” demanded Mr. Heathcote.</p>

<p>“He asked for two years to pay off all his liabilities,”
was the answer. “He did not propose a composition,
but will settle everything in full. His
brother has offered to become security for him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he must pay me at once&mdash;within twenty-four
hours&mdash;or I shall sign judgment, Green,” exclaimed
the lawyer. “Or stop&mdash;it will be better to
sign judgment at once, and issue execution. I shall
then, get my money directly&mdash;and his other creditors
may wait the two years. If he calls again to-day,
tell him that I am out&mdash;and mind and have a
seizure in his house by the evening.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done, sir,” said the head clerk: then,
again referring to the diary, he proceeded thus:&mdash;“You
remember that affair of Williamson, sir? He
called and left seventy-two pounds the other evening
to take up his bill, which had been sent back;
and as you were out at the time, he could not have
the bill delivered over to him. I offered him a receipt
for the money: but he left it without taking
any acknowledgment&mdash;saying, ‘<em>Oh! I can trust to
your honour</em>,’&mdash;or words to that effect. Well, sir,
he has called two or three times since for the
bill&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do the other clerks know that he paid the
money?” demanded Mr. Heathcote, fixing his keen
eyes significantly upon Green.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the answer, accompanied by a
look of intelligence showing that the man comprehended
his master’s meaning. “They were all
gone&mdash;and I was just on the point of leaving likewise
when Williamson called.”</p>

<p>“Then issue a writ this very day for the recovery
of the amount,” said the lawyer. “Of course,
Green, you will know nothing at all about having
received the money from him?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, sir,” replied the clerk.</p>

<p>“And should he go to trial, you will swear that
he never paid you?” continued the lawyer, speaking
with the imperious authority of a man who
knew that the other was in his power.</p>

<p>“It would not be the first time, sir, that I have
perjured&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well!” cried Mr. Heathcote, hastily; for
though he did not mind suborning his clerk to
commit a crime, yet he did not like to have the
deed designated in plain terms and exhibited to his
eyes in all its dreadful nakedness and reality. “Let
this be done, Green: and take a guinea for yourself&mdash;charging
it in the office-expenses of the week.
You are a faithful servant&mdash;and I am pleased with
you,” he added, in a patronising manner.</p>

<p>“I am truly grateful, sir, for your kindness and for
your good opinion,” said the clerk, with a low bow:
but at the same time he was compelled to stifle the
sigh that rose to his very lips at the idea of being
so dependent upon his master, and so enthralled by
circumstances as to be compelled to submit to be
made the tool&mdash;the base instrument&mdash;the despicable
agent of that master’s hidden villany.</p>

<p>“Have you anything more in the diary?” demanded
Mr. Heathcote.</p>

<p>“Nothing, sir,” responded the clerk: “unless
it be that the two doctors are to call to-day for the
second halves of the reward promised them for
signing the certificate.”</p>

<p>“Good! pay them each immediately, the affair having
been attended with complete success,” said the
lawyer: “and indeed, you may give them each
five guineas beyond the sum originally promised.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done, sir,” returned Mr. Green.
“Have you any farther commands?”</p>

<p>“I am at a loss how to proceed with respect to
that woman,” said Mr. Heathcote, his brows lowering
in token of vexation, while at the same time he
ran his skinny fingers through his wiry hair.</p>

<p>“You mean Mrs. Sefton, sir?” said the clerk.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sefton&mdash;as she calls herself,” observed
Mr. Heathcote, with a grim smile. “Ah! little
thought Gilbert,” he continued in a musing, but
also triumphant tone, “that for years past I have
known all and everything connected with him!
Little did he imagine that his <em>liaison</em>&mdash;his amour
with that lady was no secret to me, secure and safe
as he deemed it to be from all the world! But
what am I do with regard to her, Green?” he demanded,
as he abruptly turned towards the clerk,
who stood like a menial in his presence.</p>

<p>“Your wisdom, sir, can doubtless suggest some
plan,” was the sycophantic reply. “Do you imagine
that she is likely to be dangerous?”</p>

<p>“She loves my brother, Green,” answered the
lawyer: “she entertains for him that passion which
never has warmed my breast&mdash;and never shall,” he
continued, in a contemptuous tone. “Oh! how I
hate the very name of love! It is a sickly sentimentalism&mdash;a
maudlin feeling, which is derogatory
to the character of a man of the world, but which
makes a woman dangerous indeed, when the object
of her passion is outraged or wronged. Yes, Green&mdash;I
do fear this Mrs. Sefton, as we will call her&mdash;since
thus she chooses to denominate herself: I do
consider her to be dangerous&mdash;and I know that she
is of an intrepid, resolute character. She will leave
no stone unturned to have what she will call <em>justice</em>
done towards my brother; and by some means
must I take from her the power of doing me an
injury.”</p>

<p>“And those means, sir?” asked the clerk, timidly.</p>

<p>“I have thought of many plans, Green,” replied
Mr. Heathcote: “but not one appears to be sufficiently
decisive to meet the exigencies of the case.
Could I only get her out of the country, or else
have her locked up in some place of security, for a
few weeks, I should in that interval have all my
schemes so effectually carried out, as to be able to
defy not only that woman, but likewise all the
world.”</p>

<p>“And is it so very difficult, sir, to encompass one
or the other of the two aims you have mentioned?”
inquired Green.</p>

<p>“On what pretence can I imprison her?” demanded
Mr. Heathcote, impatiently. “But I <em>might</em>
be able to induce her to quit the country,” he added,
in a more measured tone, and with a steadfast look
at his clerk&mdash;a look which seemed to say, “Can I
trust you?”</p>

<p>“Is there any way, sir, wherein my humble services
will avail?” asked the man, thoroughly understanding
the intent of that look.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;on you must I rely in this matter,” said
the lawyer, after a few minutes’ deep cogitation.
“Mr. Green,” continued Heathcote, again fixing on
him his small, malignant, soul-reading eyes, “you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
will excuse me for a moment if I recall the past to
your recollection&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But why, sir&mdash;why!” exclaimed the clerk, his
pale face suddenly becoming paler still and his limbs
trembling convulsively.</p>

<p>“Because I choose,” returned his master, brutally:
“because it suits my present purpose to
remind you how much you are in my power.”</p>

<p>The wretched clerk moaned audibly, but uttered
not another word.</p>

<p>“Twelve years ago, Mr. Green,” resumed Heathcote,
with deep emphasis and in a measured tone,
as if he were determined that not a syllable which
he intended to say should be lost on the unhappy
man who was thus undergoing a painful&mdash;agonising
infliction,&mdash;“twelve years ago, Mr. Green, you were
an attorney in practice for yourself. An accident,
the particulars of which it is not necessary for me
to recite, made me acquainted with a fact which
placed you entirely at my mercy. You and a gentleman
named Clarence Villiers had been left the
joint guardians of a boy then a little more than eight
years old; and a thousand pounds were invested in
the funds in the name of yourself and the said Clarence
Villiers. It had been agreed that you should
be the acting trustee. You wanted money&mdash;you
forged the name of Clarence Villiers to the necessary
deed&mdash;and you sold out the thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>The miserable clerk groaned again, more audibly
than before: but his master heeded not the intense
agony his words inflicted.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you sold out the money, and appropriated
it to your purposes,” continued the remorseless
attorney. “The fact came to my knowledge,&mdash;and
I offered to save you, on condition that you should
serve me&mdash;that you should devote yourself to me,
body and soul&mdash;that you should see only with my
eyes, hear only with my ears, and use your hands
and your intellectual powers as I directed. I required
a person of this description: I was looking
out for such an one at the moment when accident
thus placed you in my power. We soon came to
terms. You gave up a business that was not worth
retaining&mdash;and you became my head clerk. I have
paid you two guineas a week with the most scrupulous
regularity&mdash;and I have often made you little
presents, as even this very morning have I done.
But what more have I been generous enough to do
for you? Why&mdash;I have regularly paid the interest
of the thousand pounds for you, as if it were still in
the Bank of England; and your ward suspects not
that his capital is gone. Neither does your co-trustee
Clarence Villiers suspect it, Mr. Green,” added
Heathcote, emphatically. “But in six weeks’ time,
the youth will have completed his twenty-first
year; and he will apply to Mr. Villiers and yourself
for his thousand pounds. Mr. Villiers will ask to
accompany you to the Bank to make over the money
in due form&mdash;for Mr. Villiers is an honourable man.
But the money will not be there&mdash;unless I replace
it for you, and thus save you from transportation
for life!”</p>

<p>“And you have promised that you will replace
it, kind sir&mdash;you have undertaken to save me from
exposure, degradation, and punishment!” exclaimed
the clerk, his voice and manner becoming almost
wild in the earnestness of their appeal.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and I will keep my word, Green,” responded
Heathcote. “If I have now recapitulated
circumstances which are necessarily so indelibly
stamped upon your memory, it was merely to convince
you that I have it in my power to save you
from a terrible fate&mdash;or to crush you as I would a
viper beneath my heel. We shall not be the worse
friends because we understand our relative positions;
and mark me&mdash;never, never would I place
myself in the power of a man unless he were ten
thousand times more entangled in my meshes than
I could possibly be in his.”</p>

<p>“Surely&mdash;surely, sir, you do not suspect my
fidelity?” said the clerk, the workings of whose
pale countenance were dreadful to behold; “surely
you do not think that I should be ungrateful or
mad enough to breathe a word to your prejudice?
If you have done much for me, sir, I have served
you faithfully; and this I can assert without fear
of contradiction. I am ever at your disposal&mdash;ever
in readiness to obey your commands, without
questioning their propriety.”</p>

<p>“All this I know, my friend,” said Heathcote,
his brows now elevating themselves with triumph;
for he saw that the trembling wretch before him
was docile, pliant, and obedient as a deaf and
dumb slave following the signals made by an
oriental despot: “all this I know,” repeated the
lawyer;&mdash;“but there is no harm in occasionally
setting forth the grounds on which our connexion
is based. This being accomplished in the present
instance, we may at once revert to the business
that we have now in hand.”</p>

<p>“Relative to Mrs. Sefton, sir?” remarked Green,
anxious to convince his master that he was mindful
of the grave and important interests now involved
in connexion with that lady’s name.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;relative to Mrs. Sefton,” said Heathcote.
“I have already observed that there are only two
ways of dealing with her: either to lock her up in
a place of security for a time, or to get her out of the
country. The latter alternative must be adopted;
and it is for you to play a part which, if ingeniously
enacted, cannot fail of success.”</p>

<p>Mr. Green placed himself in an attitude of deep
attention&mdash;for all this while, as the reader will observe,
he had remained standing, his master never
desiring him to be seated, however long their conference
might last.</p>

<p>“The impatience of this Mrs. Sefton is doubtless
growing intolerable,” continued the lawyer: “a
week has now passed since Sir Gilbert disappeared&mdash;and
she will speedily initiate active measures
to discover what has become of him. There is not
therefore another moment to lose;&mdash;and her own
affection shall be made the means of which we
will avail ourselves in order to baffle and defeat
her. Do you repair at once to Kentish Town
and seek an interview with her. She does not
know you&mdash;she never saw you: she will suspect
nothing&mdash;but believe everything. You will tell
her that you have just arrived from Liverpool&mdash;that
you are an intimate friend of Sir Gilbert&mdash;and
that he has embarked for America, in consequence
of serious pecuniary embarrassments. You
must assure her that those embarrassments came
on him so suddenly, menacing his person with
arrest&mdash;and that he was so bewildered and excited
by the danger and disgrace which thus threatened
him, that he fled without having time to communicate
even with her. You will then go on to say that
he sent you up to London to break these news to
her&mdash;to supply her with money&mdash;and to implore
her to hasten after Sir Gilbert, whom she will join
at New York. All this must you tell her;&mdash;and if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
you play your part properly, it is, as I have already
observed, certain to experience success.”</p>

<p>“You may rely upon me, sir,” said the clerk.</p>

<p>“All your presence of mind&mdash;all your readiness
of invention&mdash;all your impudence, will be requisite
in the matter,” continued Heathcote: “for Mrs.
Sefton is an intelligent woman&mdash;and the least
hesitation in giving a reply to any of her questions,
will assuredly awaken her suspicions, and spoil all.
But if you be wary and cautious, you must come
off triumphant. Believing that her connexion with
Sir Gilbert is a profound secret, she will at once
receive you as a friend of her lover’s, from the
mere fact of your knowledge of their <em>liaison</em>: because
she will suppose that you could not have
become aware of it, unless he had in reality made
you his confident. Then, again, the circumstance
of your being the bearer of fifty guineas&mdash;which
I will presently give you&mdash;as the means to defray
the expenses of her voyage to New York, will
confirm all you have stated and give a complete
colouring to all your representations. Do you
thoroughly understand me, Green?&mdash;and do you
consider yourself competent to undertake this
mission?&mdash;for I can assure you that it is of the
highest importance for me to remove that dangerous
woman from England for a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“I do not hesitate to charge myself with the
enterprise, sir,” said Green, meekly,&mdash;“delicate
though its management may be;&mdash;and, should it
fail, it will be through no fault on my part.”</p>

<p>“Then it will <em>not</em> fail, sir!” cried Mr. Heathcote,
emphatically. “And now I will give you the money
necessary for your purpose&mdash;and you must accompany
the lady to Liverpool, remember. If a packet
be not about to start immediately, then lodge her at
an hotel, alleging that you are an unmarried man
as an apology for not inviting her to stay at your
own house until her departure. You can put up at
another hotel. But all these minor details I leave
to your judgment and discretion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Heathcote now placed a quantity of notes
and some gold in the hands of his clerk, who forthwith
took leave of his wily master: ere he departed,
however, he stopped in the outer office to issue instructions
relative to the various matters entered in
the diary. At length he was ready to issue forth
on the mission entrusted to him; but at that moment
a cab stopped at the door, and a tall, handsome,
well-dressed gentleman alighted.</p>

<p>Entering the clerk’s office, the visitor inquired if
Mr. Heathcote was at home.</p>

<p>“What name shall I say, sir?” asked Green.</p>

<p>“That is of no consequence,” was the hasty reply:
“my business is of great importance.”</p>

<p>“Walk in, then, if you please, sir,” said Green:
and, having shown the visitor into the lawyer’s private
apartment, the head clerk was at length enabled
to hurry away to his own lodgings, in order to
make some change in his toilette ere he proceeded
to Kentish Town.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXVIII">CHAPTER CLXVIII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE NOBLEMAN AND THE LAWYER.</span></h2>

<p>On entering into the presence of Mr. Heathcote,
the handsome visitor tendered his card; and the
moment the lawyer cast his eyes upon it, a cloud
passed hastily over his countenance&mdash;for he knew
that Lord William Trevelyan, whose name appeared
on that card, was an intimate friend of Sir Gilbert.
He however composed himself in an instant, and,
pointing to a chair, said, “Be seated, my lord.”</p>

<p>The young nobleman accepted the invitation, and
then observed, “I have to apologise for intruding
myself upon you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not if you come on matters of business, my
lord,” interrupted the lawyer, in a tone which was
intended to imply that his time was nevertheless
very precious.</p>

<p>“I fear that you will scarcely consider my visit
to be connected with business in the sense you
would have me infer,” said Trevelyan, courteously:
“at the same time, you will give me credit for the
best intentions&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pray, my lord, come to the point,” exclaimed
Heathcote, impatiently. “I have a vast amount
of work upon my hands&mdash;several appointments to
keep&mdash;and my toilette not yet performed.”</p>

<p>“In one word, sir,” said Trevelyan, “may I inquire
if you have received any tidings concerning
your brother, who is a dear and valued friend of
mine?”</p>

<p>“I have heard that my brother is absent, my
lord,” answered Heathcote, coldly: “but I have no
control over his movements&mdash;and he is not in the
habit of consulting me respecting his actions.”</p>

<p>“At the same time, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my lord: I have answered you&mdash;and
I have not a moment to spare.”</p>

<p>“But as your brother’s friend, sir&mdash;his intimate
friend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do not know you, my lord: neither do I
trouble myself with my brother’s friendships.”</p>

<p>These last words were uttered so rudely&mdash;almost
brutally, that the young nobleman’s countenance
became the colour of scarlet, and he felt that were
the lawyer a man less advanced in years, he would
have knocked him down for his insolence.</p>

<p>“I am aware, sir,” he said, subduing his indignation
as well as he was able, “that I have no
claim upon your courtesy, beyond that which social
conventions establish: but I regret to find that
you should think it necessary to treat with such
extreme incivility a person who has never offended
you.”</p>

<p>“Then wherefore does your lordship force yourself
into my presence, and persist in remaining
here, when I tell you that I am occupied with
serious matters?” demanded the lawyer, rising from
his seat, while his brows were bent in such a way
as to render his countenance particularly displeasing
and sinister at that moment.</p>

<p>“Serious matters, indeed!” ejaculated Lord
William, also rising; “is it not a serious matter
that your brother&mdash;your own brother&mdash;has suddenly
disappeared&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have already told your lordship that I have
no control over the actions of Sir Gilbert Heathcote,”
said the lawyer; “and I am not to be forced
into a discussion on any subject with one who is a
complete stranger to me.”</p>

<p>“I repeat, sir, that I am your brother’s intimate
friend,” cried the young patrician, indignantly.</p>

<p>“But I repeat, on my side, that you are no friend
of mine&mdash;nor likely to be,” responded Heathcote.
“Will your lordship, therefore, leave me to those
pursuits which have better claims upon my time
and attention?”</p>

<p>“Better claims! And yet you must surely have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
some of the ordinary feelings of human nature,”
urged the nobleman, in a tone of mingled remonstrance
and earnest appeal. “One word more, if
you please, sir,” he continued, seeing that Heathcote
was again about to interrupt him: “this matter
is becoming serious! For eight days has your
brother been missed from his place of abode and
from the circle of his friends: an investigation into
so mysterious an occurrence must necessarily take
place&mdash;and without delay, too. What will the world
think of you, sir&mdash;<em>you</em>, the nearest living relative
of one who may perhaps be no more&mdash;if you refuse
your co-operation in this endeavour to ascertain
what has become of him? I will even go farther,
sir, and declare that a certain degree of odium will
attach itself to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Young man, by what right do you thus insult
me?” demanded the lawyer, completely unabashed,
and measuring Lord William Trevelyan from head
to foot with his keen, searching eyes. “Do you for
a single instant dare to assert that if my brother
should have met with foul play&mdash;as your words just
now implied such a suspicion,&mdash;do you dare to
assert, I ask, that the world would couple the
slightest imputation with my good name? Though
not of an aristocratic rank, my social position is an
honourable one; and such as it is, my own talents&mdash;my
own energies&mdash;my own hard toils, have made it.
But because I can see nothing extraordinary in the
absence of a man who has no domestic ties to bind
him to one place, and who, acting upon a sudden
caprice or fancy, may choose to depart from the
metropolis, perhaps,&mdash;because I behold nothing remarkable
in all this, am I to be reproached, vituperated,
and even insulted by you, who adopt another
view of the matter? Why, my lord, you are far
more intimate with Sir Gilbert Heathcote than I,
even though he is my brother;&mdash;and what would
you say, were I to repair to your house&mdash;force myself
into your presence&mdash;refuse to leave when solicited&mdash;and
actually level the most injurious language,
amounting almost to positive imputations, at
your head? I appeal to your good sense, if you
possess any, to consider the impropriety of your
conduct here this morning, and to take your departure
at once, before you irritate me more deeply
than you have already done.”</p>

<p>“I have listened, sir, with respectful attention to
all you have said,” returned Lord William Trevelyan;
“and I declare emphatically that I am not
satisfied with your reasoning. I impute nothing to
you&mdash;because I know not what suspicions to entertain
in the case. I frankly confess that I am
bewildered, not only by the fact of my friend’s
unaccountable disappearance, but also by the
manner in which you treat that circumstance. You
declare that you cannot bring yourself to look seriously
on this disappearance: surely it ought to alarm
you, when I, who am so well acquainted with your
brother, solemnly aver that I have particular reasons
for knowing that he would <em>not</em> leave the metropolis
in obedience to any sudden fancy or whim, without
previously making a communication in a certain
quarter.”</p>

<p>“To you, I presume?” said Heathcote, fixing his
eyes searchingly upon the patrician.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not to myself,” was the reply: “but to
another.”</p>

<p>“And that other?” observed the lawyer interrogatively:
for he now began to fear that Trevelyan
alluded to Mrs. Sefton, in which case he might
repair straight to her abode after quitting that
office&mdash;he might there meet the clerk whom he had
seen on his arrival just now&mdash;and he might mar the
entire scheme that had been concocted for the purpose
of inducing the lady to leave England.</p>

<p>“Unless you yourself are acquainted with <em>that
other person</em> to whom I alluded&mdash;or at least have
some knowledge to whom I could so allude&mdash;I am
not at liberty to make any revelations,” observed
Lord William.</p>

<p>“Oh! this is admirable!” ejaculated the lawyer,
reseating himself and appearing no longer in a hurry
to break off the conference: for he now perceived
the necessity of detaining the nobleman
as long as possible, so as to afford Green ample
time to carry the deeply-concocted scheme into
effect.</p>

<p>“You are pleased to be jocular at something,
sir,” said Trevelyan, biting his lip with vexation at
an insolence which he could not chastise: and
leaning against the mantel-piece, he surveyed the
attorney with mingled anger and aversion.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I am jocular,” exclaimed the latter; “and
I again declare that your conduct is admirable!
You come to me to aid you in investigating what
you are pleased to denominate a most mysterious
occurrence; and, by way of inducing me thus to
co-operate, you yourself start fresh mysteries, and
make enigmatic allusions to unintelligible matters,
concerning which you refuse to enter into any explanations.”</p>

<p>“There may be certain circumstances, sir, which
a man of honour dares not reveal,” said Lord William,
sternly; “and such is the case in the present
instance.”</p>

<p>“You have therefore a positive proof that Sir
Gilbert’s friends were more in his confidence than
his own brother,” replied the lawyer, in a sarcastic
tone; “and this is tantamount to what I told you
just now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;but the circumstances to which I
allude have no reference to the mysterious disappearance
of Sir Gilbert Heathcote,” rejoined Trevelyan;
“nor do they in any way relieve you from
your responsibility as a brother.”</p>

<p>“But, since you yourself are acquainted with some
mysterious and unmentionable circumstances connected
with my brother,” said the lawyer, still in a
tone of bitter sarcasm, “I have much more reason
to accuse you of possessing a clue to the causes of
his disappearance, than you have to level the same
charge at me. Now, from your words&mdash;for I am a
man of the world, my lord&mdash;I naturally infer that
the <em>other person</em> to whom you so emphatically alluded,
must be a lady&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I did not say so, sir&mdash;I gave you no reason for
entertaining such an opinion,” exclaimed Trevelyan
fearful of now compromising a matter of great
delicacy.</p>

<p>“But I choose to think so,” said the lawyer, elevating
his brows to an extraordinary degree, while
a malignant light gleamed in his restless eyes: “and
is it strange&mdash;is it unusual in the world, for a man
to absent himself suddenly and even mysteriously,
in order to break off a connexion of which he is
wearied, and which no longer has any charms for
him?”</p>

<p>“One word, sir,” interjected Trevelyan, annoyed
with himself for having made any allusion to his
friend’s connexion with Mrs. Sefton: “your brother
has undertaken no sudden journey&mdash;of <em>that</em> I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
well assured. Would he quit his residence without
leaving even a message behind him? Would he
depart without even so much as a change of raiment&mdash;without
the necessaries of the toilette?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! pooh!” ejaculated the lawyer, now throwing
an expression of sovereign contempt into his
tone. “A man with money can purchase a carpetbag
or a portmanteau at the first town he stops at,
and can stock it well, too, with linen and hairbrushes
for a few shillings. Really, my lord, you
compel me to treat you as an inexperienced child,
who, having got some wild or romantic notion into
his head, is determined to maintain it by any argument,
no matter how preposterous or far-fetched.”</p>

<p>Trevelyan bit his lip again: for he saw that the
lawyer had really the advantage of him now; and
he more than ever blamed his own indiscretion in
having alluded to the affair of Mrs. Sefton.</p>

<p>“Come, my lord, be reasonable,” proceeded Heathcote,
in a conciliatory tone; “and I will pardon you
the rudeness&mdash;or I will rather call it the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brusquerie</em>,
of your first proceedings with regard to me. You
cannot deny that there is a lady in the case: I am
far-sighted enough to have made that discovery.
Well, my brother is tired of her, or has quarrelled
with her&mdash;or something of that sort; and he has
therefore taken a sudden trip, heaven only knows
where. Do you really imagine that if I had any
serious fears, I would refuse to co-operate with you
in instituting the necessary inquiries? Depend
upon it, Sir Gilbert will re-appear again shortly
amongst his friends; and he would not be over-well
pleased if he found on his return, or if the
newspapers wafted to him the fact, that a terrible
hubbub had taken place in consequence of his sudden
departure. I am a much older man than you,
my lord,&mdash;and I look at these matters more calmly&mdash;more
deliberately.”</p>

<p>Trevelyan knew not how to reply to these observations.
Though they did not dissipate the alarm
which he experienced at the absence of Sir Gilbert,
yet he began to think that the lawyer was really
sincere in giving utterance to them. He, on one
side, was disposed to view the affair seriously:
Heathcote, on the other, put his own interpretation
on it;&mdash;and, in the same way that Trevelyan could
not resist the impressions made upon himself, he
felt bound to allow the merit of equal conscientiousness
on the part of the attorney.</p>

<p>At all events, there was no utility in protracting
the discourse; and the young nobleman accordingly
resolved to take his leave, suspending for the present
any opinion relative to the conduct of Mr.
James Heathcote.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, sir,” said he, “that I should have
intruded so long upon your valuable time: I am
likewise sorry if, at the commencement of our interview,
I should have been hurried by the excitement
of my feelings into anything uncourteous or
rude.”</p>

<p>“Now that you speak in the manner that best
becomes a nobleman and a gentleman,” observed
Heathcote, adopting the part of one who has something
to forgive and overlook, “I am most anxious
to welcome you as my brother’s friend. Will you
step up into the drawing-room, and honour my
humble abode so far as to partake of such refreshment
as at the moment I can offer you?”</p>

<p>This proposal was only made with a view to
gain as much time as possible: for the lawyer in
his heart had cordially hated the young nobleman
from the instant that he had read his name upon
the card.</p>

<p>“I return you my best thanks, sir,” said Trevelyan;
“but I am compelled to decline your hospitality
on the present occasion.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the young nobleman bowed and retired;
and the moment the door closed behind him,
the lawyer’s countenance assumed an expression of
such malignant triumph, that it seemed as if he
were suddenly animated with the spirit of a fiend.</p>

<p>“Green has got her off by this time&mdash;there can
be no doubt of <em>that</em>,” he muttered to himself, as he
rubbed his mummy-like hands gleefully together.
“The woman loves my brother&mdash;and she will start
away directly. Even her vanity will not induce
her to tarry to pack up all her things, unless they are
ready to hand; for the love of a woman who is
sincere in her passion, rises superior to every other
consideration. Oh! I know the human heart well;
I know all its intricacies&mdash;its ins and its outs&mdash;the
ravellings and unravellings of its smallest, most
delicate fibres! It has been my business to study
my fellow-creatures, in order that I might make
them my instruments&mdash;my tools&mdash;my slaves. And
I have succeeded!” he continued, with a chuckling
laugh, while his brows were elevated with joy.
“Otherwise I should not be the rich man that I
am now. But if my wealth be already great&mdash;it
must be greater. I must possess countless treasures&mdash;riches
beyond computation; and until I have
gained <em>them</em> I shall not be satisfied&mdash;neither shall
I cease from toiling. That young aristocratic fool
who was with me ere now&mdash;he affected to bully me,
did he? I got the better of him. He affected to
reason with me: I beat him with pure sophism,&mdash;and
he has gone away entertaining a better opinion
of me than when he first entered my presence. But
I must examine these abstracts thoroughly,” he
added, still in a muttering tone, as he bent his eyes
upon the documents which he had been studying;
“I must note every point in these copies of the titles
by virtue of which my brother holds his estates&mdash;for
the management of these estates is already as
good as in my own hands: and who knows&mdash;who
knows how soon they may be mine altogether&mdash;yes&mdash;lands,
messuages, tenements&mdash;aye, baronetcy
and all?”</p>

<p>And as these last thoughts passed through his
brain,&mdash;for he had not dared to give audible utterance
to <em>them</em>,&mdash;there came such a diabolical expression&mdash;an
expression of dark menace strangely mingled
with the confidence of approaching triumph&mdash;over
his countenance, that had any one been by at
the time, the beholder must have dreaded lest that
terrible man were about to throw off the mask of
humanity and reveal himself in all the horrors of a
demoniac nature.</p>

<p>We must however take leave of him for the
present, and return to one whose generous and
noble character forms such a striking contrast
with this bad, designing man.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXIX">CHAPTER CLXIX.<br />

<span class="medium">A SCENE.</span></h2>

<p>Lord William entered his cab, and drove
rapidly away towards Kentish Town.</p>

<p>It was mid-day when he reached the abode of
Mrs. Sefton&mdash;for his interview with the attorney
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
had been a very long one: but at length his
equipage stopped at the gate of a beautiful little
villa standing in the midst of a garden well laid
out, and having iron railings along the side adjoining
the main-road.</p>

<div id="i_249" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_249.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Leaping from the vehicle, Lord William opened
the gate and hastened up to the front door, which
was immediately opened to his summons, by a
little page in a plain but neat livery.</p>

<p>To his inquiry whether Mrs. Sefton were at
home, an answer in the affirmative was given&mdash;the
boy however adding that his mistress was engaged
at the moment.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the response thus conveyed, when
the lady herself, having caught the sound of the
young patrician’s voice, came forth from a parlour
opening from the hall; and, tendering him her
hand, she said, “Oh! I am so glad you are come,
my lord&mdash;for I am cruelly bewildered how to act!”</p>

<p>“Has anything new transpired, madam?” asked
Trevelyan, unable to gather anything decisive from
the expression of her countenance, which seemed
to denote mingled hope and uncertainty&mdash;a gleam
of satisfaction shining from amidst dark clouds of
suspense.</p>

<p>“Come with me, my lord,” she said; “and you
will advise me how to act.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she led the way into the parlour,
followed by Trevelyan.</p>

<p>A man rose from a chair on his entrance; and
the sinister countenance of that individual appeared
to be not altogether unfamiliar to the
young patrician, who could not however conjecture
at the moment where he had seen or met
that person before.</p>

<p>The individual himself seemed to recognise the
nobleman&mdash;or at least to be troubled by his presence:
but, almost immediately recovering his self-possession,
he bowed low and resumed his seat.</p>

<p>“This gentleman, my lord,” said Mrs. Sefton, “is
a Mr. Green of Liverpool,&mdash;and he has brought me
strange&mdash;nay, the strangest tidings relative to Sir
Gilbert.”</p>

<p>“And what may those tidings be, madam?” asked
Trevelyan, addressing his words to the lady, but
keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously on Mr. Green
all the time.</p>

<p>“Remember, madam, that all I have said has
been in the strictest confidence!” exclaimed the
latter hastily, and with a manner which only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
tended to increase the young nobleman’s suspicions.</p>

<p>“But Lord William Trevelyan is an intimate&mdash;a
very intimate friend of Sir Gilbert,” said Mrs.
Sefton.</p>

<p>“It matters not, madam,” observed Mr. Green:
“my instructions were positive&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It matters greatly, however, sir,” interrupted
the lady. “Your tale appeared to me strange and
inconsistent from the very first&mdash;though Heaven
knows what motive you can have in deceiving me
so cruelly, if deceit it be: but now my suspicions
are painfully increased&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Madam, you know not what you are saying,”
exclaimed Green: “you are insulting me, after all
the trouble I have taken in this matter. But have
your own way&mdash;my presence is no longer necessary
here.”</p>

<p>And, rising from his seat, he was moving towards
the door, when a light suddenly broke in upon
Trevelyan’s mind&mdash;and it flashed to his recollection
that he had encountered this individual that very
forenoon in the office of Mr. James Heathcote,
the attorney.</p>

<p>“Stop, sir!” he cried, seizing the clerk by the
collar of his coat, and forcibly detaining him: “we
have met before&mdash;I know you now! Scarcely two
hours have elapsed since you conducted me into
the presence of Mr. Heathcote, who is doubtless
your master.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Heathcote!” ejaculated Mrs. Sefton, a
deadly pallor covering her countenance. “Ah!
then my suspicions are to be confirmed&mdash;and he is
persecuting <em>me</em> now!”</p>

<p>“Be seated, sir,” said Trevelyan, pushing the
discomfited clerk back into the chair which he had
so recently left. “And now, madam,” he continued,
turning towards the lady, “will you have
the kindness to explain to me all that this man has
told you&mdash;the object of his visit, in fine?”</p>

<p>“Oh! my lord, what hideous treachery is at
work!” exclaimed Mrs. Sefton, sinking upon a
sofa, almost overcome by the varied emotions that
agitated in her bosom. “This man introduced himself
to me as Mr. Green of Liverpool, and as having
brought me tidings of Sir Gilbert. He represented
that Sir Gilbert, seized with a sudden terror
through pecuniary difficulties, had fled to America&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Tis false! false as ever diabolical deceit could
be!” cried Trevelyan, emphatically. “I will stake
my existence that so far from being in any financial
embarrassment, Sir Gilbert Heathcote owes not a
farthing in the world, and does not live even up to
his income.”</p>

<p>“Your lordship takes too much upon yourself in
making such random statements,” said Green:
“since I am well assured of the exact truth of the
story I have told the lady.”</p>

<p>“This is a singular way for a man to express himself,
if he be an actual emissary from Sir Gilbert,”
observed Trevelyan. “You are well assured of the
exact truth of your story&mdash;are you? Then you
would have us infer that you had received it second-hand.
But pray continue, madam:&mdash;what else did
this fellow tell you? We shall unmask him altogether
presently&mdash;and perhaps his next move will be
from hence to the presence of a magistrate.”</p>

<p>Mr. Green endeavoured to assume as much composure
as he could possibly call to his aid: but he
did not at all admire the aspect that things were
taking&mdash;nor did he feel comfortable under the threat
so plainly held out.</p>

<p>“Oh! my lord, what a snare has been spread for
me!” exclaimed Mrs. Sefton, clasping her hands together
in profound thankfulness that she had escaped
the danger. “This bad man who now trembles
in your presence, would have induced me to accompany
him with the least possible delay to Liverpool,&mdash;thence
to embark by myself in order to rejoin Sir
Gilbert in New York. He has even about his person
the funds to bear the expenses of my voyage:&mdash;and
he would at once have hurried me away to
Liverpool,&mdash;only, in the first place, a vague suspicion
was excited in my mind,&mdash;and, secondly, I had particular&mdash;oh!
very particular reasons for remaining
in London at least a few hours longer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sefton suddenly checked herself: she was
being hurried away by her excited feelings into allusions
or positive revelations, on the verge of which
she thus stopped short. Trevelyan did not, however,
comprehend the motive of the abrupt pause which
she made, but attributed it to the influence of her
over-wrought emotions.</p>

<p>“Mr. Green&mdash;or whatever your real name may
be,” exclaimed the nobleman, turning round upon
the clerk, “what explanation can you give, sir, in
respect to all this?”</p>

<p>“I know not by what right you demand any explanation,
my lord,” said the man, determined to
put as good a face upon the matter as possible.</p>

<p>“I will tell you by what right,” returned the
patrician: “by the right which every man has to
protect and defend a lady against the machinations
of her enemies&mdash;by the right that every honest member
of society has to unmask a villain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you allude to me, my lord?” demanded
Green, rising from his seat.</p>

<p>“I do, sir,” replied Trevelyan. “You are a villain,
because you have lent yourself to an infamous
trick. You cannot have been imposed upon&mdash;inasmuch
as you have told many deliberate and wilful
falsehoods. You pretend to have arrived straight
from Liverpool, whereas you are undoubtedly a clerk
in the office of Mr. James Heathcote&mdash;for you
enacted the part of a clerk when I called there ere
now. You would have induced this lady to quit
London and repair to a foreign country, where
nothing but disappointment&mdash;perhaps beggary&mdash;would
have awaited her; and this act is so vile&mdash;so
atrocious&mdash;so horribly base, that I can scarcely control
my feelings&mdash;I can scarcely restrain my patience,
while I thus upbraid you with your infamy.
Were you a younger man, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the nobleman stopped short, ashamed of
wasting a menace upon one so unworthy of the
honest ire of a generous soul.</p>

<p>“Now that your lordship has lavished all your
abuse upon me, perhaps I may be permitted to depart,”
said Green, with much apparent coolness,
though in reality he was terribly alarmed.</p>

<p>“Not until you have explained the meaning of
this atrocious proceeding in which you have borne
so prominent a part,” replied Lord William. “Make
up your mind to answer my questions in a way that
shall carry truth upon the face of your words&mdash;or
prepare to give an account of your conduct to the
proper authority.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what would you have me do, my lord?”
asked the miserable wretch, now unable to conceal
his terror&mdash;unable also to subdue the trembling of
his limbs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<p>“Has foul play been adopted with regard to Sir
Gilbert Heathcote?” demanded Lord William,
speaking in a measured tone, and fixing his eyes
keenly upon the clerk.</p>

<p>“Good God! Does your lordship suspect that he
is murdered?” exclaimed Green, horrified at the bare
idea. “No&mdash;no: thank Heaven&mdash;it is not so bad as
that!”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven also!” murmured Mrs. Sefton,
her heart experiencing a relief so great and sudden&mdash;for
the man was evidently speaking the
truth&mdash;that she felt as if she were about to faint
through excessive joy.</p>

<p>“I scarcely apprehended such a frightful alternative
as my words may have seemed to imply,” said
Trevelyan. “But delay not, man&mdash;speak&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell
this afflicted lady also&mdash;where is Sir Gilbert
Heathcote?”</p>

<p>“My lord, I dare not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hesitate not another moment, sir,” cried the
nobleman, grasping the clerk violently by the collar
of his coat: “hesitate not, I say&mdash;or I will drag
you into the presence of the magistrate. Tell me&mdash;where
is my friend?&mdash;where is Sir Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“My lord&mdash;my lord”&mdash;stammered the affrighted
wretch, his countenance rendered hideous by its
workings.</p>

<p>“Speak&mdash;sir&mdash;I command you!” exclaimed Trevelyan,
in a tone of terrible excitement. “Trifle
not with me&mdash;or I shall do you a mischief. Where&mdash;where,
I ask for the last time, is Sir Gilbert
Heathcote?”</p>

<p>“In&mdash;&mdash;But you will kill me, my lord&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Speak, villain! Where is he?” demanded the
infuriate noble.</p>

<p>“In a mad-house!” was the reply, absolutely
wrung by terror from the clerk.</p>

<p>A piercing scream burst from the lips of Mrs.
Sefton&mdash;and in another moment she fell heavily
upon the carpet, with a dead sound as if it were a
corpse that had rolled from the sofa.</p>

<p>Trevelyan&mdash;stupified by the astounding words
that had fallen upon his ear&mdash;let go his hold on the
wretched clerk, on whom he stood gazing for a
few moments as if he had become petrified&mdash;turned
into a statue&mdash;paralysed&mdash;motionless. But suddenly
he seemed to be struck with the conviction
that Mrs. Sefton needed his assistance; and, forgetting
in the agitation and excitement of his feelings
to keep a watch upon the clerk, he hastened
to raise the prostrate lady from the floor.</p>

<p>He placed her upon the sofa, and sprinkled water
(of which there happened to be a decanter full on
the table) upon her countenance. In a few minutes
she opened her eyes, and gazed wildly around
her.</p>

<p>Trevelyan drew back a few paces so that the
air might circulate freely about her&mdash;when, suddenly
remembering the clerk, he looked hurriedly
round.</p>

<p>But the villain had stolen away!</p>

<p>At this moment a bitter groan burst from the
lips of Mrs. Sefton; for a remembrance of all that
had just occurred came rapidly to her mind&mdash;and
the horrible word “mad-house” seemed to echo in
her ears and touch a chord that vibrated with a
feeling of anguish to her very brain.</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands, while her
bosom heaved convulsively.</p>

<p>“Compose yourself, madam, I implore you,” said
Trevelyan. “Even this certainty which we have
acquired, is preferable to the suspense previously
endured.”</p>

<p>“But is there hope, my lord&mdash;is there any hope
left for <em>me</em>?” she inquired, removing her hands
from her countenance&mdash;now so pale&mdash;and gazing up
at the young patrician in a beseechful manner.</p>

<p>“Assuredly there <em>is</em> hope, my dear madam,” returned
Trevelyan, emphatically. “I am confident
that Sir Gilbert is in the possession of his intellects
as completely as ever, and that he is a <em>victim</em>&mdash;but
not a <em>maniac</em>. Indeed, I see through it all!”</p>

<p>“Oh! now you inspire me with hope!” exclaimed
Mrs. Sefton, taking his hand and pressing
it with fervent gratitude: and as her face was upturned
towards his own, it suddenly struck him,&mdash;struck
him like a flash of lightning,&mdash;that there was
in that countenance an expression reminding him of
Agnes Vernon,&mdash;although he had never beheld the
features of the Recluse of the Cottage otherwise
than tranquil, calm, and serene. Nevertheless, that
idea seized upon him: but in the next moment he
said to himself, “It is mere fancy!”&mdash;and as Mrs.
Sefton at that instant settled herself in such a
manner upon the sofa that her back became turned
to the window and the variation of light produced
a change in the expression of her countenance, that
idea was immediately absorbed in other and more
important considerations in the mind of the young
patrician.</p>

<p>“Oh! now you inspire me with hope!” Mrs.
Sefton had said; and her face brightened up&mdash;so
that it was at the moment when this sudden lustre
of joy was suffused upon her features, that the
above mentioned idea had struck the nobleman.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam&mdash;there is every reason to hope,” he
responded. “The entire plot, in all its terrible iniquity,
is now before me as clear as the noon-day
sun. I can read it as plainly as if it were in a book.
The brother is at the bottom of it all.”</p>

<p>“Did I not tell your lordship that he was a villain?”
asked Mrs. Sefton.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear madam,” replied Trevelyan: “but
I am slow to form injurious opinions of any man.
Now, however, I have the conviction of his turpitude&mdash;and
I hesitate no longer to proclaim him to be all
that you represented him.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;merciful heavens! while we are wasting
time in words,” exclaimed Mrs. Sefton, seized
with a sudden access of wild excitement, “Gilbert
is in a horrible predicament&mdash;and we should be
acting&mdash;not talking.”</p>

<p>“Haste and precipitation will effect no good in
this matter, my dear madam,” said Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“But we must find out the place where he is confined&mdash;we
must apply to the officers of justice&mdash;we
must release him!” cried the lady, her excitement
increasing.</p>

<p>“Pray, my dear madam, listen to me with some
degree of composure,” said the young nobleman;
“and I will explain to you how we must proceed,
and why nothing can be done with that speed which
would naturally be most consonant with your feelings.”</p>

<p>“I am composed&mdash;I am tranquil now, my dear
friend&mdash;for in such a light you will permit me to
consider you,” observed Mrs. Sefton, exercising as
strong a control over her emotions as she possibly
could command.</p>

<p>“In the first place I must tell you that I saw
Mr. James Heathcote this morning,” resumed Trevelyan
“and when I think of his cool villainy&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
unblushing effrontery&mdash;his matchless impudence, I
could tear my hair with rage at the idea of how I
was duped. For though I entered his office with a
strong suspicion&mdash;in spite of the remonstrance
which I last night made to you&mdash;I quitted his
presence with a very different impression.”</p>

<p>“And that man who was ere now with us, is his
clerk?” said Mrs. Sefton. “But what could be the
motive of their base attempt to induce me to quit
the country with such extraordinary precipitation?”</p>

<p>“The reason is apparent enough, my dear madam,”
answered Trevelyan; “and I will now explain to
you the whole matter, as I understand it. James
Heathcote has suborned two unprincipled villains,
calling themselves medical practitioners, to grant a
certificate of the insanity of his brother. The law
of England permits such a proceeding&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then the law of England is worthy only of barbarians!”
exclaimed the lady, emphatically.</p>

<p>“You are not the only person in the country who
entertains the same conviction,” observed Trevelyan,
with a smile: then, instantly resuming a serious
expression of countenance, he said, “By virtue of
that certificate, Sir Gilbert is suddenly seized upon
and carried off to a madhouse.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is horrible!” cried the lady, in a tone of
extreme bitterness mingled with anguish, while a
convulsive shudder passed over her from head to
foot.</p>

<p>“The iniquity is tremendous&mdash;and yet it is legal,”
said Lord William. “Yes&mdash;I blush for my country
when I declare such to be the fact,&mdash;I blush also for
my fellow-countrymen that they should tolerate a
system which savages themselves would regard with
abhorrence! Well, madam, the deed is done&mdash;the
atrocity is consummated&mdash;and Sir Gilbert Heathcote,
though in the complete enjoyment of his intellects,
is borne off to a lunatic-asylum. James&mdash;his
vile brother&mdash;will obtain the control over his
property; and that is the aim and object of his
wickedness. But knowing that you are interested&mdash;deeply
interested in Sir Gilbert’s welfare&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! heaven can witness how deeply!” exclaimed
the lady, clasping her hands with fervour.</p>

<p>“Knowing, I repeat, how profoundly you are interested
in all that concerns my valued friend,”
continued Trevelyan, “James Heathcote sought to
expatriate you at least for a season&mdash;so that he
might prevent you from adopting any measures to
restore the victim to the enjoyment of freedom.”</p>

<p>“But of what avail would a few weeks’ delay be,
even supposing that the plot devised against myself
had succeeded?” asked Mrs. Sefton. “If I had gone to
America, I should have found that Sir Gilbert was
not in New York&mdash;and I should have forthwith returned
to London. Unless, indeed,” she added, with
a shudder, “my heart had broken with the immensity
of its sorrow!”</p>

<p>“Ah! madam&mdash;and it was perhaps upon this
catastrophe that the vile man reckoned!” said Lord
William, his blood growing cold at the extent of the
turpitude which he was contemplating. “And yet
a more terrible suspicion still has come into my
mind&mdash;a suspicion so dreadful&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Name it! Keep me not in suspense!” cried the
lady, observing that her young friend was himself
becoming painfully excited now.</p>

<p>“During your absence, madam,” returned he, his
countenance darkening,&mdash;“during your absence, I
say&mdash;supposing that you had been induced to depart&mdash;sufficient
time would be gained to drive Sir
Gilbert mad in reality; and then, on your reappearance
in London, the lawyer would have defied
all that you could possibly attempt or devise!”</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven!” ejaculated the horror-stricken
woman; “can so much black iniquity exist in the
human breast?”</p>

<p>“Alas! such schemes as these are of frequent
occurrence in this land which vaunts a consummate
civilisation!” said Trevelyan. “Could we
but penetrate into the mysteries of the mad-house,
we should behold scenes that would make our hair
stand on end&mdash;our blood run cold in our veins&mdash;our
very souls sick! Yes, madam&mdash;too often, indeed,
is the lunatic asylum rendered the engine of
the most hideous cruelty: too often does it become
a prison for the <em>sane</em>!”</p>

<p>“You will drive me mad, my lord!” cried Mrs.
Sefton, dreadfully excited: “I shall myself become
an inmate&mdash;and deservedly so&mdash;of one of those awful
places!”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, dear madam&mdash;pardon me,” said
Trevelyan, deeply afflicted at having suffered his
excited feelings to hurry him into those passionate
exclamations which had so terrified her. “I was
wrong thus to dwell on the subject.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no: it is better that I should learn the
worst,” she cried, with a strong spasmodic shuddering,
while horror&mdash;ineffable horror&mdash;convulsed
her countenance. “But how shall we rescue him
from that living tomb?”</p>

<p>“Abandon not yourself to despair,” replied Trevelyan.
“In the first instance I must discover the
place where our friend is confined: and then, trust
to me to effect his deliverance!”</p>

<p>“Excellent man!&mdash;generous-hearted noble!”
cried Mrs. Sefton, in a tone indicative of the most
fervent gratitude. “But will not the law aid us in
all this?”</p>

<p>“I have already explained to you, my dear madam,
that every thing has doubtless been done by James
Heathcote under colour of the most monstrous law
that disgraces our statute-book,” responded Lord
William. “Were I to apply to a magistrate, I could
obtain no redress: he would be unable to assist
me. The Commissioners in Lunacy would view
the matter in the ordinary light, and tell me that
when the time for the usual periodical visit to the
various asylums arrived, due inquiries should be
instituted. No&mdash;the lawyer must be assailed by
other weapons: cunning must be met by cunning;&mdash;and
much as I abhor duplicity, I will not fail to
use it, if necessary, in this case. Believe me when
I assure you that no time shall be lost, and that I
will without delay adopt measures to discover the
place where our friend is imprisoned.”</p>

<p>“God send you success!” murmured Mrs. Sefton,
faintly: then, in a higher tone and with renewed
excitement, she said, “But how can I calm my feelings&mdash;how
can I tranquillize myself even for a
moment, while this state of suspense shall last?
And when I think of what <em>his</em> feelings must be&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
it is enough to drive him mad in reality where
he is, and me likewise mad here!”</p>

<p>“But you <em>must</em> endeavour to exercise some degree
of command over your emotions,” said Trevelyan.
“Consider&mdash;reflect&mdash;I may require your aid in this
work of deliverance; and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! now indeed you hold out an inducement
calculated to calm me&mdash;to give me courage!” exclaimed
Mrs. Sefton. “Yes&mdash;I <em>will</em> be tranquil: I
<em>will</em> exercise a greater control over my feelings. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
will throw aside the weakness of a woman, and become
strong in the hope of Sir Gilbert’s rescue, and
in the endeavour to accomplish it.”</p>

<p>“This frame of mind becomes you, my dear
madam,” said Trevelyan. “And now permit me to
take my departure&mdash;for there is no time to be lost.”</p>

<p>“Farewell for the present,” responded Mrs.
Sefton, offering him her hand; “and accept my
most unfeigned gratitude for your noble conduct towards
me and your generous intentions in behalf of
Sir Gilbert Heathcote.”</p>

<p>“You shall thank me when I have succeeded in
my endeavour to restore him to you,” said Trevelyan
pressing the lady’s hand with the cordiality of that
friendship which, short as their acquaintance had
been, circumstances had established and even cemented
between them.</p>

<p>He then hastened away from her dwelling, and
drove to his own house in Park Square.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXX">CHAPTER CLXX.<br />

<span class="medium">AGNES AND MRS. MORTIMER.</span></h2>

<p>In the meantime Mrs. Mortimer had not been
idle.</p>

<p>Possessed of the letter which had been entrusted
to her, she repaired in a hired vehicle to the immediate
vicinity of the cottage, and alighted in the lane
which was bounded on one side by the thick and
verdant hedge that enclosed the garden.</p>

<p>The old woman had not precisely made up her
mind how to proceed in the business which she had
taken in hand: she knew that the task was a difficult
one,&mdash;and she trusted rather to the chapter of
accidents than to any settled or preconceived project.</p>

<p>For she naturally reasoned within herself that
Mr. Vernon had doubtless warned his daughter not
to hold any further communication with strangers:
she had seen enough, on the evening of her visit to
the cottage, to enable her to judge that her presence
there was regarded suspiciously by that gentleman,
and that her tale was not believed by him;&mdash;and
she therefore calculated that Agnes had been duly
and impressively counselled not to receive her
again. Indeed, it was likewise probable that the
young lady might have been taught to look upon
her as a person having some evil object in view,
and that the servants had been charged to maintain
a strict watch upon her movements should she make
her appearance in that neighbourhood again.</p>

<p>All these reflections were duly weighed by Mrs.
Mortimer; and, under the circumstances which
they suggested, she found it to be totally impossible
to devise beforehand any particular method of carrying
out her aims.</p>

<p>She, however, more than hoped that, as the morning
was remarkably fine, with a warm summer sun
rendering the face of Nature bright and joyous,
Agnes would be certain to walk in her garden, if
not farther abroad. Nor was she mistaken in the
former portion of her expectation: for scarcely had
she reached the verdant boundary of the enclosure,
when she beheld, through the high hedge, the light
drapery of the young lady, who, clad in a morning-dress,
was advancing slowly along a gravel-walk,
with a book in her hand.</p>

<p>How beautiful did she appear, even to the gaze of
the old harridan who now surveyed her from behind
the hedge! There was an &aelig;sthetic grace in her
movements&mdash;an enchanting sweetness expressed in
her countenance&mdash;a gentle refinement in her bearing&mdash;and
a halo of innocence around her, which
rendered her a being with whom it was impossible
to associate ideas of sensuality, but whom the heart
might worship with the purest, holiest poetic sentiment,
as if hers were an ethereal nature.</p>

<p>Her eyes were bent upon the volume which she
held in her delicate, white hands; and her little
feet moved slowly along the gravel-walk&mdash;for she
was absorbed in the perusal of the book. She had
not fastened the white ribbons of the straw-bonnet
that she had evidently put on with a hasty negligence;
and those ribbons were thrown back over
her shoulders, thus allowing a shower of raven
curls to descend on each side of the fair face down
to the bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>Around that charming creature streamed the
flood of sun-light, making her tresses, dark though
they were, glitter like hyperions, and imparting a
dazzling whiteness to her drapery, which appeared
in strong relief amidst the luxuriant green of the
trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer was rejoiced when she beheld the
young lady in the garden&mdash;still more rejoiced when
she observed that Agnes was approaching that part
of the hedge behind which the harridan was concealed.</p>

<p>Several minutes however elapsed before the beauteous
creature was sufficiently nigh for Mrs. Mortimer
to address her; because she not only advanced
slowly, but stopped two or three times when she
met with a passage of more than ordinary interest
in the work she was reading. It was the novel of
“Ivanhoe” that thus rivetted her attention; and
she was in the midst of the exalting scene of the
combat between Brian de Bois-Gilbert and Wilfred
of Ivanhoe.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was startled by hearing her name
mentioned;&mdash;and she glanced around almost in
affright&mdash;but no one met her view.</p>

<p>“Miss Vernon&mdash;dear Miss Vernon,” repeated the
voice: “approach nearer to the hedge&mdash;’tis a
friend who thus addresses you.”</p>

<p>The maiden instantly recognised the peculiar tones
of the old woman who had called upon her nearly
a week previously; and, without giving any response,
she stood undecided how to act.</p>

<p>“Pray do not refuse to hear me&mdash;pray do not go
away, Miss Vernon,” resumed Mrs. Mortimer,
whose form the young lady could now distinguish
through the hedge. “I have something of importance
to communicate&mdash;and not for worlds would I
injure a hair of your head.”</p>

<p>“But I promised my father not to hold discourse
with any one who came not with a letter from him,”
said Agnes, at length breaking silence: “and moreover,”
she added, with some degree of hesitation,
“I am afraid that you do not mean any good
towards me.”</p>

<p>“Alas! Miss Vernon, can you entertain such
cruel suspicions regarding me?” cried Mrs. Mortimer,
as if deeply afflicted at the mistrust implied
in the maiden’s words. “Of what benefit would it
be for me to injure you? or, indeed, how could I
possibly injure you?”</p>

<p>“I know not&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! you hesitate, my dear young lady&mdash;and you
will accord me a hearing,” exclaimed the old woman,
eagerly. “In fact, I appeal to your sense of justice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
not to refuse me this opportunity of vindicating myself
against the suspicions which, I am well aware,
your father entertains concerning me. But, tell me&mdash;what
book is that which you hold in your hand?”
demanded Mrs. Mortimer, half-suspecting that it
might be a novel, and in that case hoping to find a
pretext for giving the conversation a turn towards
the topic of love.</p>

<p>“It is ‘Ivanhoe,’ madam,” said Agnes. “But
really I must not remain here any longer: I should
be sorry to suspect you&mdash;and yet my father&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dearest lady, not even your parent’s prejudices
should render <em>you</em> capable of an act of injustice,”
interrupted Mrs. Mortimer, with an emphasis that
made Agnes pause as she was on the point of retreating.
“You are engaged in the perusal of one
of the finest tales in the English language,” she continued,
abruptly diverting the conversation into
another channel: “and doubtless you have sighed
over the hopeless affection which the beautiful
Jewess cherished for him whose heart was given to
the Lady Rowena?”</p>

<p>“I have wept for the interesting and charming
Rebecca,” said Agnes, in the natural ingenuousness
of her character: “although I am well aware that
she is only the heroine of a romance, and I cannot
precisely understand wherefore she should have been
so much attached to Wilfrid.”</p>

<p>“The description is so life-like&mdash;is it not?” asked
Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“I know not&mdash;and yet it appears to me as if it
were all true&mdash;as if I could easily persuade myself
that such incidents really occurred, and such sentiments
could positively exist,” responded Agnes.
“But I must leave you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One word, Miss,” interrupted the old woman.
“You say that you could easily persuade yourself
that such sentiments as those experienced by Rebecca
for Wilfrid, and by Wilfrid and Rowena mutually,
could actually exist. Believe me, then, when
I assure you that although the incidents of that
tale are a fiction, the sentiments are the very reverse&mdash;and
that what the author denominates <em>love</em>
is a passion felt and acknowledged throughout the
universe.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;the love of a father towards his children,
and of children towards their parents,” said Agnes.
“Oh! I am well aware that such a blessed feeling
animates the mortal breast.”</p>

<p>“And there is another phase of that sentiment,”
resumed the old woman, immediately: “or rather,
the love which you described, is a <em>feeling</em>&mdash;whereas
the love which Rebecca experienced for Ivanhoe, is
a <em>passion</em>.”</p>

<p>“I cannot comprehend you, madam,” observed
Agnes, who gradually grew more and more interested
in this conversation, because Scott’s novel had
made a deep impression on her mind, and had raised
up a sentiment of curiosity which, through the very
ingenuousness of her disposition, sought for an
elucidation of those descriptions that were entirely
unintelligible or only dimly significant to
her.</p>

<p>“Suppose that Rebecca had addressed a letter to
Ivanhoe, explaining the sentiments which she entertained
towards him,” said the wily old woman:
“would not Wilfrid have been unkind&mdash;ungenerous&mdash;even
harsh and brutal, not to have perused that
narrative of her feelings?”</p>

<p>“But his character <em>was</em> generous,” exclaimed
Agnes, emphatically; “and he would not have refused
to read such a letter.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” continued Mrs. Mortimer. “And
now, my sweet young lady, let us suppose that it
was Wilfrid who experienced an attachment for
Rebecca, and that Rebecca suspected it not;&mdash;and
suppose, likewise, that Wilfrid penned a letter, in
respectful and proper language to the Jewess, describing
the sentiments that animated him&mdash;what
course should the beautiful Israelite have pursued?”</p>

<p>“She would have proved as generous on her side
as we have already agreed that Wilfrid of Ivanhoe
would have been generous on his part,” answered
Agnes, without an instant’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Such is your opinion, sweet maiden?” cried
Mrs. Mortimer, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“I have no reason to think otherwise,” was the
immediate response.</p>

<p>“Then, Miss Vernon,” said the old woman, in a
tone of mingled triumph and solemnity, “I implore
you to peruse the letter of which I am the
bearer, and which is intended for you&mdash;and for you
alone!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Mrs. Mortimer thrust Trevelyan’s
missive through the hedge; and Agnes received it
mechanically, though startled and bewildered by so
sudden and unexpected a proceeding.</p>

<p>“Read it, Miss Vernon&mdash;read it,” cried the old
woman: “there is nothing in its contents to offend
you&mdash;but perhaps much to please and delight.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, the young maiden&mdash;innocent, artless,
and unsophisticated as she was&mdash;hesitated no
longer, but, opening the letter, commenced its
perusal.</p>

<p>The first paragraph, as the reader will remember,
ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Pardon a stranger who dares to address you, beautiful
Miss Vernon, in a strain that might give you offence, were he
not sincere in his language and honourable in his intentions:&mdash;pardon
me, I implore you&mdash;and refuse not to read those few
lines to the end! He who thus writes is the individual that
you have observed occasionally in the vicinity of your dwelling;
and you will perceive by the signature to this letter
that he is not a man without ostensible guarantees for his
social position. That his character is unimpeachable he can
proudly declare; and that he will not address to you, Miss
Vernon, a single word which he will fear to repeat in your
father’s presence, he solemnly declares.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At first the maiden’s countenance wore an expression
of profound astonishment when she found
herself addressed by a person who avowed himself
to be “a stranger,” and who proceeded to speak of
sincerity of language and honourable intentions.
What intentions, then, had he? This was the
thought that flashed to her mind. In the next
moment she discovered that the letter came from
the gentleman whom she <em>had</em> observed, on more
occasions than one, in the neighbourhood of the
cottage; and now it struck her, as if with a ray of
light darting into her soul, that he must have had
some object, beyond that of a mere lounge,
in so frequently loitering about the precincts
of the garden. Something&mdash;a something that was
nevertheless incomprehensible&mdash;told her that she
ought to read no more; but at that instant the
concluding words of the paragraph above quoted met
her eyes&mdash;and she murmured to herself, “There
can be no harm in perusing the words that he would
speak to me in my father’s presence.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>She accordingly read on, until she came to the
termination of the next paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Let me, however, speak of myself in the first person
again: let me assure you that your beauty has captivated my
heart&mdash;and that, if any thing were wanting to render me your
slave, the description which the bearer of this letter has given
me of your amiable qualities, would be more than sufficient.
I am rich&mdash;and therefore I have no selfish motive in addressing
you, even if you be rich also: but I would rather
that it were otherwise with you, so that my present proceeding
may appear to you the more disinterested. Had I any
means of obtaining an introduction to you, beautiful Miss
Vernon, I should not have adopted a measure that gives me
pain because I tremble lest it should wound or offend you.
But mine is an honest&mdash;a sincere&mdash;and a devoted attachment;
and I shall be happy indeed if you will permit me to open a
correspondence with your father on the subject. Were he to
honour me with a visit, I should be proud to receive him.
But if, in the meantime, you seek to know more of me&mdash;if I
might venture to solicit you to accord me an interview of
only a few minutes, you cannot divine how fervently I should
thank you&mdash;how delighted I should feel! Let this interview
take place in the presence of Mrs. Mortimer, if you will: I
have nothing to communicate to you that I should hesitate
to say before your father or your friends. Oh! how can I
convince you of my sincerity?&mdash;how can I testify my devotion?&mdash;how
can I prove the extent of my love?”</p></blockquote>

<p>While she perused this portion of the letter, the
following thoughts and ideas ran rapidly through
her mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My beauty has captivated his heart&mdash;&mdash;Oh! then
he believes me to be beautiful! Mrs. Mortimer has
spoken well of me to him: in this case, she cannot
be a bad woman, and she cannot mean me any harm.
Assuredly my dear papa was wrong to suspect her.
He has no selfish motive in addressing me&mdash;even if
I be rich: then, whatever his intentions be, they
must be honourable, as he says&mdash;because all wickedness
is undertaken for the sake of gold. He is
afraid of offending me. Oh! how can I be offended
with one who addresses me in such a respectful
manner, and who seems to fear that the simple fact
of thus writing to me will excite my anger? ‘<em>A
sincere and a devoted attachment!</em>’ Ah! such was
the attachment that Rebecca entertained for Wilfrid,
and that Wilfrid experienced for Rowena;&mdash;and
now I perceive something different between
<em>their</em> attachment and that which the Templar harboured
towards the beautiful Jewess. He wishes to
see my father&mdash;he wishes to obtain an interview with
me!”&mdash;And the maiden’s heart began to palpitate,
she knew not why: but at this moment it struck
her that the writer of the letter was of agreeable
person, and that he must be what the author of
“Ivanhoe” would have denominated <em>handsome</em>.
With a gradually increasing fluttering in her bosom,
the artless maiden read on&mdash;until she suddenly
found the paragraph close with the mystic name of
<em>love</em>!</p>

<p>Then a gentle flush appeared upon her damask
cheek; and a veil rapidly fell from her eyes. She
now comprehended how it was possible for Rebecca
to be attached to Wilfrid of Ivanhoe:&mdash;Agnes had
already learnt by heart the alphabet of love! At
the same time, her soul retained all its chaste purity,
though it lost a trifle of its girlish artlessness:&mdash;love
began to be comprehensible to her as a refined
and poetic sentiment&mdash;and not as a less divine
passion or earthly sensuousness. A dreamy and
unknown joy was stealing into her bosom&mdash;as if
she had just been blessed with a glimpse of the
realms of ethereal bliss;&mdash;and, under the influence
of these feelings, she read the letter on to its
close:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I beseech you to reflect, Miss Vernon, that my happiness
depends upon your reply. Am I guilty of an indiscretion in
loving you? Love is a passion beyond mortal control!
He who knows no other deity, deserves not blame for worshipping
the sun, because it is glorious and bright; and my
heart, which knows no other idol, adores you, because you
are beautiful and good. Treat not my conduct, then, with
anger: let not your pride be offended by the proceeding
which I have adopted in order to make my sentiments
known to you;&mdash;and scorn not the honest&mdash;the pure&mdash;the
ardent affection which an honourable man dares to proffer
you. I do not merit punishment because I love you;&mdash;and
your silence would prove a punishment severe and undeserved
indeed! Again, I conjure you to remember that the
happiness of a fellow-creature depends upon you: your decision
will either inspire me with the most joyous hope, or
plunge me into the deepest despair. At the same time,
beauteous Agnes,&mdash;(the words&mdash;those delightful words,
‘<em>beauteous Agnes</em>,’ are written now, and I cannot&mdash;will not
erase them)&mdash;at the same time, I say, if your affections be
already engaged&mdash;if a mortal more blest than myself have
received the promise of your hand, accept the assurance,
sweet maiden, that never more shall you be molested by me&mdash;never
again will I intrude myself upon your attention.
For with my love is united the most profound respect; and
not for worlds would I do aught to excite an angry feeling
in your soul.</p>

“Your ardent admirer and devoted friend,<br />
“WILLIAM TREVELYAN.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>While she perused this last paragraph in the
letter, Agnes more than once felt an involuntary
sigh stealing from her bosom&mdash;as if it were called
up by a strain of music familiar to her childhood,
and reviving many pleasing reflections.</p>

<p>The last portion of the letter became clearly
intelligible to her, in consequence of the suggestive
incidents which she had been reading in
Scott’s novel. For would not Rebecca have received
Wilfrid’s hand, had his love not been already
plighted to Rowena? It was evident, then, that
William Trevelyan sought her&mdash;yes, <em>her</em>&mdash;Agnes
Vernon&mdash;as his wife; and that he feared lest she
should be engaged to wed another! Oh! now she
comprehended the full intent&mdash;the full meaning
of that letter which he had addressed to her: she
perceived that he loved her&mdash;that he had loitered
about the cottage in order to behold her&mdash;that
he wrote to her, because he feared to offend by
accosting her&mdash;and that he dreaded no refusal on
the part of her father, provided that she was not
already pledged to become the wife of another
suitor!</p>

<p>“You have read the letter, my child?” asked
the old woman, who, even through the verdant
foliage of the hedge, had watched every change in
the expression of the maiden’s countenance, and
had thereby obtained a complete insight into what
was passing in her mind.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” murmured Agnes, in a tone that
was scarcely audible&mdash;for she now felt embarrassed,
bashful, and timid, she knew not wherefore.</p>

<p>“And you are not offended with Lord William
Trevelyan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lord William Trevelyan!” exclaimed the beauteous
girl, now seized with surprise: “is he indeed
a nobleman? Oh! I am sorry for that!” she
added, giving vent in her artlessness to an expression
which confirmed the old woman’s already existing
suspicion that her employer was by no means
indifferent to the Recluse of the Cottage.</p>

<p>“You are sorry that he is a nobleman, my sweet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
child?” said Mrs. Mortimer. “Are you afraid that
he is too proud to make a humble maiden his
wife?”</p>

<p>Agnes blushed deeply, and remained silent.</p>

<p>“Fear nothing on that head,” continued the old
woman. “He is no deceiver: his intentions are
honourable. And now tell me frankly and candidly&mdash;has
his letter displeased you?”</p>

<p>“I should be deceiving you were I to answer in
the affirmative,” responded Agnes; “and yet I feel&mdash;at
least, it seems as if I feel that I ought to be
displeased, although I cannot in truth declare that
I am. But I will send this letter to my dear father,
who is in Paris&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! Mr. Vernon is in France,” interrupted Mrs.
Mortimer, delighted to find the way thus cleared
for the furtherance of the projects which she had in
hand; for she was resolved to make herself particularly
useful to Lord William in his suit with
the beautiful Agnes, so that her claims upon him
might be all the more considerable. “However,
my dear child,” she continued, “you would do well
not to trouble your father at present, since he is
doubtless engaged in particular business on the
Continent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! my father will be delighted to find that I
communicate to him everything that occurs,” interrupted
Agnes; “and since Lord William Trevelyan
so especially alludes to my dear parent in his
letter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Miss Vernon&mdash;Miss Vernon,” exclaimed the old
woman, impatiently, “this is a matter of so much
delicacy, that I must implore you to be guided by
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Would you counsel me not to forward this
letter to my father?” asked the maiden, in a tone
so low and tremulous that it afforded no aid to the
reading of the thoughts that dictated the question.</p>

<p>“Such is the advice that I should assuredly give
you, my dear child&mdash;at least for the present,” was
the response.</p>

<p>“And do you think,” continued Agnes, in a tone
still lower and still more tremulous than before,&mdash;“do
you think that Lord William Trevelyan would
proffer me the same counsel?”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it, sweet maiden,” hastily
replied Mrs. Mortimer. “For <em>his</em> sake&mdash;for <em>your</em>
sake it were best that none save myself should
become acquainted with the secret of your
love&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! madam,” exclaimed Agnes, in a voice of
touching remonstrance and pathetic reproach, “if
this love of which you speak be a feeling that
must alienate me from the sympathies of my
father, and compel me to cherish a secret that I
dare not impart to him, I can have no hope that
happiness will be the result! Farewell, madam;
restore the letter to him who honoured me by
addressing me in those terms that for an instant
dazzled and bewildered me&mdash;and tell him that it
were better for him to think no more of Agnes
Vernon!”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the maiden tossed the
letter hastily, but not insultingly, over the hedge,
and hurried away towards the cottage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer was for a few minutes stupified
by this decisive and most unexpected proceeding.
She had imagined that Agnes had become a complete
dupe to the specious arguments she had used
to ensnare her; and she was astounded to find
that fair creature, so innocent and artless asserting
an energy of volition which was inspired by
the purest sentiments of rectitude, and which
dominated over the nascent feelings of affection
evidently engendered in her bosom by the suit of
Lord William Trevelyan.</p>

<p>The old woman knew not how to act. She perceived
that it was useless to endeavour to obtain
another interview with Agnes&mdash;at least on
the present occasion; and she was unwilling
to return to her employer with the acknowledgment
that her policy had rather marred than
forwarded his interests. She therefore now began
to reflect whether it were not better to abandon the
business altogether, and return to Paris, where
her daughter’s affairs might afford scope for her
intriguing qualifications and likewise augment
her pecuniary resources. She was already possessed
of between five and six thousand pounds&mdash;the
amount wrung from the hands of her miserable
husband; and she came to the conclusion that it
was scarcely worth her while to waste any more
time in a matter which, even were she successful,
would only bring her a recompense of a few
hundreds.</p>

<p>Having made these hasty reflections, Mrs. Mortimer
thrust Trevelyan’s letter into her reticule,&mdash;for
she never destroyed documents that related to private
affairs; and, returning to the hackney-coach,
desired to be driven to the Borough.</p>

<p>She alighted in Blackman Street, and, having
dismissed the vehicle, repaired to the coffee-house
where she had taken up her abode.</p>

<p>As she was passing by the bar-parlour, in order
to reach the staircase leading to her own chamber,
the mistress of the establishment came forth and
beckoned her into the room: then, closing the door,
the woman said, in a tone savouring somewhat of
cool insolence, “I tell you what it is, Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;the
sooner you accommodate yourself with
other lodgings, the better: ’cos, though I ain’t over
partickler and makes no imperent inquiries about
them as paytronises my house&mdash;yet, for all that, I
can’t abide such wisitors as come on your account
just now. Leastways, I’d rayther be vithout ’em.”</p>

<p>“My good woman!” exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer,
surveying the landlady with an astonishment the
most real and unfeigned, “you must be labouring
under some mistake. I hope that I’m a respectable
person; and I am sure that I shall bring no discredit
on your house. As for any visitors who have
called on my account, I expect none&mdash;and therefore
there is an error in the matter.”</p>

<p>“No such a thing!” cried the landlady, her
choler rising. “There was two men which come
just now: and, what’s more, they was officers with
a search-warrant&mdash;and I couldn’t perwent them
from doing their dooty.”</p>

<p>“Officers!&mdash;a search-warrant!” ejaculated Mrs.
Mortimer, now becoming frightened&mdash;although she
could not conceive what feature of her recent conduct
could have excited any suspicion on the part
of the myrmidons of justice:&mdash;but suddenly a fear
of an appalling nature seized upon her&mdash;for her
money was all concealed in her chamber up-stairs.
“Oh! it’s wery well on your part, ma’am, to put
a good face on the bisness,” said the landlady: “but
it’s nevertheless true for all that. A great tall
hulking feller and a seedy-looking old man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“An old man!” repeated Mrs. Mortimer, now
becoming sick at heart.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;an old man,” proceeded the coffee-house-keeper’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
wife; “and he said he was a officer
with a search-warrant, and that t’other was his
assistant&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<div id="i_257" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_257.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“’Tis a trick&mdash;a vile trick! I see it all&mdash;I understand
it now!” cried the wretched Mrs. Mortimer,
staggering towards a chair and gasping for breath:&mdash;but
in a few moments she seemed to be endowed
with a sudden energy, and, bursting from the room,
she rushed up-stairs to her own chamber&mdash;the landlady,
who was a stout and therefore less active woman,
following as quickly as she could.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer entered her room, and darted towards
her trunk. The lid resisted not her attempt
to raise it&mdash;for the lock had been forced. She
plunged her hand amidst the clothes that the box
contained, and felt for <em>something</em> underneath:&mdash;but
the object of her anxious&mdash;her desperate search, was
not there;&mdash;and, with a groan as it were of mortal
agony, she sank upon the floor.</p>

<p>The landlady, who entered the room at this moment,
and who was not naturally a bad-hearted
being, hastened to raise the miserable woman. She
placed her on a chair, and tore off, rather than
quietly removed, her bonnet and shawl: but Mrs.
Mortimer’s jaw fell&mdash;her countenance was ghastly
pale&mdash;she seemed to be dying.</p>

<p>On water being sprinkled on her face, she came
to herself; and the landlady said, “What is the
matter with you? I can’t understand the meaning
of all this.”</p>

<p>“I have been robbed&mdash;foully robbed,” returned
Mrs. Mortimer, in a hoarse and hollow tone: but
she did not reflect that, no matter how her husband
had obtained his money, she had played the part of
a foul robber or extortioner towards <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>“Robbed!&mdash;what do you mean?” cried the landlady.
“Wasn’t them real officers as come just
now?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;a thousand times <em>no</em>,” ejaculated the old
woman, growing infuriate as her energies revived.
“It was a base plot&mdash;a vile design:&mdash;but I will be
avenged&mdash;terribly avenged! He must have found
someone to advise him&mdash;some one to assist him in all
this! They watched me&mdash;they marked when I went
out&mdash;and, under pretence of being officers, they succeeded
in searching my box&mdash;and, what is worse,”
she added, with a demoniac contortion of the countenance,&mdash;“they
succeeded in robbing me!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>“Was it the old man who did this?” asked the
landlady.</p>

<p>“Yes: that ancient villain, with the pale face,”
was the reply. “But tell me&mdash;was not his countenance
pale and wrinkled?&mdash;and did he not seem
nervously excited while speaking to you?”</p>

<p>“Just so,” answered the landlady.</p>

<p>“Ah! I thought that I was not mistaken!” exclaimed
Mrs. Mortimer, in a tone that indicated a
concentration of the most ferocious rage and diabolical
hate in her savage breast. “But leave me now&mdash;I
must be alone for a short time&mdash;I must ponder
upon all this, and determine how to act. I am not
altogether without friends&mdash;nor yet without resources.”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am,” said the landlady, “I hope you
won’t think no more of what I told you just now&mdash;I
mean, about leaving the place. Since those fellers
wasn’t officers, and you ain’t a suspicious person,
I’m sure I don’t want to get rid of you.”</p>

<p>“I shall not leave you quite yet, my good woman,”
responded Mrs. Mortimer; “and I am not angry on
account of what you said just now. But pray let
me be alone for the present.”</p>

<p>The landlady withdrew in obedience to this request;
and Mrs. Mortimer sate down upon the bed
to ruminate on the misfortune that had produced so
sudden and deplorable a change in her position.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had she brought her mind to
reflect with some degree of calmness on the situation
of her affairs, when she heard heavy and hasty
footsteps ascending the staircase.</p>

<p>Dreading lest some new calamity were about to
overtake her, she started to her feet in trepidation
and nervous excitement: nor was she reassured
when the door was unceremoniously opened, and a
man of most repulsive appearance bounced into the
chamber.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXI">CHAPTER CLXXI.<br />

<span class="medium">JACK RILY, THE DOCTOR.</span></h2>

<p>The individual who thus intruded himself upon
the presence of the affrighted woman, was about
forty years of age&mdash;of middle height&mdash;somewhat
stout&mdash;and of powerful form. He was not corpulent;
but his build denoted immense strength,&mdash;his
shoulders being broad and massive, and his limbs of
large proportions. His neck was short and thick, like
that of a bull; and his huge hands, when clenched,
appeared as if they could fell an ox or batter down
a wall.</p>

<p>His countenance was perfectly hideous. It was
of dark complexion; and on the right cheek was a
large scar of livid red, as if the flesh had been seared
with a hot iron and left to heal without any surgical
assistance. The low but broad forehead was overshadowed
with coarse, black, matted hair, which
the man wore long, and which he evidently much
neglected&mdash;so that it had a dirty appearance, in
spite of its jetty hue. His eyes were small and
dark; and the whites&mdash;for we know not what other
name to give them&mdash;were of a yellow hue,&mdash;so that
an ominous fire seemed to animate those eyes, as if
they reflected all the bad passions of a polluted
soul. The nose, which was large, thick, and coarse,
projected all on one side, and had enormous nostrils.
Add to all these elements of ugliness a hare-lip,
with an opening so large that it displayed two of the
man’s large white teeth up to the very gum, and the
reader may form a tolerably accurate idea of the repulsive
aspect of this individual.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a greasy velveteen shooting-jacket,
a rusty black waistcoat, corduroy trowsers,
and heavy high-lows; a blue cotton handkerchief
was negligently tied round his neck;&mdash;and his shirt,
which was none of the cleanest, was open in front,
the buttons being deficient&mdash;so that a portion of his
hirsute chest was visible. On his head he wore an
old fur cap of a tawny colour, but sadly stained
with grease, as if it were tossed in any dirty nook or
corner when not in use.</p>

<p>As the man had no whiskers, and his complexion
was so dark, it might have been supposed that he
had some African blood in his veins. Such was not,
however, the case;&mdash;he was born in England and of
English parents&mdash;aye, and had received an English
education likewise. But nature had given him a
hideous aspect; and circumstances had imbued his
soul with the ferocity of a hyena and the subtlety of
a serpent.</p>

<p>It is not often that the savage disposition is characterised
by a profound and latent cunning&mdash;because
the violence of furious passions usually
absorbs all reflection in its sudden impulses and
outbursts. But this man was ferocious by nature,
and subtle in consequence of possessing a powerful
intellect and having received a good education.
Not that intelligence and mental cultivation engender
craft and cunning: no&mdash;but they teach the
necessity of consideration and forethought;&mdash;and
the result, in respect to the individual whom we
are describing, was that he knew the world so well
as to be fully aware that intrigue and machination
frequently succeeded where brute force could accomplish
nothing.</p>

<p>Thus, when there was no need to have recourse
to artifice, this man appeared as a very demon let
loose upon society: but when cunning could gain
an end, he was enabled to control his savage propensities
and exercise a complete domination over
his ferocious instincts.</p>

<p>Such was the person who burst upon the view of
the terrified Mrs. Mortimer in the abrupt manner
already described.</p>

<p>She had risen from her seat on the bed, and now
stood gazing on him in speechless apprehension and
amazement: but he, not heeding the alarm which
his presence inspired, closed the door carefully
behind him, and then, throwing his greasy cap on a
chair, approached the old woman, saying, “So I
understand you have been robbed, ma’am? Well&mdash;don’t
give way to despair: I think I can help you
to the recovery of your money.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Mrs. Mortimer, considerably
relieved by the hope thus abruptly held out, and
at the same moment animated by the conviction
that the man could not mean her any harm&mdash;as she
had never seen him before in her life; and, moreover,
the house was neither deserted nor lonely,
and it was now the broad noon-day,&mdash;under which
circumstances crimes of violence were seldom
perpetrated.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I think I can help you,” repeated the
man. “But there is plenty of time before us&mdash;and
we must have a chat over the matter in the first
instance.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he seated himself in a free and
easy fashion; and Mrs. Mortimer likewise took a
chair&mdash;for she had now become deeply interested in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
the present visit, despite the revolting ugliness of
the visitor.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she asked: “and in what manner
do you think you can aid me?”</p>

<p>“One question at a time, my dear madam,” returned
the fellow, with cool familiarity. “First
then, as to who I am. My name is Rily&mdash;Mr. Rily
amongst mere acquaintances&mdash;John Rily in a
police-sheet&mdash;and Jack Rily amongst intimate
friends. But those who know me best call me <em>the
Doctor</em>, because, you see, I was brought up to the
medical profession. That was against my tastes,
and only in obedience to the wishes of my parents;
and so, as soon as they hopped the twig&mdash;which was
when I was about two-and-twenty&mdash;I gave up
mending broken legs, and took to breaking into
houses. Instead of feeling pulses, I fingered purses&mdash;and
found the new profession more profitable.
Such a hand as this,” he continued, with a horrible
grin, as he extended his broad and horny palm,
“was rather intended to wield a crow-bar than a
lancet, or grasp a pistol in preference to a scalpel.
Now, my dear ma’am, I think you may begin to suspect
who and what I am.”</p>

<p>“A burglar and a thief,” said Mrs. Mortimer, who
had by this time recovered all her wonted calmness.
“Well&mdash;you are the more likely to aid me in my
present embarrassment&mdash;I mean, in the recovery of
my money: and, of course, you can dictate your
own terms.”</p>

<p>“I am perfectly assured of <em>that</em>,” responded the
Doctor, again grinning maliciously with his horrid
hare-lip, which seemed as if it were about to split
completely up his cheek. “But, at that same time,
I admit with all possible candour that I cannot act
alone in this business: and therefore you have that
guarantee for my good faith.”</p>

<p>“But in what way do you propose to act?” demanded
Mrs. Mortimer, anxious to arrive at a more
satisfactory understanding with her hideous visitor.</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” answered Rily. “I am not
known at this coffee-house; and therefore I came
in just now to take some refreshment and read the
paper. I saw you enter, and thought that yours was a
countenance which denoted a soul alive to mischief.
That was the impression you made upon me; for I
must tell you that I am a bit of a phrenologist in
my way. However, I had almost ceased to think
of you, when I saw you come rushing out of the
bar-parlour and bolt up-stairs like a mad woman.
Then I marked your countenance again&mdash;and I was
seized with admiration towards you on account of
the horrible expression of your features. I said to
myself that if ever I had beheld a she-fiend, I had
seen one then.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you for the compliment,”
observed Mrs. Mortimer, drily.</p>

<p>“Let me tell my story in my own way, my dear
madam,” exclaimed Jack Rily, with mock politeness.
“Well, I saw you bolt up-stairs, and the
landlady after you; and I knew that there must
be something queer in the wind. So I waited
quietly reading the paper until the landlady came
down again; and then I went to the bar to pay my
money. A question or two that I put elicited the
information that you had been robbed by two fellows
pretending to be officers having a search-warrant;
and the landlady, in her garrulity, gave
me a description of those individuals. One of them&mdash;the
old man&mdash;I know nothing of: he is a complete
stranger to me;&mdash;but the other I do know,&mdash;and
what is more, I owe him a grudge&mdash;it matters
not why or for what. I thereupon told the landlady
that I thought I could help you in the matter;
and before she had time to make any answer, I
rushed up to your room to introduce myself to your
notice.”</p>

<p>“Now I begin to understand you, Mr. Rily,” said
the old woman. “You are acquainted with one of
the robbers&mdash;you probably know his haunts&mdash;and
you have a spite to vent upon him. Is this it?”</p>

<p>“Just so,” answered the burglar. “You must
also learn that the reading which I had of your
countenance convinced me that I might with safety
tell you who and what I am: because I never have
any child’s play in the business I am engaged in. If
you want to get back your money, you must put
confidence in me and act as I tell you; and the
only way to make you trust me, is to let you know
my real character. You see in me, then, a cracksman
and a prig: but I am stanch to the back-bone
amongst pals.”</p>

<p>“And on what terms do you propose to aid me?”
demanded Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“How much have these fellows robbed you of?”
asked Rily.</p>

<p>The old woman hesitated for a few moments:
she knew not whether it were prudent to tell the
truth to her new friend, who so deliberately announced
himself as a gentleman exercising a profession
which could not possibly be characterised
by any particular scruples or punctilios.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;just as you like, ma’am,” said Jack, rising
from his seat. “By declaring on to the swag,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
I may get my reglars<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> from the two prigs, whom I
can easily trace out; and therefore, if you are afraid
to trust me, I shall be off at once. In this case,
mind, you will never see a penny of the money you
have lost.”</p>

<p>“Stay, Mr. Rily&mdash;stay!” exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer,
who perfectly comprehended the man’s meaning,
which was to the effect that he <em>might</em> obtain
some of the booty for himself without her co-operation;
whereas she could not recover a shilling
unless assisted by him.</p>

<p>The burglar coolly reseated himself.</p>

<p>“You asked me of how much I was robbed?”
she said, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the laconic response.</p>

<p>“Five thousand four hundred pounds,” observed
Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“My stars! is it possible?” exclaimed Rily, his
horrible countenance expanding with delight.</p>

<p>“It is the truth, I can assure you,” rejoined the
old woman.</p>

<p>“Five thousand four hundred pounds,” repeated
the burglar, in a slow and measured tone, as if to
prolong the enjoyment of the sweet music which
the mention of such a sum made for his auricular
sense.</p>

<p>“It is a serious loss&mdash;is it not?” asked Mrs. Mortimer,
anxiously watching his countenance, its
expression denoting hope&mdash;nay, even indicating a
certainty of success in the endeavour to recover the
amount: but that same tablet of the mind gave no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
assurance that the man would act honourably towards
her in the end, and content himself only with
a share.</p>

<p>“Five thousand four hundred pounds!” he again
repeated, in a musing tone. “Yes&mdash;’tis a serious
loss! The recovery, however, would be two thousand
seven hundred a-piece: would that suit you?”
he demanded, turning abruptly towards her.</p>

<p>“What?” she said, affecting not to comprehend
the question.</p>

<p>“Will you agree to give me one half of the sum, if
I recover the whole?” asked Rily. “That is plain
English, I believe&mdash;and now it depends on you whether
our conversation shall be prolonged or not.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I will cheerfully give you one half,” returned
Mrs. Mortimer, making up her mind to keep
to the bargain only in the case of her inability to
depart from it with safety to herself.</p>

<p>“Well and good,” resumed Rily. “I must now
inform you that the tall fellow who was with the
old man is one of the most noted cracksmen in London&mdash;a
desperate ruffian, who would think no more
of shooting a person through the head than of eating
his dinner. What his real name is, I don’t know&mdash;I
never heard&mdash;although he and I have been acquainted
for years past: but he is called <em>Vitriol
Bob</em>, from a little peculiarity which he has introduced
into <em>his</em> professional mode of doing business.”</p>

<p>“I do not catch your meaning,” said Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;though
not without a shudder; for she <em>did</em>
entertain a vague suspicion of the frightful origin
of that singular pseudonym.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain myself more fully, ma’am,” returned
the Doctor, “since we have all the day before us,
and may chatter a bit to while away the time. You
see that the individual of whom we are speaking,
has an awkward knack of lurking about in bye-streets
and secluded neighbourhoods, to way-lay
gentlemen who happen to have gold chains hanging
over their waistcoats or out of their fobs: for those
little articles are pretty faithful evidences that the
purses of such folks are not entirely empty. Well,
in case of a struggle, our friend is apt to break a
phial of vitriol over the face of his opponent, so that
he may get away, and also that the said opponent
may be blinded, and unable to identify him on any
future occasion. Hence his name of <em>Vitriol Bob</em>;
and such is the terror he has inspired throughout
the districts of Kennington, Camberwell, Peckham,
and thereabouts, that the moment any gentleman
returning home from a party or from the tavern
hears the ominous sound of ‘<em>Your money or your
eyes</em>,’ he exclaims, ‘<em>Don’t throw the vitriol, and I’ll
give up everything</em>.’”</p>

<p>“Is this possible?” cried Mrs. Mortimer, with a
shudder that was colder and more perceptible than
the former one.</p>

<p>“Oh! quite possible, ma’am, I can assure you,”
said the Doctor, calmly. “You shall see Vitriol
Bob to-night&mdash;and then judge for yourself whether
he looks like a fellow who could do such a thing, or
not. A more hang-dog countenance you never saw
in your life. I know that I am not particularly
handsome,” he added with a horrible grin and leer:
“but I don’t look quite such a bravo as he does.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer thought that if Vitriol Bob were
more hideous in outward appearance than Jack
Rily, he must be frightful indeed.</p>

<p>“This is the chap we shall have to deal with to-night,”
continued the burglar; “and therefore, as
you perceive, we must go well prepared to play the
game properly. Who his companion is in the robbery,
I can’t make out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I know,” interrupted Mrs. Mortimer,
hastily: “he is a poor&mdash;weak&mdash;emaciated&mdash;nervous
old man, whom I will undertake to subdue and
even bind with cords in a few moments. Oh! he
shall find me a very tiger-cat let loose upon him!”
she added, her countenance suddenly expressing a
hyena-like ferocity.</p>

<p>“Now you do seem handsome&mdash;royally handsome&mdash;although
in reality you are so infernally
ugly!” exclaimed Jack Rily. “That is the way in
which I like to see a woman look. Why&mdash;perdition
seize me! but I could almost love you. What
a splendid couple we should make!”</p>

<p>And the idea tickled the wretch’s fancy to such
an extent, that he laughed until the tears streamed
from his yellow eyes, and ran down his dark countenance,
while his hare-lip opened so wide that all
his upper teeth&mdash;large, perfect, white, and even&mdash;were
displayed to the gums.</p>

<p>“Cease this disgusting mirth, sir,” exclaimed
Mrs. Mortimer, unable to restrain her feelings:
for&mdash;ugly, criminal, and morally degraded as she
knew herself to be&mdash;the observations of the monster
and his consequent hilarity outraged her cruelly.</p>

<p>“Come&mdash;come; we must not be bad friends,”
said Jack Rily, extending his huge palm towards
the old woman, who proffered her hand in return
through fear of offending the wretch that had
become too useful for her to lose him until the
contemplated business should have been accomplished.
“There&mdash;that’s right,” he added, as he
shook her hand with a violence that made her
wince: “now there is no ill-feeling between us.
But really you must pardon me for what I said,
and also forbear from taking offence so easily
should I fall into such remarks again. For, look
you, madam,&mdash;I do not care about female beauty&mdash;neither
is old age disgusting to me. What I admire
in a woman is her disposition&mdash;her <em>mind</em>: and when
I see you flaring up like a hell-rat&mdash;when I behold
you waxing infuriate as a beldame&mdash;I love you better
than if you was the most lovely virgin on the face
of the earth. However&mdash;enough of that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough indeed!” cried Mrs. Mortimer, who
experienced the most ineffable repugnance&mdash;the
most profound loathing for the monster that thus
dinned his hideous idiosyncrasies in her ears: but,
veiling her abhorrence as much as she could, she
said, “And now, perhaps, you will have the goodness
to inform me how you intend to proceed in
order to recover this large sum of money.”</p>

<p>“The explanation is simple enough,” responded
the Doctor. “Vitriol Bob has a particular haunt&mdash;a
certain lurking-hole, not a hundred miles from
here; and I happen to know where the place is. In
fact, Bob and I have been pals for a long, long
time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I thought you told me just now that you had
a spite against him?” interrupted Mrs. Mortimer,
fixing her eyes keenly upon the Doctor, as if to read
the secrets of his inmost soul and learn whether
he were deceiving her.</p>

<p>“Ah! you may look, ma’am&mdash;and look as searchingly
as you like,” exclaimed Jack Rily, who understood
what was passing in her mind: “but you
won’t find me out in any contradiction&mdash;nor yet to
telling you any lies. I said that Vitriol Bob and I
had been friends for a long time&mdash;and I said truly.
But that doesn’t prevent me from having a hankering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
to be avenged for a trick he played me, and
which he does not think I even suspect. The fact
is, we robbed a house together; and Bob in ransacking
a chest of drawers, got hold of a bag full
of sovereigns. He stuck to them, and never uttered
a word about them when we afterwards divided the
swag. I found it out through an advertisement
that appeared in the papers offering a reward for
the apprehension of the burglars, and specifying the
things stolen. He never saw that advertisement, I
know; and I did not tell him of it. I however
swore to have my turn against him sooner or
later;&mdash;and I bided my time. That time is now
come&mdash;and I shall let him know it before many
hours are over his head.”</p>

<p>“But are you certain that you can find him? and,
even supposing that you do succeed in tracing him
to his lurking-hole, how do you know that the old
man will be there also?” demanded Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“There is no tracing out Vitriol Bob in the matter,”
exclaimed Jack Rily. “The moment he has
committed a robbery, he always goes straight to
his usual haunt, and remains there for a few days
till the storm has blown over. As a mere precaution,
he will compel his pal&mdash;this old man&mdash;to go
with him; because if the latter was taken up by
the Detectives, he might be induced to peach against
Bob&mdash;and all that. So I am sure we shall find them
together: unless, indeed,” added the Doctor, in a
tone of diminishing confidence,&mdash;“unless, I say, the
old man knows that you dare not raise a hue and
cry touching this robbery.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” returned Mrs. Mortimer,
“that old man, whose name is Torrens, has every
reason to believe that I would persecute him with
the most implacable vengeance which a human
being is capable of experiencing or inflicting.”</p>

<p>“So much the better!” cried Jack Rily, grinning
joyously: “in this case we are sure of our
prey.”</p>

<p>“And is the game to be played by violence, or by
cunning?” asked Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“By violence, my good lady&mdash;by violence, to be
sure!” responded the burglar, his eyes glowing
savagely, with their ominous yellow lustre&mdash;as if
the orbs of a tiger were glaring upon the woman:
and, though the gorgeous sun-light was flooding
the small chamber with its golden haze, still shone
that yellow lustre apart&mdash;distinct&mdash;and sinister.</p>

<p>“By violence?” repeated Mrs. Mortimer, awful
thoughts relative to Vitriol Bob’s peculiar mode of
proceeding rushing in upon her soul.</p>

<p>“How can it be done otherwise?” demanded Jack
Rily. “When I first came up to you just now, I
was going to propose to enlist in the service a pal
of mine&mdash;and of Vitriol Bob’s also&mdash;who would aid
and assist: but then he would require his thirds as
a matter of course. Since, however, you have informed
me that Bob’s companion in the robbery is
an old, emaciated, feeble man, and that you can
master him by yourself, you and I will keep the
business in our own hands. I will undertake to
tackle Vitriol Bob, if you will make sure of the
other.”</p>

<p>“And supposing that your opponent should overpower
you?” said Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“I will take care that he does not,” returned
Rily. “Trust me to subdue him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And without bloodshed?” observed the old
woman, shuddering&mdash;for, depraved and wicked as
she was, she grew cold and her heart sank within
her at the idea of murder.</p>

<p>“Come, if you’re squeamish, you had better abandon
the project and leave it all to me,” said the
Doctor. “If Vitriol Bob should place my life in
danger, at that moment he is a dead man. Self-preservation,
ma’am, is the first law of nature. At
the same time, I shall not kill <em>him</em>, unless it is to
save <em>myself</em>: of this you may be assured.”</p>

<p>The old woman remained silent for some moments.
Should she embark in an enterprise so replete
with danger?&mdash;should she incur the risk of
becoming an accomplice in a murder? She trembled
at the thought: and yet her money&mdash;the money that
she had come over to England to obtain&mdash;would be
totally lost to her were she to shrink from the endeavour
to recover it. It was true that, even if it
were regained, one half would pass into the hands
of a stranger: but was it not better to return to
Paris with two thousand seven hundred pounds in
her pocket, than with an empty purse? The stake
was worth venturing;&mdash;and her indecision vanished.</p>

<p>“I am <em>not</em> squeamish in the matter,” she said at
length. “Our bargain and our arrangements hold
good in all respects. That villain Torrens shall not
have the laugh against me: on the contrary, I must
be avenged upon him!”</p>

<p>“There!&mdash;now you are my fine old hyena&mdash;my
adorable tiger-cat, once again!” cried the Doctor.
“I long to see you pounce upon old Torrens, as you
call him; and I would give the best five years of
my life, could I endow you with a complete set of
claws, instead of those comparatively harmless
finger-nails! Wouldn’t you tear his eyes out of
his head? wouldn’t you strike them deep into his
flesh? Do you know that Satan will obtain a glorious
acquisition when the time comes for him to
make a fiend of you?”</p>

<p>And again the monster’s horrible hilarity rang
through the little chamber, as he threw himself back
in the chair and laughed with the most savage
heartiness.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake! cease this unnatural gaiety,”
exclaimed the old woman, scarcely able to subdue
her rage.</p>

<p>“Oh! I must laugh,” cried the wretch, sputtering
through his frightful hare-lip,&mdash;“if it is only to
make you look as ferocious as you do now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer turned towards the window with
disgust; and the wretch’s mirth died away in guttural
sounds.</p>

<p>“Come, now&mdash;I told you that you must not be
angry with me, madam,” he said, at length. “It is
my nature to laugh heartily at times&mdash;and surely
you won’t check such an innocent propensity. But
I will take my leave of you now; and at half-past
ten to-night we must meet at some place as near
Stamford Street as you choose.”</p>

<p>“Where shall it be?” asked the old woman.
“Name the spot&mdash;and I shall be punctual to the
moment.”</p>

<p>“There is a narrow lane running along the side
of Christ Church burial-ground,” responded the
burglar, after a few moments’ reflection: “it leads
from the Blackfriars Road into Collingwood Street&mdash;&mdash;I
suppose you know London well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! perfectly. Go on,” said Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;we will meet in that crooked lane at
half-past ten exactly,” continued Jack Rily. “By
the by,” he added, rising from his chair, “you had
better tell the landlady down stairs that you found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
out I could do nothing for you, and that you have
resigned yourself to put up with your loss. It will
prevent her from suspecting anything queer on account
of your going out so late and remaining away
an hour or so.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me,” replied Mrs. Mortimer: “I
shall know how to make all the excuses that are
necessary. Indeed, if we are successful, I shall not
return again to this place,” she observed, sinking
her voice to a low whisper.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;that is your business. And now good-bye
for the present: at half-past ten we meet in the
place appointed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer spoke a few words of assent; and
the Doctor took his departure, bestowing upon the
woman a familiar nod, accompanied by a grin and
a leer, before he crossed the threshold and closed
the chamber-door behind him.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Mortimer was left alone, she began
to ponder deeply upon the particulars of this interview
which had just terminated.</p>

<p>The man knew the hiding-place where it was
presumed that Vitriol Bob and Torrens had taken
refuge; and it was doubtless some cellar or dangerous
place, where a crime might be committed with
impunity, as well as where the perpetrators of crime
might conceal themselves. Then, what guarantee
had she that Rily would not make her his victim,
after availing himself of her services in subduing
the plunderers and recovering the stolen treasure?</p>

<p>She shuddered as she thought of the peril into
which she was about to precipitate herself: she
trembled from head to foot as she pondered upon
the desperate character of the man who was to be
her companion in the night’s enterprise.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;in spite of his revolting ugliness and
his avowal of a dark career of turpitude&mdash;there
was something like fairness in his speech respecting
a partner in any enterprise in which he might
be engaged: moreover, had he not shown, by the
mere fact of the spite which he cherished against
Vitriol Bob, that his ideas of the honour that ought
to prevail even amongst thieves, were of a fixed
and positive nature? Lastly, had he not stipulated
upon the precise amount that he was to retain for
his services? And would he be thus minute and
nice in details, if he cherished the intention of self-appropriating
the whole?</p>

<p>These arguments, which Mrs. Mortimer seriously
revolved in her mind, may not perhaps appear very
convincing nor very satisfactory to the reader; for,
after all, they were only so many suppositions
placed in juxta-position with the atrocious character
of an avowed desperado. But let it be remembered
that we often reason ourselves into what we
<em>wish</em> to believe, rather than into what we <em>ought</em> to
believe; and we tutor our minds to put faith in
those opinions that best suit our interests rather
than our safety. This is like “hoping against hope:”
still it is a general characteristic of human nature;
and Mrs. Mortimer’s case proved no exception to
the general rule.</p>

<p>In fine, she came to the conclusion that Jack Rily
was a monstrous rogue in respect to the world, but
an honest man towards his pals&mdash;that he would
strip society, were society a single individual, of its
last shirt, but would not lay his finger on the costliest
robe if on the back of an accomplice&mdash;and that
he meant to act, with regard to herself, in the fairest
way possible.</p>

<p>Whether her expectations were fulfilled, will
shortly appear.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, close this chapter without
recording a few comments upon that extraordinary
disposition in human nature to reason one-self into
the belief which one wishes to adopt, to the repudiation
of that which one ought to adopt. For instance,
the man who is floundering about in a perfect
morass of pecuniary troubles, from which he
cannot possibly see any chance of emerging, incessantly
dins in his own mental ears the most
absurd sophisms to convince himself that his position
is not so desperate as it appears. “Well,
something must turn up,” he says: “things are
sure to take a turn soon. I can get Jones to renew
the bill which he holds of mine, when it becomes
due&mdash;Tomkins will hold his bill over for a few
weeks&mdash;and Brown will lend me the money to
satisfy Smith.” In this manner does the poor devil
go on with his castle-building, until he can no
longer blow from his imagination’s pipe another
soap-bubble wherewith to amuse himself. Jones
positively refuses to renew&mdash;Tomkins proves inexorable
in his demand for instantaneous payment&mdash;Brown,
having heard of his difficulties, will not
lend him a farthing&mdash;and Smith, anything but satisfied,
puts a clencher on the whole through the
medium of the sheriffs’-officer. Then, when the
self-deluded wretch awakes from his dream, on
finding himself in gaol or on his way to the Bankruptcy
Court, he says to himself in the bitterness of
his spirit, “I always knew it would come to this!”&mdash;although
for years he had been straining every
effort of the imagination to lull his mind into a contrary
belief!</p>

<p>In the same way does the bashful lover, who has
not as yet proposed to the object of his affections,
but who nevertheless longs to do so, yet fears,
because he has seen her smile more sweetly upon a
handsomer youth than ever she did on him,&mdash;in the
same way does he strive to persuade himself that
she <em>does</em> really love him&mdash;that he has observed
stealthy glances cast from her brilliant eyes towards
him&mdash;that her hand has trembled in his own&mdash;that
her voice has faltered when she has responded to
his common-place remarks upon the weather, the
opera, and the new novel&mdash;that it is a mere flirtation
between herself and the <em>other</em> handsome youth,&mdash;in
fine, that she is dying to receive the proposal
which he has not the courage to make. And in
this manner does he tutor himself to lead a life of
“pleasing pain,” though all the while aware that
the sorest misgivings lie at the bottom of his heart,
beneath the superstructure of delusive hopes and
fond imaginings which perforce he has conjured up
there. Then, when at last he hears from some
kind friend that the beautiful Miss So-and-so was
married yesterday morning to the handsome young
gentleman whom she had loved all along, the self-deluded
wretch exclaims, “Ah! I never thought
that she cared a fig for <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>But worse&mdash;oh! far worse is it with the criminal!
Let us take, for instance, the confidential
clerk, who, for the sake of a mistress or through
love of fine clothes and ostentatious display amongst
his acquaintances, pilfers from his master’s till.
At first his peculations were small and insignificant;
but, being undiscovered, he grows bolder and
more deeply guilty,&mdash;while he endeavours to reason
himself out of the agonising fears that haunt him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
day and night&mdash;pursue him like the spectres of
murdered victims&mdash;and turn his wine into gall,
and the sweets of Beauty’s lip into bitterness.
“It is impossible that I can be detected,” he
mentally exclaims a thousand times in an hour:
“my precautions are so well devised. In a large
business such as this, a few shillings are not
missed. Besides, I so arrange the entries in the
books that the expenditure and the receipts are
proportionate. My employer, too, is kinder towards
me than ever: I possess his confidence&mdash;not for an
instant would he suspect me! And even if I were
found out,&mdash;not that I can be,&mdash;but, I say, even if I
were, he would not suffer me to be disgraced&mdash;he
would hush it up: he would never let <em>me</em> be dragged
into the felon’s dock.” Thus will the infatuated
being reason on, although he sees that his master <em>is</em>
growing cold in his manner, and that there <em>is</em> a suspicion
of foul play somewhere,&mdash;until at length the
explosion takes place&mdash;the self-deluded mortal is
hurried to a felon’s gaol&mdash;his employer proves inveterate
and inexorable&mdash;he is doomed to transportation&mdash;and
in the convict-ship he exclaims in terrible
anguish of mind, while writhing as if in mortal
agony upon his hard pallet, “Fool that I was not
to have stopped short while it was yet time: for I
always foresaw that this must inevitably be the end
of it all!”</p>

<p>Gentle reader&mdash;never against your own settled
convictions endeavour to set up a fabric of delusion:
you may at length succeed in throwing the
former into the background, and persuading yourself
to believe that the latter is a substantial truth;&mdash;but
you will in the long run discover to your cost
that you have stepped out of the broad and straight
highroad to flounder amidst the perils of an interminable
bog.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXII">CHAPTER CLXXII.<br />

<span class="medium">A MAIDEN’S FIRST LOVE.</span></h2>

<p>The day, the incidents of which we are describing,
and which are so numerous and diversified, was
destined to be a memorable one in the life of Agnes
Vernon.</p>

<p>The young maiden, on abruptly quitting Mrs.
Mortimer, returned to the cottage; and, seating
herself at the table in the elegant parlour, she arranged
her drawing materials with the intention of
continuing a landscape which she had commenced
a few days previously.</p>

<p>But she was unsettled and restless: new sensations
stole upon her&mdash;new feelings were excited in
her bosom.</p>

<p>The solitude of the cottage suddenly appeared to
be irksome; and she felt discontented with her condition&mdash;she
knew not why.</p>

<p>Laying down her pencil, she rose from her seat,
approached the window, and gazed forth upon the
open country.</p>

<p>A carriage passed by: in it were two young ladies
and two young gentlemen&mdash;and they were all in
high spirits, conversing cheerfully and laughing
gaily. Agnes sighed&mdash;for the thought struck her
that she too might be happy, and she too might
laugh gaily, if she only had friends and companions!</p>

<p>Presently a lady and gentleman, each on horseback,
passed along the road in front of the cottage.
They were proceeding at a very gentle pace, and
were engaged in conversation. The veil was raised
from the fair Amazon’s countenance, and was thrown
back over her riding-hat; her cheeks were blooming
with a carnation tinge, and her eyes were bent with
melting tenderness on her companion, whose face
was turned towards her, and whose language
was doubtless pleasing to her ears. The countenance
of that lady indicated such real pleasure&mdash;denoted
such pure and genuine happiness, that
again did a sigh escape from the bosom of Agnes
Vernon, as she marvelled why she herself was retained
in the prisonage of solitude, while other
maidens of her own age had their acquaintances
and their associates, and were allowed to divert
themselves in walking or riding about the rural
lanes and the roads that stretched amidst the green
fields.</p>

<p>Never before had anything in the form of repining&mdash;never
until this time had a sentiment partaking
of discontent, arisen in the breast of Agnes
Vernon. She endeavoured to conquer the feeling:
she turned away from the window and played with
a beautiful canary bird that fluttered from its perch
towards the front of its handsome cage the moment
she approached it;&mdash;but its chirping sounded no
longer as sweet music in her ears&mdash;and, in the natural
goodness of her gentle soul, she reproached
herself for her indifference to the joyous testimonials
offered by the little feathered chorister to its
mistress.</p>

<p>She resumed her seat, and once more directed her
attention to her drawing: but she felt in no humour
for an employment that until now was amongst
her most favourite recreations. Closing her portfolio,
she took up “Ivanhoe,” in order to read the
concluding pages of the tale: she however found
her thoughts speedily wandering to other subjects,&mdash;the
letter of Lord William Trevelyan&mdash;the discourse
of Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;and the abrupt termination
of her interview with that female. Throwing
aside the book, she seated herself at the piano, and
ran her taper fingers over the keys: but the music
had no cheering influence upon her&mdash;produced no
soothing effect on her restless soul.</p>

<p>Vexed and annoyed with herself for what she
could not help, and almost alarmed at the change
which had come over her, despite of her exertions
to the contrary, the bewildered maiden returned
to the garden and gathered fresh flowers wherewith
to fill the vases in the parlour: but the tulip
seemed less beautiful, the rose less fragrant, and the
pink less sweet than she had ever before known
them;&mdash;and her task was accomplished hurriedly
and even neglectfully.</p>

<p>At length she sought an arbour in the most
shady and retired part of the garden; and there&mdash;alone
with her own thoughts&mdash;she fell into a profound
reverie upon her secluded life, the mystery
that enveloped her condition, the letter of Lord
William Trevelyan, and the explanations that Mrs.
Mortimer had given her respecting the passion of
love.</p>

<p>For, oh! the gentle Agnes loved now:&mdash;hence
this restlessness&mdash;hence this change which had
come upon her!</p>

<p>She did not blame herself for the part she had
enacted in respect to Trevelyan’s letter: her conscience
told her that she had behaved with prudence
and propriety;&mdash;but she was grieved to think that
any words which had fallen from the lips of Mrs.
Mortimer should have cast suspicion upon the sincerity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
of the individual who had penned the contents
of that missive.</p>

<p>Then she thought within herself that perhaps the
old woman had deceived her&mdash;that Trevelyan could
not possibly empower his messenger to contradict
with her lips the assurances he had committed to
paper!</p>

<p>“Did he not say in his letter that he sought no
secresy nor concealment in respect to my father?”
she asked herself, in the course of her musings:
“how, then, could he prompt his agent to enjoin
the necessity of such secresy and such concealment?
Ah! she has deceived <em>me</em>&mdash;and I have wronged
<em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>A feeling of bitterness smote the tender heart of
Agnes as she came to this conclusion: but, in the
course of a few moments, the idea struck her that if
Lord William Trevelyan received a faithful report
of the particulars of her interview with Mrs. Mortimer
that morning, he would recognise the propriety
of her conduct in returning the letter.</p>

<p>But, ah! had she not bade Mrs. Mortimer desire
the young nobleman to think no more of Agnes
Vernon?&mdash;and might he not obey the injunction?</p>

<p>Poor, innocent Agnes! thine own love is as yet
only in its infancy&mdash;and therefore thou comprehendest
not the extent of that devotion which Trevelyan’s
bosom harbours with regard to thee! Although
within the space of a few hours thou hast
learnt thy first lesson in the school of love, and
though thy mental vision has obtained some insight
into the mysteries of that passion which has
at length shed its influence on thee,&mdash;although a
portion of the veil has fallen from thine eyes, and
thou canst now read more of the human heart than
ever thou could’st before,&mdash;nevertheless, it is but a
nascent flame&mdash;a germinating affection that animates
thee,&mdash;a feeling as yet vague and undefinable:
for thou art still so much the child of natural simplicity
and artless ingenuousness, that thou canst
not entertain a conception of the lasting and persevering
nature of love;&mdash;thou knowest not enough
of its essence and its power to initiate in thine
imagination the thought that Trevelyan would no
more heed thine injunction, even if it reached his
ears, than the tempest will obey the human voice
which dares to order its fury to subside!</p>

<p>For some hours did the beauteous Agnes remain
in the arbour, plunged in love’s first reverie; and
when the pretty housemaid appeared to inform her
that dinner was served up, Miss Vernon started
from the seat, exclaiming, “Is it possible that it
can be four o’clock? I did not suppose that it was
more than an hour past mid-day?”</p>

<p>Jane cast a look of surprise upon her mistress&mdash;but
said nothing; and almost immediately afterwards
the servant ceased to remember that there
had been anything peculiar in the young lady’s
manner&mdash;for Agnes composed her countenance,
recalled her scattered thoughts, and hurried back
to the cottage,&mdash;so that this very haste on her part
was mistaken by the domestic for her usual gleesomeness
of disposition.</p>

<p>The afternoon repast was soon disposed of; and
Agnes returned to the garden, where she roamed
about until the hour of sunset approached. The
evening was warm and beautiful&mdash;the air was
fragrant with the perfume of the flowers&mdash;and the
hum of insect life was heard around. The scene
had a soothing effect upon the young maiden’s
soul; and, though she was wearied, she was unwilling
as yet to return to the cottage. She felt less
lonely in the spacious garden than she should be,
as she well knew, in that parlour where she had
vainly endeavoured in the morning to divert herself
with her drawings, her music, and her
books.</p>

<p>We know not how it was&mdash;but more than once
during this evening ramble in her garden, did Agnes
Vernon pass by that very spot where she had stood
in the morning when held in conversation with
Mrs. Mortimer. Those who love, or who have
loved, will probably assert that it was the influence
of some vague and undefined hope which thus occasionally
directed the maiden’s footsteps thither,&mdash;a
hope which nature prompted, although thus
dimly, and in spite of the virgin purity and immaculate
candour of her soul,&mdash;a hope, in fine, which
whispered, softly as zephyr’s breath, in her ear, that
Trevelyan’s messenger <em>might</em> return with an assurance
from him that no instructions which he had
given to that emissary in any way militated against
the honourable, frank, and straightforward declarations
contained in his letter.</p>

<p>And now, then, behold the beauteous Agnes
standing on the very spot where in the morning
she had read the letter that first awoke a scintillation
of love’s fire in her bosom: behold her, motionless
as a statue, amidst the foliage of that secluded
part of the garden&mdash;her white dress delineating the
soft and graceful outlines of her symmetrical form&mdash;and
the rays of the sun, now low in the western
horizon, playing upon her angelic countenance, as
they penetrated through the trees that skirted the
lane overlooked by the hedge.</p>

<p>Suddenly the maiden starts and listens&mdash;like the
timid roe disturbed in the forest by a far-off sound
resembling the bay of the hound.</p>

<p>The noise of wheels and of horses’ hoofs falls
upon her ear: nearer and nearer that noise approaches&mdash;the
vehicle is evidently coming down the
lane!</p>

<p>Yet why does her heart palpitate?&mdash;why seems it
like the fluttering bird in its cage? Is it an unusual
thing for a carriage or a cart to pass that
way? No: but there is in the maiden’s soul a presentiment
that the occurrence <em>now</em> is not altogether
unconnected with her destinies.</p>

<p>The sounds cease: the vehicle, whatever it may
be, has stopped&mdash;and silence once more reigns
around.</p>

<p>The sun is sinking lower and lower in the western
horizon: yet it is still quite light;&mdash;but the ruddy
lustre of the setting orb imparts a deep autumnal
hue to the foliage&mdash;brings out into bolder relief the
ripening apples, the yellow pears, and the crimson
cherries that gem the boughs with their fruitage&mdash;and
imparts a delicate glow to the beauteous countenance
of the young lady, as, with lips apart and
in attitude of suspense, she listens to catch the
slightest sound that may indicate the approach of a
human being.</p>

<p>And now there is a rustling as of silk and a
tread as of light footsteps; and Agnes, who, in consequence
of the surface of the garden being much
higher than the lane on the other side of the hedge,
can look over that verdant boundary,&mdash;Agnes beholds
a lady advancing rapidly down the narrow
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>A feeling of disappointment seizes upon her: she
sees that it is not Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;and something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
tells her that Trevelyan would not employ another
female emissary.</p>

<div id="i_265" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_265.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then it strikes her that she ought to rejoice that
no farther progress should be made in the young
nobleman’s suit during her father’s absence; and
she feels that she has done wrong even to remain
standing in that spot under the influence of a contrary
expectation and of a tender though dimly
significant hope.</p>

<p>With a sigh, the beauteous creature is about to
turn away and re-enter the cottage, when,&mdash;oh!
wonder and amazement!&mdash;with renewed suspense
and reviving hope, she hears herself called by her
name&mdash;called, too, in the tenderest, most melting
tones of a woman’s voice.</p>

<p>“Agnes&mdash;dearest Agnes! Stay&mdash;oh! stay&mdash;if
only for a few moments! Stay&mdash;I implore you&mdash;beloved
girl: you know not who it is that thus
addresses you!”</p>

<p>These words were uttered in a voice of warm and
passionate affection&mdash;so that a deep and absorbing
interest was at once created in the bosom of Agnes
towards that lady of whose handsome countenance
she had now a full view, and the earnest, appealing
expression of whose features gave additional import
to her enthusiastic exclamations.</p>

<p>“Madam&mdash;I will stay&mdash;I will not depart immediately,”
faltered Agnes, forgetting her father’s injunctions
relative to the caution which she was to
exercise in regard to strangers: “but how do you
know who I am?&mdash;and who are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! that she should ask me who I am!” cried
the lady, clasping her hands together in deep
anguish. “But how beautiful she is!” exclaimed
the stranger, in an altered and rejoicing tone: “how
faithful, too, is the portrait! Agnes&mdash;dearest Agnes&mdash;I
have much to say to you&mdash;much to impart that
you will be delighted to learn: but must we continue
to discourse thus, with this barrier between
us? Can you not come to me?&mdash;or will you permit
me to come to you? I long&mdash;oh! how I long to
embrace you, dear girl that you are; and though
we are but a few feet apart&mdash;yet does this garden-boundary
separate us most cruelly!”</p>

<p>“Madam&mdash;I know not how to answer you,” murmured
Agnes, strange feelings of mingled pleasure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
apprehension, and hope agitating in her heart, as if
that heart were a well of deep, inexhaustible, and
yet incomprehensible emotions. “Your words
seem to move me more than I can explain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;Agnes&mdash;dear Agnes,” ejaculated the lady,
stretching out her arms in an appealing manner towards
the maiden: “’tis the voice of nature that
speaks within you! But you hesitate to trust yourself
with me? Ah! doubtless you have been
warned&mdash;doubtless you have been urged to act with
caution&mdash;&mdash;Oh! my God&mdash;that you should look
with an eye of suspicion upon me!”</p>

<p>And with these words, which were uttered in a
tone indicative of the most acute anguish, the lady
burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Agnes stood blanched, and trembling, and speechless,&mdash;having
a deep conviction that the lady’s fate
was in some way linked with her own&mdash;yet not
daring to form a conjecture as to the nature of the
tie that thus mysteriously bound them together. A
secret impulse appeared to urge her towards the
weeping stranger; and she felt that were the arms
again extended towards her, and were there no
barrier in her way, she should precipitate herself
upon that stranger’s bosom, that they might mingle
their tears together and interchange the sympathies
that already drew them to each other.</p>

<p>“Agnes&mdash;dearest Agnes,” exclaimed the lady,
suddenly breaking silence and wiping away the
traces of her grief,&mdash;speaking, too, in a voice of
heart-touching appeal,&mdash;“I implore you to come to
me&mdash;or to show me how I may enter those precincts
without being observed by the inmates of the dwelling!
But, say&mdash;tell me,” she added, a sudden
thought striking her,&mdash;“is he&mdash;your father&mdash;<em>there</em>?”</p>

<p>“My father is in Paris,” replied Agnes: “he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” ejaculated the stranger, with an
enthusiasm that astonished and even startled the
maiden. “But Mrs. Gifford&mdash;is she still alive?&mdash;is
she still in attendance on you?”</p>

<p>“She is in the house at this moment,” returned
Agnes, more and more surprised at these questions&mdash;not
only on account of their nature, which showed
that the lady was acquainted with many circumstances
regarding her condition; but also in consequence
of the vehemence with which they were put.</p>

<p>“Then how can I join you in that garden?” demanded
the lady, in a tone of bitter disappointment.
“Oh! Agnes, you know not how ardent are the
yearnings&mdash;how intense the longings that prompt me
even to dash through this hedge and fold you to my
bosom! Cruel girl&mdash;keep me not thus in an agony
of suspense; but come&mdash;come to my arms&mdash;as if I
were your mother!”</p>

<p>“My mother!” exclaimed Agnes, in a voice of mingled
hope and amazement&mdash;while such indescribable
emotions started into existence in her bosom, that she
felt overpowered by their influence, and staggering
back a few paces, would have fallen to the ground
had she not leant against a tree for support.</p>

<p>“Agnes&mdash;Agnes!” cried the lady, imploringly:
“give not way to thoughts that will deprive you of
your presence of mind&mdash;for you need all your self-possession
now! Agnes&mdash;dear Agnes&mdash;answer
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who are you? O heaven! such strange ideas&mdash;such
wild hopes&mdash;such bewildering presentiments
crowd upon my soul,” exclaimed the beauteous
maiden, “that I know not how to act nor what to
conjecture!”</p>

<p>And, again approaching the hedge, she passed her
hand across her brow, throwing from her face the
shower of curls that had fallen in disorder over that
charming countenance&mdash;the luxuriant locks having
been disturbed by the movement given to the neat
little straw bonnet when she staggered against the
tree.</p>

<p>“You ask me who I am,” said the lady: “oh!
pity my suspense&mdash;have mercy upon me&mdash;come to
my arms&mdash;and I will tell you all.”</p>

<p>“Stay there, madam&mdash;dear madam,” cried Agnes,
without another instant’s hesitation&mdash;so earnest, so
pathetic was that last appeal: “and I will join you
at all risks!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXIII">CHAPTER CLXXIII.<br />

<span class="medium">HOPES FULFILLED.</span></h2>

<p>Without pausing to reflect upon the step which
she was taking&mdash;forgetful of all the injunctions she
had received from her father, and all the promises
of prudence and caution which she had made to him&mdash;obedient
only to the irresistible impulse of her
feelings&mdash;as if nature’s voice rose dominant above a
sire’s mandates,&mdash;the Recluse of the Cottage disappeared
from the view of the lady, who remained in
the path outside the garden, a prey to the most torturing
fear lest the young maiden should be intercepted
by the inmates of the dwelling.</p>

<p>But Agnes was not compelled to pass through
the house in order to gain egress from the premises.
From the stable-yard a gate opened into the lane;
and by this avenue did she proceed&mdash;so that there
was no necessity to exercise any wariness or precaution.
Had the contrary been the case&mdash;had she
been compelled to pause in order to reflect how she
was to escape the notice of the servants, her artlessness
of character and purity of soul would have
prompted her to wait and reflect whether she were
acting in accordance with her father’s counsels.
She would then have flown straight to consult Mrs.
Gifford; and the result would have been inimical
to the hopes and wishes of the lady who was so
anxiously expecting her in the lane.</p>

<p>But as nothing impeded the maiden’s progress,
nor forced her to stay her steps even for a single
instant,&mdash;the gate being always left open during
the day-time for the convenience of the gardeners,
and these men being engaged in front of the house
on the present occasion,&mdash;the current of her
thoughts, impelling her towards the lady, received
no hindrance&mdash;no check; and in a few moments
Agnes was speeding along the lane, with a heart
influenced by emotions of hope, curiosity, suspense,
and wild aspiration.</p>

<p>For that word “Mother”&mdash;that dear, delightful
word, which had so seldom fallen on her ears, and
which in an instant excited so many pleasurable
reflections&mdash;so many ineffable feelings in her soul,&mdash;that
word which, as if with electric inspiration, had
suddenly opened to her view an elysium of the affections
which she had never known before, and
which gave promises of felicity the holiest and the
purest,&mdash;that word, so fraught with the tenderest
sympathies to one who had hitherto lived in a semi-orphan
state,&mdash;that word it was which exercised a
magic influence upon the maiden&mdash;absorbed all
other considerations&mdash;and rendered her impatient
to hear more from the same lips whence this word
had come.</p>

<p>And yet she could not have accounted, had she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
paused to search, for the spring of the excitement that
now ruled her actions. It was not that she cherished
the conviction of finding a mother in the lady who
was waiting to embrace her; but she did half suspect
that such would be the case,&mdash;and she certainly
hoped&mdash;oh! most fervently hoped that she was not
destined to experience disappointment. The very
artlessness of her disposition made her sanguine;&mdash;and
under these influences did she hasten
along.</p>

<p>The lady advanced to meet her;&mdash;and in a few
moments they were clasped in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>“My child&mdash;my dearest child!” murmured the
fond mother, who had indeed recovered a daughter
in Agnes Vernon.</p>

<p>“Oh! Is it possible?” exclaimed the beautiful
creature, in an ecstasy of joy: “is it possible that
you are my parent?”</p>

<p>“I am, my beloved Agnes&mdash;I am: and heaven can
attest that, though separated from thee since thine
infancy, I have never ceased to think of thee&mdash;never
ceased to love thee!”</p>

<p>A faintness now came upon Agnes;&mdash;and her
mother felt that she was clinging the more firmly to
her in a convulsive effort to prevent herself from
falling.</p>

<p>“Lean on me, my child&mdash;here&mdash;let me sustain
you, my darling Agnes!” cried the lady. “Oh! how
happy am I at this moment&mdash;with thee in my arms!
But&mdash;&mdash;My God! she faints!”</p>

<p>And the maiden, overcome by her emotions, fell
into a state of insensibility.</p>

<p>The lady carried her in her arms along the lane:
great was the strength which now animated the
mother who had just recovered a long-lost daughter;&mdash;and
in a few minutes a hackney-coach, that
was waiting higher up the avenue, received the
precious burthen.</p>

<p>When Agnes came to herself, she started as if, on
waking from a delicious dream, she feared that it
might prove all a delusion: but when, by the rays
of the setting sun which streamed through the open
windows of the vehicle, she beheld the handsome,
pleasing, and yet mournful countenance of her mother
bending over her, a glow of joy suffused the
charming creature’s face&mdash;and, throwing her arms
around her parent’s neck, she exclaimed, “Oh! tell
me that it is not a dream! assure me once more
who you are!”</p>

<p>“I am your mother, Agnes dearest&mdash;your own
fond and loving mother, who has languished after
you for years, and who will never separate from you
again, unless by your own consent, or through the
stern decree of an iron tyranny! Yes, Agnes&mdash;I am
your mother;&mdash;and, beautiful though you be, I may
without vanity declare that the stamp of nature
proclaims you to be my child?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and my own heart’s emotions assure me
that you are indeed my parent,” said the lovely girl.
“But you observed that we should not part without
my consent. Oh! can you suppose, dear mother,
that I should ever ask to leave you&mdash;ever seek to
separate myself from you?”</p>

<p>“No, my child&mdash;I am sure that you will not!” exclaimed
the lady. “At the same time, Agnes,” she
added, in a different and mournful tone, “it is my
duty to inform you that if you choose to live with
me, you must resign all hope of seeing your father
again&mdash;at least for two years&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! say not so!” ejaculated Agnes, bursting
into tears. “Surely it must be with my father’s
knowledge that you came to see me&mdash;that you are
taking me away with you. And yet,” she added, a
sudden reminiscence flashing to her mind, and
causing her to start painfully,&mdash;“and yet, I recollect
now that I left the garden stealthily&mdash;that you
urged me to come round to you in the lane, unperceived
by the servants&mdash;that you knew not my father
was in Paris. Oh! mother, mother,” cried the
young girl, again interrupting herself, and speaking
with a burst of anguish,&mdash;“what does all this mean?
Whom am I to obey&mdash;you or my father?&mdash;for it is
clear to me that in yielding deference to the counsel
of the one, I must prove disobedient to the other!”</p>

<p>“Tranquillise yourself, dearest Agnes&mdash;tranquillise
yourself, I implore you!” exclaimed the lady,
straining the trembling&mdash;almost affrighted maiden
to her breast.</p>

<p>“Ah! dearest mother, when I hear your voice
and receive your kisses, I have no thought save for
you,” murmured the young girl. “Oh! and now
your tears fall upon my cheek. Mother&mdash;dear
mother&mdash;forgive me for what I said ere now&mdash;I will
obey you&mdash;and you only. But do not&mdash;do not weep,
my beloved parent!”</p>

<p>“May God Almighty bless you, Agnes!” fervently
exclaimed the lady, her tears streaming in blinding
torrents from her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh! do not weep&mdash;I implore you!” cried Agnes,
in a tone of the most tender affection. “Are you
unhappy, dear mother? If so, tell me the cause of
your sorrow!”</p>

<p>“I am both happy and unhappy, Agnes,” was the
response, almost choked with sobs. “I experience
ineffable pleasure and acute pain, all at the same
moment! But your words soothe me&mdash;your voice descends
into my soul like sweet music&mdash;your caresses
are as a balm to my bruised and weltering spirit!”</p>

<p>“Dear mother, let me embrace you closer still!”
murmured Agnes, clinging to her parent in that
narrow chaise as if there were an imminent danger
of their immediate separation. “But wherefore are
you happy and unhappy at the same time?”</p>

<p>“I am happy because I have this evening recovered
you, and thus seen accomplished the hope of long,
long years,” returned the lady; “and I am unhappy
because I fear that some untoward circumstance
will part us again.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what circumstance can part us, dear mother?”
asked Agnes, her bosom filled with vague
alarms. “May I not dwell with you, if I choose&mdash;and
if you choose to have me with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;oh! yes, Agnes,” replied her mother, earnestly
and in an impassioned tone. “But will you
not pine&mdash;when the excitement of these new feelings
shall have passed away,&mdash;will you not pine, I say,
for your secluded cottage&mdash;your beautiful garden&mdash;and&mdash;and
your father?” she added, her voice suddenly
becoming low and tremulously plaintive.</p>

<p>“What is that lovely cottage&mdash;what are the
choicest flowers of that garden, in comparison with
thy love, my dearest&mdash;dearest mother?” exclaimed
Agnes: “and, oh! if I must decide between you, on
the one hand, and my father on the other&mdash;&mdash;And
yet he has been so kind&mdash;so very kind to me&mdash;that
it goes to my very heart&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Agnes&mdash;Agnes&mdash;you love your father better
than me!” exclaimed the mother, in a voice of the
most piercing, rending anguish. “But it is natural&mdash;oh!
it is natural&mdash;for you never knew me until
now&mdash;at least not since your infancy! Yes, it is
natural, I say! Oh! fool that I was to hope that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
you could love me well enough to consent to dwell
beneath my roof in future! No&mdash;no&mdash;it is impossible:
I see it all, Agnes&mdash;you would be wretched&mdash;miserable,
were you to part from your father!
I will take you back to your cottage, then, my
child&mdash;I will leave you then&mdash;and we must separate
upon its threshold, never&mdash;never to meet again,
perhaps, in this life!”</p>

<p>“No, dearest mother&mdash;speak not thus despairingly&mdash;or
you will kill me&mdash;you will break my
heart!” cried Agnes, her voice choking with sobs.
“You are unhappy&mdash;and it is my duty to remain
with you&mdash;&mdash;Oh! and God forgive me for saying
it, if it be a crime&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;it is also my wish!”</p>

<p>And with these words, the maiden again threw
herself upon her mother’s bosom and wept plenteously,
while her arms clasped that parent’s neck
with almost convulsive violence&mdash;as if she feared to
lose her.</p>

<p>“Now, Agnes, I am happy&mdash;oh! supremely
happy!” exclaimed the fond woman. “You will
remain with me&mdash;and I shall not again submit
your feelings to a painful test by proposing the
alternatives which have already rent your bosom.
Listen, however, to me for a short space. I am a
lonely and desolate woman, and have experienced a
recent affliction of an almost overpowering nature.
Indeed, I should have succumbed beneath its
weight, had not accident&mdash;an accident of a most
extraordinary character&mdash;last night revealed to me
the place where you dwelt in such seclusion. Then
I suddenly felt that I had something worth living
for&mdash;and I came to you this evening, with the hope
of seeing you&mdash;yes&mdash;and also with the hope of inducing
you to accompany me, that we might dwell
together in future. For, oh! Agnes, you cannot
divine how tender&mdash;how lasting&mdash;how invincible is
the love of a mother for her child. Years and years
have passed since I saw you; and I have pictured
to myself my darling daughter growing up in
beauty and in virtue&mdash;endowed with elegant accomplishments,
and trained in all that she ought
to learn or that would become her&mdash;save a knowledge
of her mother! Now, my dearest Agnes, you
repay me for that immense&mdash;that boundless love
which I have ever cherished for you: now you reward
me for the anxious years&mdash;the age of sorrow,
as I may term the period which has elapsed, for me,
between your infancy and the present time. Your
father is rich&mdash;is possessed of many resources for
recreation and pleasure in the world, which a woman
cannot enjoy. He has many, many friends;&mdash;and,
deeply though he loves you, he will not miss
you so much as I have missed you, and should miss
you still, were you now to be separated from me.
It is, then, a mother who implores her daughter
to give her a daughter’s love&mdash;to yield her a
daughter’s affection&mdash;and perform towards her a
daughter’s duty. All this, my Agnes, I see that
you are prepared to accomplish&mdash;even at the sacrifice
of your feelings in respect to your sire. Moreover,
that sire has been blessed with your smiles
ever since your birth&mdash;or at least has had you under
his guardianship and control: and now&mdash;oh! now,
am I asking too much when I beseech you to devote
a few years of love to me,&mdash;to me who am
your mother&mdash;who am unhappy&mdash;and who, without
you, should now feel so lonely and desolate that
the sooner the cold grave were to close over me,
the better!”</p>

<p>“I will not leave you&mdash;I will die sooner!” murmured
Agnes, her eyes streaming and her bosom
heaving with convulsive sobs. “But you will not
leave my father&mdash;nor that kind and good Mrs.
Gifford&mdash;in ignorance of what has become of me?”</p>

<p>“I could not be guilty of such cruelty, my darling
child,” responded the mother. “And now,”
she continued, after a rapid glance from the window
of the vehicle, which was at this moment
passing by Kennington Common,&mdash;“and now listen
again to what I have to say to you. My own house
is in the northern suburb of London; and it is possible
that Mrs. Gifford may be acquainted with the
place of my abode. I know not whether she be;
and I should conceive that she is <em>not</em>&mdash;nevertheless,
there <em>is</em> the possibility, as I observed&mdash;and, in
that case, she would adopt measures to tear you
from my arms. For this night, then, you must consent
to remain at the house of some ladies of my
acquaintance. They will take care of you&mdash;they
will be rejoiced to have you with them, though only
for a few hours; and by to-morrow evening I shall
have a dwelling fitted up for our reception. It is
my intention to give up my villa which I now possess&mdash;and
I know of a sweet cottage, with a beautiful
garden, in the neighbourhood of Bayswater,
which I shall hire at once. All these arrangements
can be effected in the course of to-morrow&mdash;for by
means of money incredible things are accomplished
in London.”</p>

<p>“Be it as you say, my dear mother,” observed
Agnes. “But you will remain with me this night?&mdash;you
will not leave me with strangers?” she exclaimed
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my child, if you wish it, I will stay
with you,” returned her mother. “Listen, however,
to me once again. The friends in whose care
I propose to place you, are two elderly ladles, who
will receive you as the daughter of one whom they
sincerely love&mdash;for they are as devoted to me as if I
were a near and dear relative, and are acquainted
with much that concerns me. You will be as safe
in their charge as if I myself were with you: for,
remember,&mdash;by to-morrow night I must have a
home&mdash;a good home&mdash;prepared for my Agnes,&mdash;and
it will occupy me until a late hour <em>this</em> night to
make the arrangements for the removal of all my
furniture and other property in the morning. In
addition to all this, Agnes, I should be compelled
in any case to return to my house this evening,&mdash;as
there may be a communication of importance for me
there,&mdash;a communication from a generous friend&mdash;noble
by nature as well as by name&mdash;and who is
interesting himself for me and for <em>another</em>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say no more, my dearest parent,” interrupted
Agnes. “I am ready to obey you in all things and
to follow your counsel: but promise to return and
take me away with you as early as you can to-morrow,”
she added imploringly.</p>

<p>“Fear not, my darling Agnes,” replied the mother:
“I shall be as anxious to embrace you to-morrow
as you possibly can be to see me.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was in progress between
the two ladles in the hackney-coach, the sun had
set&mdash;twilight had become absorbed in the shades of
night&mdash;but the vehicle was now proceeding along
the Blackfriars-road, which was brilliant with the
gas-lamps stretching away in two approximating
lines, and ultimately becoming confounded together
on the arching bridge in the distance.</p>

<p>At length the hackney-coach passed out of the
Blackfriars-road into Stamford-street; and Agnes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
looking from the left-hand window, saw that the
three first houses on that side of the way, towards
which her eyes were turned, were in a condition so
ruinous and dismantled as to strike a chill to her
susceptible heart. But the unpleasant sensation
almost instantly vanished, when the coach drew up
at the door of a house in excellent repair, and presenting,
in outward appearance, a remarkable contrast
to those dilapidated buildings.</p>

<p>Here Agnes and her mother alighted; and the
young maiden no longer thought of the sinister-looking
ruins adjoining, when she found herself in a
comfortable parlour, where both herself and parent
received a cordial welcome from two elderly ladies
whose benevolent countenances, agreeable manners,
and kind speech were calculated to inspire confidence
at once.</p>

<p>The name of these maiden sisters was Theobald;
and they were indeed possessed of excellent dispositions
and endowed with the most amiable qualities.
The moment that Agnes’ mother entered the room,
they rose to embrace her with the warmth of an
unfeigned friendship; and even before the young
maiden was introduced to them, they exclaimed, as
if suddenly struck by the same sentiment, “Ah! this
is the dear girl whom you have so long pined to recover?
We need not wait to be told that she is your
daughter: the likeness between you proclaims the
fact!”</p>

<p>And then they embraced Agnes in her turn.</p>

<p>The young lady’s mother drew the elder Miss
Theobald aside, and said, “I propose to leave my
beloved child with you for this night. Circumstances
compel me to return home without delay. I have
decided upon taking your beautiful little villa at
Bayswater, and shall remove all my furniture thither
the first thing in the morning. It is fortunate that
the sweet dwelling should have been thus in want
of a tenant at this moment.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted for your sake, my dear friend,”
responded Miss Theobald, “that the villa is unoccupied.
We will send one of our servants at
day-break to make all the necessary preparations for
your reception. Oh! how sincerely&mdash;how deeply
do I congratulate you upon having recovered your
long-lost daughter!” added the kind-hearted woman,
in a tone of profound feeling.</p>

<p>“It is indeed a source of indescribable solace
to my wounded spirit, as you, my dear friend, may
well conceive&mdash;for you are acquainted with the
principal events of my chequered existence. But
I must now depart: it is growing late&mdash;and ere I
seek my couch this night, I shall have arranged
everything for my removal to Bayswater to-morrow.”</p>

<p>With these words the lady turned towards Agnes,
saying, “My dearest child, I leave you in the care
of these excellent friends, whom it is only necessary
to know in order to love.”</p>

<p>“I feel that I do already love them, my dear
mother,” responded the young maiden, as she threw
herself into her parent’s arms.</p>

<p>“Farewell&mdash;till to-morrow, my sweet Agnes:
soon after mid-day you may expect me&mdash;and the
Miss Theobalds can tell you that the new home
to which you are then to accompany me, will leave
you nothing to regret in reference to your own
little secluded cottage and beautiful garden in
Surrey.”</p>

<p>“Wherever I may dwell with you, dear mother&mdash;there
shall I enjoy contentment,” answered Agnes,
tenderly embracing her whom in two short hours
she had thus learnt to love with an affection that
seemed to have existed for years.</p>

<p>“Adieu, my darling child,” murmured the fond
mother; and she then took her departure.</p>

<p>Agnes listened until the sounds of the retreating
wheels were no longer audible&mdash;or rather, until
they were absorbed in the din of the numerous
vehicles passing in the immediate neighbourhood
of the house: and then a sudden chill seized upon
her heart&mdash;a damp fell upon her spirits&mdash;her feelings,
powerfully excited by the incidents of the day,
experienced a rapid revulsion&mdash;and, unable to control
her emotions, she burst into tears.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXIV">CHAPTER CLXXIV.<br />

<span class="medium">A NIGHT OF TERRORS.</span></h2>

<p>The two ladies hastened to console&mdash;or, speaking
with greater accuracy, endeavoured to console
the weeping girl. But, although she knew how
friendly disposed they were towards her&mdash;although
she felt the full extent of their kindness, and even
reproached herself with her inability to yield to its
soothing influence,&mdash;yet it seemed as if the departure
of her mother had left her more alone in the
world than ever she was before.</p>

<p>“Dry those tears, my sweet Agnes,” said the elder
Miss Theobald, pressing the maiden’s delicate white
hand with cordiality and tenderness.</p>

<p>“Oh! do not give way to a sorrow for which you
have no real cause,” urged the younger of the two
ladies. “A few hours will soon pass, my dear child,
and your fond parent will return.”</p>

<p>But Agnes, though acknowledging by her gestures
the kindness of the sisters, could not subdue her
grief; and her sobbing became more convulsive.</p>

<p>For a tide of conflicting and painful reflections
rushed in upon her soul. She remembered all her
father’s goodness towards her&mdash;the strong injunctions
he had given her not to hold intercourse with
any one who was not the bearer of a letter from
him&mdash;and the grief that he would experience when
he heard of her departure. She thought, likewise,
of the terror and dismay which must even already
reign at the cottage on account of her mysterious
absence: she beheld, in imagination, the excellent-hearted
Mrs. Gifford and the good-natured Jane
inconsolable at her loss;&mdash;and, apart from all these
ideas, she now felt certain misgivings arise in her
bosom relative to the step she had taken. Vainly
did she endeavour to persuade herself that, acting
by the counsel and in obedience to the prayers of
her mother, she could not have done wrong: a
secret voice appeared to reproach her&mdash;an unknown
tongue seemed to whisper ominous things in her
ears. Terror gained upon her; and, under its influence,
her grief became less violent. But her
thoughts grew confused&mdash;there was a hurry in her
brain: she felt as if she had just awakened from a
wild and painful dream, and was still unable to
collect her scattered ideas;&mdash;and still amidst that
confusion, flashed, with vivid brightness to her
memory, the warning which her sire had so emphatically
given to her respecting the snares that
were set by the wicked to entrap the artless and
the innocent. At length, overcome by the terror
which thus rapidly acquired a complete empire over
her soul, and forgetting all that was re-assuring and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
consolatory in her present petition, Agnes Vernon
fell upon her knees before the two amazed ladies,
exclaiming, as she extended her clasped hands
wildly towards them, “Take me home again to my
cottage&mdash;take me home again, I implore you!”</p>

<p>“My dearest child,” said the elder Miss Theobald,
accompanying her soothing words with the tenderest
caresses; “what do you fear?&mdash;wherefore do you
wish to leave us? Are we not your mother’s
friends?&mdash;and can you not persuade yourself to
look upon us in the same light?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, madam&mdash;I know&mdash;I feel that you are
my friend&mdash;that you wish me well!” cried Agnes,
her apprehensions dissipating, but only to allow
scope for her anguish to burst forth again.</p>

<p>“Why, then, do you thus give way to your grief?”
asked Miss Theobald, raising the young maiden
gently, and as gently leading her to a seat.</p>

<p>“I cannot explain my sensations,” sobbed the
poor girl: “and yet I feel very&mdash;very unhappy.”</p>

<p>“You have doubtless been much excited this
evening, my love,” was the reply: “but a good
night’s rest will tranquillise you. And remember&mdash;you
are beneath a friendly roof, and where harm
cannot reach you.”</p>

<p>“But I tremble lest I have done wrong, madam,”
exclaimed Agnes. “How is it that my father ordains
one thing, and my mother counsels another?
Oh! I am bewildered with misgivings&mdash;I know not
what to think, nor how to act?”</p>

<p>“Are you not pleased at having at length embraced
a mother?” said the younger Miss Theobald,
in a tone of gentle reproach.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;oh! yes!” ejaculated Agnes, fervently:
then, in a mournful voice, she observed, “But I have
fled&mdash;surreptitiously fled from the home provided
for me by a fond and trusting father!”</p>

<p>The two ladies fully comprehended the nature of
the conflicting thoughts that were agitating in the
breast of Agnes Vernon; and they exchanged rapid
glances of mingled sorrow and apprehension. They
saw that on one side was a suddenly awakened and
ardent love for a mother; and that on the other was
a sense of the deference and obedience, as well as of
the gratitude, due to an affectionate father. They
were, therefore, filled with regret that family circumstances
should have placed that pure, artless,
and innocent girl in a position which compelled her
to balance between the two; and, although they
would have moved heaven and earth to induce her
to decide in favour of the maternal parent, they recognised
the difficulty of the task, and entertained
the deepest alarm for its results.</p>

<p>“To-morrow evening, long before this hour, my
dear Agnes,” said the elder of the ladies, “you will
be comfortably settled in your new home. The
villa which your mother intends to inhabit at
Bayswater, belongs to my sister and myself. It is
a neat little dwelling&mdash;neither too much secluded,
nor too near to the neighbouring houses; and a
large, well-cultivated, and delightful garden is attached
to it. Then, my dear child, reflect&mdash;remember,
that you will possess a constant, a devoted,
and a loving companion in your mother: you will
no longer pass many, many hours&mdash;indeed, the
greater portion of your time&mdash;in solitude and loneliness,
nor be thrown upon the incompatible society
of servants, who, however good in heart and well-intentioned,
are not such associates as you would
select of your own free will.”</p>

<p>“Ah! madam&mdash;your words console me,” said
Agnes, endeavouring to stifle her sobs. “But how
happens it that you should be acquainted with my
late mode of life?”</p>

<p>“I did but guess what that mode of life must have
been,” returned Miss Theobald; “and I see that I
was not far wrong. I knew that your father did
not&mdash;could not dwell with you entirely&mdash;that he
could only be a visitor at your place of abode,
wherever it might be&mdash;and, therefore, I naturally
conjectured that you were thrown almost completely
upon your own resources.”</p>

<p>“And can you tell me, madam,” asked Miss
Vernon, ingenuously, as the thought suddenly
struck her,&mdash;“can you tell me how it is that my
father should wish me to dwell under his guardianship
only, and my mother wishes me to rely solely
upon her? Or, indeed,” she added, after a few
moments’ pause, “I should rather inquire the reason
which prevents my parents from living together
beneath the same roof, and having me with
them? for, according to all the books I have ever
read&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear Agnes,” interrupted the elder sister,
“you would not seek to penetrate into those
mysteries which so unhappily belong to the destinies
of your parents?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no&mdash;no&mdash;if it be improper for a child to ask
an explanation of such secrets!” exclaimed Miss
Vernon, the natural purity of her soul instantly
absorbing the sentiment of curiosity that had
prompted her queries. “And now let me implore
your pardon for having testified so much excitement&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was to be expected, dear child,” said Miss
Theobald; “and you have no pardon to solicit. We
are delighted to perceive that you have at length recovered
some degree of calmness. Rest assured that
you will be happy in the society of your mother,
whom we have known for years&mdash;yes&mdash;many, many
years, and whom we love as much as if she were a
near relative. You will be surprised to learn, Agnes,
that when you were a babe, we often fondled you
in our arms. Yes: you may regard me with surprise&mdash;but
it is nevertheless the fact, that my sister
and myself have frequently&mdash;very frequently nursed
and dandled you for hours together.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I was wrong to exhibit so much mistrust
and want of confidence in you just now!” exclaimed
Agnes, her affectionate soul being deeply touched
by assurances so well calculated to move her, and
which were indeed strictly consonant with truth.</p>

<p>“Think not of what has gone by, my dear child,”
said the younger sister. “We make all possible allowances
for the excited state of your mind; and
we sincerely hope, as we believe, that happiness
awaits you. But it is growing late; and you doubtless
stand in need of refreshment ere you retire to
rest.”</p>

<p>Then, without waiting for an answer, she rang
the bell; and the servant was ordered to bring in
the supper-tray. Agnes was in no humour to partake
of the meal: indeed, she was in that state of
mind when the individual rather loathes the idea of
eating, through a total suspension of the appetite.
But so delicate were the attentions of the kind-hearted
sisters, and so persevering were they in
their endeavours to render their guest as much “at
home” as possible, that Agnes sate down with them
to table; and, if she scarcely ate anything, yet her
spirits revived somewhat from the sociable nature
of the evening repast.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>It was a little after eleven when the Misses Theobald
conducted the young lady to the bedchamber
which had been prepared for her reception; and,
having embraced her affectionately, the good sisters
left her, as they hoped, to the enjoyment of that
repose of which they knew she must stand much in
need.</p>

<p>The moment she found herself alone, the maiden
felt unpleasant thoughts returning to her mind;
and, in order to escape from them, if possible, she
began to lay aside her apparel with unwonted haste.
Everything necessary for her toilette had been provided;
and the chamber, which was at the back of
the house and on the second floor, was elegantly
furnished&mdash;having an air of comfort that would have
been duly appreciated by one in a more settled state
of mind than was the amiable girl at the time. In
a few minutes she retired to rest; and, contrary to
her expectation, sleep soon fell upon her eye-lids&mdash;for
she was worn out and exhausted by the exciting
incidents of the day.</p>

<p>Her dreams were not, however, of a tranquillising
description.</p>

<p>In the first place, she fancied that she was roving
in her garden, and that she beheld Lord William
Trevelyan approaching down the lane. In a few
moments he stood by her side; though how he
passed the verdant boundary was not quite clear to
her. She did not retreat,&mdash;yet she felt that she
ought to retire: but her feet were rivetted to the
ground;&mdash;and when he took her hand, the same
unknown and invisible influence which nailed her
to the spot, forbade her to withdraw that hand
which trembled in his own. Then she imagined
that the young nobleman began to address her in a
style similar to the contents of his letter: she cast
down her eyes&mdash;she felt herself blushing&mdash;and,
though she knew that she ought to retreat, she
nevertheless listened with emotions of pleasure
never experienced before. He pressed her to be
allowed to visit her again; and she was raising her
eyes bashfully towards his countenance, to read his
sincerity in his looks, ere she murmured the affirmative
reply that already trembled upon her tongue,
when she was suddenly shocked to perceive a marvellous
and signal change taking place in him. His
face grew wrinkled&mdash;the handsome features became
distorted and frightful&mdash;his clothes took another
appearance&mdash;and, as she gazed upon him in speechless
wonder and alarm, she saw standing in his
place a hideous old woman, whom she at length
recognised as Mrs. Mortimer. Agnes strove to cry
out&mdash;but could not: a spell was upon her lips;&mdash;and
the harridan’s eyes glared upon her with savage
malignity. The maiden felt herself sinking in terror
to the ground&mdash;when the whole scene experienced
a sudden variation; and she was now in the
parlour of the cottage, with her father seated by
her side.</p>

<p>Neither was this second dream of a tranquillising
description.</p>

<p>Agnes fancied that her sire was angry with her&mdash;that
he uttered reproaches for a disobedience of
which she had been guilty. At first she could not
comprehend the nature of the offence that had entailed
upon her this vituperation, and rendered her
father’s manner so unusually severe towards her&mdash;but
at last it flashed to her mind that she had been
incautious in receiving at the cottage evil-intentioned
visitors;&mdash;and then she suddenly found her
father engaged in a violent dispute with Mrs. Mortimer,
whose countenance seemed more than ever
hideous and revolting. How this dispute originated,
or how Mrs. Mortimer had got into the
room, Agnes knew not: there she however was&mdash;and
the quarrel waxed warmer and warmer. At
length the old woman took her departure: but ere
the door closed behind her, she turned on Agnes a
look of such fiend-like malignity, that a shriek
would have expressed the young maiden’s affright,
had not her lips been mysteriously sealed. When
the harridan had disappeared, Mr. Vernon renewed
his reproaches; and Agnes fancied that, on falling
on her knees in the presence of her sire to demand
pardon, he spurned her from him&mdash;upbraided her
with her disobedience and ingratitude&mdash;and warned
her, in a tone of solemnly prophetic meaning, that
her readiness to repose confidence in strangers
would bring down some terrible calamity on her
head. She was about to promise never more to
prove guilty of the disobedience which had elicited
all these reproaches and produced all that unwonted
harshness on her father’s part, when a
third person appeared on the scene;&mdash;and this third
person was her mother!</p>

<p>But this new dream which now visited the sleeping
maiden, was not of a tranquillising description.</p>

<p>She fancied that an earnest appeal was now made
to her on either side, placing her in the difficult and
most distressing condition of a child who had to
decide as to which of her parents she would
cling to, and which abandon. Here was her
father, reminding her of all he had done for her:
there was her mother, proclaiming herself to be
unhappy and to need the society and solace of her
daughter. On her right hand stood the sire whom
she had always known: on her left was the maternal
parent whom she had never known before.
The countenance of the former expressed misgivings
amounting almost to despair: that of the
latter was bathed in tears, and indicative of all the
agonies of a cruel suspense. Agnes felt that her
heart was rent by this scene; and yet it appeared
to her that she was bound to decide, and that
promptly, in one way or the other. She looked
towards her father; and he held out his arms to
receive her&mdash;his countenance assuming an expression
so profoundly wretched that it seemed to say,
“If I lose you, I lose all I love or care for on earth.”
She turned towards her mother, in order to breathe
a last farewell, for that she must accompany her
father,&mdash;when she beheld her maternal parent on
her knees, and extending her clasped hands imploringly,
while the pale but beauteous face indicated
that life or death was in the decision which
was about to be pronounced. Agnes could not
resist this earnest&mdash;silently eloquent appeal on the
part of a mother who had proclaimed herself to be
unhappy; and the maiden fancied that she threw
herself into that mother’s arms. A cry of misery
burst from her father’s lips; and Agnes awoke with
a wild start,&mdash;awoke, to feel her entire frame quaking
convulsively, and her heart palpitating with
alarming violence.</p>

<p>For a few moments&mdash;nay, for nearly a minute,
she lay stretched upon her back, endeavouring to
compel her thoughts to settle themselves in their
proper places, so that she might attain the assurance
whether she had just beheld realities, or had
only been the victim of distressing dreams;&mdash;and
when she was enabled to arrive at the latter conclusion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
she started up in her bed, exclaiming,
“Nevertheless, this is more than I can endure!”</p>

<p>Then came the consciousness of where she was,
and why she was there,&mdash;how she had fled from the
home that her father had provided for her, and in
spite of all his solemn injunctions and prudential
warnings,&mdash;how her mother had left her in a
strange place, and with persons who were strangers
to her,&mdash;and how Mrs. Gifford would be certain
to send to Paris without delay and communicate
the afflicting tidings to Mr. Vernon.</p>

<p>The maiden’s brain reeled, as these thoughts
flashed through it;&mdash;and at this moment, when her
senses appeared to be leaving her, the clock of
Christ Church, in the Blackfriars-road, proclaimed
the hour of <em>one</em>!</p>

<p>The sound came booming&mdash;rolling&mdash;vibrating
through the air, like a solemn warning: at least, so
it seemed to the disordered fancy of Agnes Vernon;&mdash;and,
with feelings worked up to an intolerable
pitch, she leapt from her couch.</p>

<p>To obtain a light was an easy matter&mdash;for the
necessary materials were at hand; and when the
flame burst from the tip of the lucifer match,
Agnes cast a hurried and affrighted glance around,
as if she dreaded to meet some hideous countenance
or horrible form in the chamber. Not that she was
naturally timid: no&mdash;far from it;&mdash;her very innocence
and purity rendered her courageous on ordinary
occasions. But she was now under the influence
of emotions powerfully wrung&mdash;of feelings
strained to an unusual tension;&mdash;and she had no
control over her imagination, which was disordered
and excited.</p>

<p>One idea dominated all the rest. This was to
escape from the house&mdash;to escape, at any hazard
and at all risks. Not for worlds, she thought,
could she return to that bed where such distressing
visions had rent her soul;&mdash;and she could not
pass the rest of the night alone, and in a strange
place. No: she must return to the cottage&mdash;retrace
her way to the home which her father had
provided for her&mdash;and endeavour to reach that
friendly threshold in time to prevent Mrs. Gifford
from transmitting to her sire the news of her disobedience.</p>

<p>But her mother! Oh! she should see that
parent again&mdash;she would explain everything&mdash;and
perhaps arrangements might be made to suit the
views and accomplish the happiness of all! In
the mean time, however, she must escape&mdash;she must
return home,&mdash;she could not endure the idea of remaining
another hour&mdash;no&mdash;nor even a minute
longer than was necessary&mdash;in that stranger-dwelling!</p>

<p>With lightning speed did all these thoughts,&mdash;or
rather glimpses of thoughts&mdash;for they were too
brief, too fleetingly vivid, to deserve the name of
reflections&mdash;pass through the maiden’s mind, as
she threw on her apparel with a congenial haste;
and in three minutes she was dressed. Her bonnet
was in the parlour below: but that she could take
on her way out of the house&mdash;or she cared not if
she did not find it at all. She would escape in any
case, and at all events; and if she could not find a
vehicle to convey her home&mdash;she would walk, although
she might have to ask her way at every step.
For Agnes had worked herself up to a pitch of desperation:
a fearful panic was upon her;&mdash;she knew
not, neither did she pause to ask in her own soul,
why she longed so ardently to fly from that house:&mdash;an
irresistible and almost incomprehensible influence
urged her on&mdash;and the hurry of her actions
was in accordance with the hurry of her brain.</p>

<p>Her hair was flowing over her shoulders: she
just waited a moment&mdash;a single moment, to fasten
it up in a large knot behind; and then, taking the
light in her hand, she stole noiselessly down the
stairs.</p>

<p>A profound silence&mdash;a silence which her footsteps
disturbed not&mdash;reigned throughout the house.</p>

<p>All, save the affrighted&mdash;half-maddened girl,
slept.</p>

<p>She gained the hall&mdash;she endeavoured to enter
the parlour to procure her bonnet: but the door
was closed&mdash;and she now remembered that the elder
Miss Theobald had taken the key with her when
they had all quitted that room for the night.</p>

<p>But we have already said that Agnes cared not
for the bonnet;&mdash;and without bestowing a second
thought on the matter, she approached the front-door.
Alas! there was a more serious disappointment
still&mdash;the key of that door had likewise been
taken up stairs.</p>

<p>An expression of bitter vexation passed over the
pale countenance of the maiden&mdash;an expression
more bitter than that beauteous countenance had
ever before worn: but, in another instant, it was
succeeded by something like a gleam of hope and
joy,&mdash;for Agnes bethought her that there was a
yard at the back of the house&mdash;she had seen it, in
the moonlight, from her bed-room window&mdash;and
there might be a means of egress in that direction.</p>

<p>Cautiously descending the stairs leading into the
kitchens, which were below the level of the street,
she hastened to the back-door, which, to her joy,
proved only to be bolted.</p>

<p>Oh! now she would escape&mdash;she would escape,
even if she were forced to climb a wall and enter
the enclosure belonging to a neighbouring house:
for, with the excitement occasioned by her present
proceedings, the panic influence which urged her
on acquired fresh power every moment.</p>

<p>Extinguishing the light, she left the candlestick
in the house, and then emerged into the yard.</p>

<p>The fresh air, as it fanned her face, seemed to
breathe whispering promises of freedom, and gave
her renewed courage.</p>

<p>The moon was shining gloriously; and as she cast
a glance of rapid survey around, she beheld the
backs of the dilapidated houses the fronts of which
had struck her with such sinister effect when she
first entered Stamford Street, in the hackney-coach,
in the evening.</p>

<p>There was no mode of egress from the yard save
by scaling the boundary walls, which were low on
either side.</p>

<p>Not an instant did Agnes hesitate: the fittings
of a water-butt served as a ladder for her delicate
feet;&mdash;and, behold! the sylph-like form of the
maiden passes nimbly and lightly over the wall, into
the yard belonging to the ruined house next door:
for it strikes her that egress by means of an uninhabited
building must be certain beyond all risk or
doubt.</p>

<p>The moon-light streams, with silvery rays, upon
the sombre walls&mdash;the dark window-frames, with
the blackened fragments of glass remaining in them&mdash;the
back-door hanging crazily and loosely on its
hinges&mdash;and the rust-eaten bars of the back-kitchen
window. The yard is overgrown with rank grass,
reaching above the ankles; and the ground is ragged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
and uneven&mdash;the chances of tripping being moreover
multiplied by the brick-bats and the broken bottles
scattered about.</p>

<div id="i_273" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_273.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The ruined aspect of the house and the long-neglected
condition of the yard, or small garden as
it once was, behind the building, constituted a
scene of desolation, and conveyed an impression
of utter loneliness to the mind of the young lady
that made her shrink back for a moment as she
placed her hand on the rusty latch of the crazy
door leading into the lower premises. And seemed
she not the sprite of some maiden who had
been foully dealt with in that gloomy, tomb-like
place, and whose unquiet ghost came to haunt the
scene where her blood had been ruthlessly spilt
and her mortal remains lay concealed in unconsecrated
ground? Yes&mdash;such she indeed appeared,
with her ashy pale face&mdash;her white dress, rendered
whiter still by the moonbeams that played upon it&mdash;and
her long dark hair which, having become
loosened in the act of scaling the wall, now flowed
all wildly and dishevelled over her shoulders!</p>

<p>We said that she hesitated for a moment to push
her way into the dark and ruined building, wrapped
as it was in sepulchral silence: but the dominant
influence which had hitherto impelled her, asserted
its empire once again; and, thrusting open the
door, which was by no means a difficult matter&mdash;she
entered the dilapidated house.</p>

<p>A chill struck to her heart and a vague terror
seized upon her, as she now plunged, as it were,
out of the pure moonlight into the utter darkness
of those premises: but, subduing her fears, she advanced
a few paces, with her arms extended so as
to grope for the stairs.</p>

<p>Her right hand encountered the bannisters, which
were loose and crazy, and raised a rattling noise
as she grasped them: no longer alarmed, however,
but feeling that the means of escape were gained,
she was about to ascend the steps, when a door
suddenly opened immediately in front of her&mdash;a
light appeared&mdash;and the rays of the candle thus
abruptly thrust forth revealed a countenance so
hideous&mdash;so monster-like, that for a few moments
Agnes stood transfixed in speechless horror&mdash;stupified&mdash;paralysed&mdash;motionless
as a marble statue.</p>

<p>And glaring with horror also, were the eyeballs
whose rivetted looks met her own: then a loud,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
hoarse, and affrighted voice exclaimed, “The ghost!
the ghost!”&mdash;and the light, dropping suddenly on the
ground, was immediately extinguished.</p>

<p>A piercing shriek burst from the lips of Agnes;
and she fell senseless at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXV">CHAPTER CLXXV.<br />

<span class="medium">THE HAUNTED HOUSE IN STAMFORD STREET.</span></h2>

<p>We must now carry our narrative backward for a
few hours, in order to explain the incident which
has just been described.</p>

<p>At the corner of Stamford Street and the Blackfriars
Road, there are three houses in a most dismantled and
dilapidated condition. They seem to
have been ravaged by fire; but time and neglect
have in reality produced that deplorable appearance.
The walls are blackened with accumulated dirt;
and the state of the windows bears unequivocal evidence
to the fact that every pane has been broken,
individually and separately, by stones flung from the
streets by vagabond boys or other mischievous persons.
The fragments of glass that remain, seem as
if the material never could have been transparent,
but had even in its manufacture been stained with
an inky dye; and the shutters wherewith the casements
are closed inside, are equally blackened,
as if by a smoke as dense as that which proceeds
from the funnel of a steam-packet or the chimney
of a factory.</p>

<p>For the last twenty years have these three houses
been thus left to fall into ruin: for the fifth part of
a century has the work of dilapidation and decay
been going on! That they were once habited is
evident from the fact that the blinds, pulled up
round their rollers, still remain&mdash;but so begrimed
with black dust and dirt that it is scarcely possible
to believe they were ever white. The cords used to
pull them down, with the tassels at the end, are
likewise still there, and totally discoloured also.
Very mournful is the aspect of those ruined tenements,
with these indications that they once were
comfortable dwellings,&mdash;that cheerful fires once
burnt in the grates&mdash;that lights streamed from the
casements in years gone by&mdash;and that the walls
echoed to the gay pealing laughter of merry children!</p>

<p>Desolate&mdash;desolate, indeed, are the three houses,&mdash;a
disfigurement to the entire vicinity, and having an
appearance well calculated to throw a damp upon
the spirits even of the most strong-minded of the
neighbours.</p>

<p>There is something picturesque in the aspect
which ruins in the open country&mdash;perhaps on the
summit of a hill&mdash;assume from gradual decay; because
there the ivy grows upon the walls, and the
naked hideousness of dilapidation is concealed by
the invasion of a wilderness of shrubs and sweets.
But when the golden rays of a summer sun pour
upon the blackened walls and shattered casements
of houses in the midst of a populous city,&mdash;houses
which have dwelling-places adjoining them and all
around,&mdash;the effect is sombre, sad, and sinister in
the extreme.</p>

<p>Such is the impression produced by those three
houses in Stamford-street. Not that the street itself
is otherwise cheerful in aspect: on the contrary,
the entire thoroughfare stretching between
the Blackfriars and Waterloo Roads, is gloomy and
inhospitable in aspect. The exterior of the houses
has a dinginess of wall and a darkness of window
that are unrelieved by the aristocratic grandeur
and the richness of curtains inside, which characterise
the rows of smoke-dyed dwellings in
more fashionable quarters.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Stamford Street are amazingly
prone to the letting of lodgings, when they can find
any persons willing to take them. But that such
pliant and easily-persuaded tenants are rare in that
quarter, is proved to demonstration by the numbers
of cards and bills in the windows announcing furnished
apartments to let.</p>

<p>It is a curious study, and one that affords matter
for speculation, to examine the cards and bills thus
displayed. Some are written in a neat feminine
hand, so small that the passer-by must protrude his
head far over the railings to enable his vision to decipher
the delicate announcements: others are
penned in a bold, coarse hand&mdash;and, in them, the
chances are ten to one that the word <em>let</em> is spelt
with a double t;&mdash;while others, again, are printed
in the types which the experienced eye has no difficulty
in tracing to Peel’s famed establishment in
the New Cut.</p>

<p>More than half of Stamford Street constantly appears
to let; and, from all accounts, landlords experience
no trifling difficulty in collecting the rents
from the occupants of their houses. If you pass
along Stamford Street just before quarter-day, and
at a very early hour in the morning, or at a late hour
in the night, you will be sure to perceive several
vans loading with furniture; for the habit of
“moon-shining it,” or flitting surreptitiously, is
unfortunately of frequent occurrence in that district.</p>

<p>But these are not the only indications that the
affairs of the inhabitants and lodgers in Stamford
Street are far from being in the most blooming condition:
the fact may also be gathered from the careworn
countenance of the tax-gatherer as he leaves
a fresh notice at every door, and from the common
occurrence of the water being cut off. Nor less
does the Poor Rates’ collector feel his task to be a
most unpleasant one; while the tradesmen in the
Blackfriars Road wonder, as they look over their
ledgers, what the deuce Stamford Street is coming
to. Visitors are frequently answered from the area&mdash;an
unmistakeable precaution against the intrusion
of sheriff’s officers; and even when the butcher
delivers in his meat or the baker his bread at the
front door, the chain is in many instances kept up.</p>

<p>Such is the prevalent state of affairs in the long
thoroughfare which we have thus briefly described:
but it is with the dilapidated houses&mdash;or rather
with one of them&mdash;that we have now to occupy
ourselves.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dusk, two men emerged from
the miserable rookery constituted by the district of
Broad Wall; and, entering Stamford Street, they proceeded
stealthily along until they reached the ruined
house which was next to the dwelling of the Misses
Theobald. One of the men&mdash;a tall, stout, ruffian-like
fellow, whom we shall presently describe more
particularly&mdash;took a key from his pocket and opened
the door of the dilapidated tenement, into which he
hastily entered, his companion closely following
him. We should however observe that this ingress
was effected at a moment when no other persons
were near; and that the door was opened and shut
in a noiseless manner, so that no sound might
reach the ears of the occupants of the adjacent
dwelling.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>“Now give us your hand, old feller,” said the
ruffian-like individual, when they were safe inside
the passage: “because the stairs is summut broke
away, and the bannisters isn’t to be trusted. Lord!
how you tremble! Why&mdash;what the hell are you
afeard on?”</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;nothing, my good friend,” was the
answer, delivered in a nervous tone: “only&mdash;it’s&mdash;it’s&mdash;so&mdash;very&mdash;very&mdash;dark.”</p>

<p>“Dark!” cried the ruffian, with a hoarse laugh:
“why, it wery often <em>is</em> dark in a house at night-time,
and where there’s no candle alight. But
p’raps you’re afeard of ghosteses,” he continued, as
he dragged rather than led the nervous old man
down the crazy, rotting stairs towards the lower
region of the place: “and if so, you’re in the right
quarters to see a speret&mdash;for they do say the young
gal which was murdered here, walks in her shroud;&mdash;but,
for my part, I never see her&mdash;and I han’t
got no fear of that sort.”</p>

<p>By the time these words were uttered, in a tone
of coarse jocularity, the ruffian had conducted his
companion to the bottom of the stairs; and, halting
at that point, he struck a lucifer-match against the
wall, and lighted a piece of candle which he took
from his pocket.</p>

<p>He then led the way into the front kitchen of the
house, bidding the old man close the door behind
him.</p>

<p>The place was black all over with accumulated
dust and dirt: the ceiling appeared as if it had been
originally painted a sable hue; and the floor, broken
in several parts, conveyed the same impression. The
shelves above the dresser were in a most dilapidated
condition; and the dense cob-webs clung to them,
as well as to the corners of the ceiling, like masses
of rotten rags. The shutters were closed; and over
their entire surface were pasted sheets of thick
brown paper&mdash;evidently to prevent the light of
candles from peeping through their chinks and
being noticed in the street. There was an old
ricketty table in the middle of the kitchen: there
were likewise two chairs, which, being made of a
tough wood, had withstood the ravages of time; and
an empty beer-barrel was placed upright near the
table, as if it occasionally served as a third seat.</p>

<p>The ruffian stuck the candle in the neck of a
bottle; and, opening one of the dresser-drawers,
he drew forth a bottle and a couple of small tumblers:&mdash;then,
placing himself on the barrel, he proceeded
in a leisurely manner to light his pipe, while
the old man&mdash;his companion&mdash;sank, nervous and
trembling, into one of the Windsor-chairs.</p>

<p>The reader has no doubt already guessed that
these two individuals were Vitriol Bob and Torrens;&mdash;and,
if so, the surmise is correct.</p>

<p>The latter person needs no description; but the
former character must be more elaborately dealt
with on the present occasion. He was indeed, as
Jack Rily had represented him, one of the greatest
miscreants that ever disgraced humanity,&mdash;not only
in reality, but also in personal appearance. Of tall
stature, athletic frame, and muscular build, he possessed
vast physical strength. He was about thirty-six
years of age: his countenance was naturally
ugly even to repulsiveness&mdash;but huge black whiskers
meeting under his chin, rendered it positively ferocious;&mdash;and
the small, dark, reptile-like eyes glared
from beneath thick, overhanging brows. His lips
were remarkably coarse and of a livid hue; and his
nose, broken in the middle, had a deep indentation,
giving an appearance of death’s-head flatness to the
broad countenance. His apparel consisted of a
seedy suit of black&mdash;a hat with very wide brims
bent even to slouching&mdash;and a pair of heavy Wellington
boots; and in his hand he carried a thick
stick with a huge nob at one end and a massive ferrule
at the other. This was his “life-preserver;”
but he seldom had occasion to use it&mdash;for his proceedings
were usually of the savage and diabolical
nature described by the Doctor, and whence he derived
the appellation of <em>Vitriol Bob</em>.</p>

<p>This terrible individual was well known to the
police: but those functionaries trembled at the
idea of molesting him. They would have experienced
no such dread had his defensive weapons
been confined to life-preservers or pistols: but
there was something so horrible in the thought of
having a bottle of burning, blinding fluid broken
over the countenance, that the officers shuddered at
the bare idea of tackling Vitriol Bob. Thus, whenever
information was given of some nefarious deed
which he had attempted or perpetrated, the police
took very good care to search for him where they
knew he was not to be found; and if they even met
him in one of the bye-streets or obscure alleys on
the Surrey side of the metropolis&mdash;the quarter
which he chiefly honoured with his presence&mdash;they
were suddenly seized with an inclination to look
stedfastly into a picture-shop, or gaze up abstractedly
at the sky, until he had passed.</p>

<p>Vitriol Bob knew that he was an object of terror
to the functionaries of justice in general: but he
was also well aware that there were exceptions to
the rule, and that amongst so large a body as the
police-force, some few individuals would pounce
upon him at all risks. In fact, the impunity he
enjoyed was not so completely assured as to render
precaution unnecessary; and there was moreover
such a thing as being taken by surprise. For these
reasons he accordingly made use of one of the
“haunted houses,”&mdash;for so they were denominated,&mdash;as
a place of concealment whenever he had committed
a deed calculated to lead to the institution
of unpleasant enquiries.</p>

<p>Such was the individual whom we now find in
company with Torrens; and the circumstance that
threw them together in the first instance, will presently
transpire through the medium of the conversation
that took place as soon as they were
seated in the kitchen of the haunted house.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are safe at last, old feller,” cried
Vitriol Bob, puffing deliberately at his pipe, as if he
savoured deliciously the soothing influences of the
tobacco. “By goles! it is one of the best larks I
ever was engaged in. Such a lot of tin, and so
easily got!”</p>

<p>“Two thousand seven hundred a piece&mdash;eh?”
said Torrens, eyeing his companion with nervous
suspense, as if he were eager to assure himself
that a fair and equitable division of the booty would
take place.</p>

<p>“Hah!” observed the ruffian, in a complacent
manner, as he filled the two tumblers with brandy
from the black bottle: “drink!”&mdash;and he emptied
one of the glasses at a draught, just as if it were a
mere thimble-full of the fiery liquid. “It was a
good job, old feller,” he continued, after a short
pause, “that you fell in with such a prime chap as
I am&mdash;or rayther, it was fortnit that I lodged in the
same house, and as I came in heard you moaning
and groaning away in your cellar. It was also lucky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
that you let me worm out of you all that had happened&mdash;although
you was precious chary of making
a confidant of me. You remember that I couldn’t
believe you at fust&mdash;I looked on you as a perfect
madman. Thinks I to myself, ‘<em>There’s a precious
lu-nattic just ’scaped out of Bedlam</em>:’ for how was I
to fancy that you’d raly been robbed of such an
amount, living in a cellar as you was!”</p>

<p>“But you believed me at last&mdash;you saw that it was
all true and correct,” exclaimed Torrens, perceiving
that it suited the man’s humour to talk on the
subject.</p>

<p>“Well, I did,” returned Vitriol Bob: “and now,”
he added, tapping his breeches pockets significantly,
“I have got plenty of proof that you didn’t tell no
lies. But, Lord bless ye! you could have done nothink
without me: you would have sat down quietly
under your loss. But I told you that I’d find the
old voman out, if so be she was in London at all;
and so I did. The description you gave me of her
was not to be mistaken&mdash;’specially by a genelman
of eggs-sperience like myself. I went about all over
London, looking for her; and then, behold ye! arter
all she’s living within a stone’s throw of us, as one
may say. By goles! I never shall forget how my
heart jumped in my buzzim when I clapped eyes on
her yesterday, as she came out of the coffee-house:
but you don’t know how I found out that she actiwaliy
lived there?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I do not,” said Torrens, observing that his
companion bent upon him a look of mysterious importance,
as much as to invite a query that should
furnish him with the opportunity of giving an explanation
relative to the point alluded to. “How
did it happen, then?”</p>

<p>“Why, when I see the old voman come out of the
coffee-house, I went straight away to my blewen&mdash;that’s
Pig-faced Polly, as she’s called&mdash;and I tells
her to go to the place, take tea and toast, and wait
till she found out whether the old voman lived
there, or not. But I orders Polly not to make inquiries,
for fear of eggs-citing suspicion. Well, my
gal did as I told her&mdash;and waited, and waited a good
long time; and when she’d had three teas and four
or five buttered toastesses, she see the old voman
come in, and she hears the landlady come out and
say, ‘<em>Here’s your key, Mrs. Mortimer</em>.’ Then up goes
Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;for such her name seems to be&mdash;to
her room; and Pig-faced Poll returns to me with
the hintelligence. I knowed that my game was now
safe enough; and it was me which dewised the
plan of our going as officers with a search-warrant,
when we’d watched the old voman leave the coffee-house
this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: I know that you did it all,” said
Torrens, terribly alarmed lest he who experienced
the lion’s share of the trouble, should now claim
the lion’s share of the booty. “But how long shall
we be obliged to remain here? I am in a hurry
to get away&mdash;with my share&mdash;my fair share of my
own money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your own money, indeed!” ejaculated Vitriol
Bob, with a chuckling laugh. “Was it your’n when
Mother Mortimer had it safe in her own box? And
I should just like to know how you fust come by
it? Not honestly, I’ll swear, old feller. Such a
seedy-looking cove, living in such a way as you
was, couldn’t have got near upon six thousand
pound by wot’s called legitimate means. But that’s
neether here nor there: I don’t care two figs how
you got the tin&mdash;and if I ask no questions, I shan’t
have no lies told me. Von thing is wery certain&mdash;that
I’ve got it now.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;you surely&mdash;my dear friend&mdash;you&mdash;”
stammered Torrens, absolutely aghast at the idea, of
still remaining a beggar.</p>

<p>“Come, let’s have no more of this drivelling nonsense,”
interrupted Vitriol Bob, in a tone of unmitigated
contempt: then, as he refilled and relighted
his pipe, be observed, “Why, you have been
in a fidget and a stew all day, ever since we secured
the swag at the coffee-house. Don’t you see, my
dear feller, that people in our sitiwations must act
with somethink like common prudence? The old
voman may rouse hell’s delight about her loss;
and that was why I thought we’d better keep ourselves
scarce for a time. So I made you stay close
with me at the flash lodging-ken in the Mint all
the arternoon till it was dusk; and then I brought
you here. And here,” added Vitriol Bob, “we are
safe enow: ’cos only Pig-faced Poll, Jack Rily, and
one or two others of my pals knows anythink
about this place being my haunt when I’m afeard
of getting into trouble;&mdash;and there’s no danger of
them splitting on us. So far from that, the Pig-faced
will be sure to come here presently, when
she finds I don’t wisit her own quarters this evening;
and she’ll bring a basket of prog along with
her&mdash;so that we shall have a jolly good supper in
due time. Drink, old feller!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the ruffian refilled his own tumbler,
and pushed the brandy bottle across the dirty
table to Torrens, who did not, however, touch it&mdash;for
his glass was only half emptied; and he experienced
such lively sensations of alarm, that he felt
as if his brain were reeling and his intellects were
leaving him.</p>

<p>There he was&mdash;a feeble, helpless, weak old man,
entirely in the power of an individual whom he
knew to be of the most desperate character, but
with whom he had joined in companionship only
through the hope of recovering at least one-half of
that treasure to gain which, in the first instance,
he had imbrued his hands in blood. There he was&mdash;alone
with that miscreant, in a place the aspect
of which was sufficient to fill his attenuated soul
with the gloomiest thoughts and the most melancholy
forebodings,&mdash;alone with a demon in human
shape, in a ruined and desolate tenement, to augment
the cheerless influence of which superstition
had lent its aid,&mdash;alone with a very fiend, in a haunt
the ominous features of which were dimly shadowed
forth and rendered more hideous by the dull, glimmering
light of the solitary candle with its long
wick and its sickly flame.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what are you thinking of?&mdash;and why
don’t you drink?” were the words which, suddenly
falling on the old man’s ears after a pause, awoke
him as it were from a lethargy&mdash;a lethargy, however,
in which the mind had been painfully active,
though the body was motionless&mdash;petrified!</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;was wondering how long we should have
to remain here,” stammered Torrens, starting as if
shaken by a strong spasm or moved by an electric
shock.</p>

<p>“I asked you the question just now&mdash;and&mdash;and
you did not give me a reply.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;it all depends, my fine feller,” answered
Vitriol Bob. “Three or four days, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Three or four days!” almost shrieked Torrens.
“I shall die if I linger so long in this horrible
place!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>“Die, indeed!” ejaculated the ruffian, in a contemptuous
tone. “Why, Lord bless you&mdash;I’ve
stayed here for three veeks at a time, afore now&mdash;without
ever budging out. Not be able to linger,
as you call it, in this comfortable crib&mdash;smoke and
drink all day long&mdash;or drink only, if you don’t like
smoking&mdash;and sleep in one of them Windsor-cheers
as cozie as a bug in a rug! Besides, won’t you
have me for a companion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no: I can not&mdash;will not endure it!” exclaimed
Torrens, starting up from his chair,&mdash;his
countenance hideous with its workings&mdash;his nerves
strung to the most painful state of tension&mdash;and a
thousand frightful thoughts rushing in, with the
speed and fury of a torrent, upon his appalled
soul.</p>

<p>“Hold your cursed jaw, you fool!” growled
Vitriol Bob, in a tone of sudden rage: “you will
be heard in the street&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I care not!” screamed Torrens, louder than
before. “Give me my share of the money&mdash;let me
depart&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, I say!” spoke the ruffian, in a still
more irritated voice, while he sprang from his seat
on the barrel; “or I shall do you a mischief.”</p>

<p>“I care not!” again cried Torrens&mdash;and again
his tone grew still more piercing and shriekingly
hysterical; for he was wrought up to a state of
utter despair. “Give me my money, I say&mdash;give
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fool&mdash;be still!” exclaimed Vitriol Bob, rushing
round the table, and grasping the old man by the
throat.</p>

<p>But Torrens, inspired with a sudden strength
that astonished the ruffian, broke away from his
gripe, and rushed towards the door, crying “Murder&mdash;murder!”</p>

<p>“Damnation!” thundered Bob; and bounding
after him, he sprang upon the old man with the
fury and the force of a tiger.</p>

<p>“Murder!” again yelled the affrighted, desperate
Torrens: but in another instant he was dashed
violently against the wall.</p>

<p>A moan succeeded his agonising cry&mdash;and he fell
heavily upon the floor. Vitriol Bob then jumped
upon him&mdash;and the attenuated form of the wretched
old man writhed beneath the heavy feet of the
murderous ruffian.</p>

<p>There was a faint and stifling appeal for “Mercy!
mercy!”&mdash;but the miscreant silenced it with a
ferocious stamp of his heel on the mouth of the
dying man;&mdash;and in a few moments all was over!</p>

<p>Vitriol Bob was now alone, in the gloomy, cheerless
place, with the crushed and disfigured corpse of him
whom he had literally trampled to death.</p>

<p>But scarcely was the deed accomplished, when a
noise, as of gravel thrown from the street against
the kitchen window, fell upon the ears of the
murderer, whose countenance instantly expanded
into an expression of grim delight at the well-known
signal.</p>

<p>“Here’s Pig-faced Poll!” he exclaimed hastily:
and then he paused to listen again.</p>

<p>At the expiration of about a minute the signal
was repeated; and Vitriol Bob, no longer harbouring
the slightest doubt, hurried up the stairs to
open the street-door.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXVI">CHAPTER CLXXVI.<br />

<span class="medium">SCENES IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE.</span></h2>

<p>At five-and-twenty minutes past ten, on this
eventful night, Mrs. Mortimer entered the narrow
lane leading from the Blackfriars Road into Collingwood
Street.</p>

<p>We have already stated that she had persuaded
herself into a belief of Jack Rily’s fidelity towards
his partner or pal in any enterprise: nevertheless,
she could not help wishing that the business in
hand was over&mdash;and she mentally exclaimed more
than once, as she threaded the lane, “Would that
to-morrow morning were come!” But she had
such a powerful inducement to proceed in the affair
at any risk, that the idea of retreating was discarded
each time it faintly suggested itself; and
when Jack Rily made his appearance, punctually to
an instant, she felt her courage worked up to such
a pitch that it was difficult to decide whether it
arose from entire confidence or utter desperation.</p>

<p>“So, here you are, my fine old tiger-cat,” said
the doctor, grasping her hand, with a force that
might have been very friendly, but was not the less
painful on that account. “I thought you would not
flinch: indeed, I made sure you’d come to the
scratch.”</p>

<p>“What have I to be afraid of&mdash;since you are so
sure of being able to overpower the wretch whom
you call Vitriol Bob!” demanded Mrs. Mortimer,
in a firm tone. “I have already told you that I will
undertake to manage the villain Torrens.”</p>

<p>“I long to see you grapple with him,” returned
the doctor. “But we must not waste time in idle
observations. Listen, my good lady, to our plan of
proceeding. Vitriol Bob has a female acquaintance
called Molly Calvert&mdash;or, in more familiar terms,
Pig-faced Poll. This young woman knows his
haunt&mdash;knows also the signals necessary to induce
him to open the door. Besides, whenever he’s missing,
she goes straight there, with a basket of provisions
and what not&mdash;because she naturally suspects
that he has done something queer and has found it
convenient to make himself scarce. Well&mdash;you
must be Pig-faced Poll for the nonce&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand you,” interrupted Mrs. Mortimer.
“It is for me to give the signal and obtain admission&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just so, my dear madam&mdash;and for us both&mdash;because
if ever Molly Calvert and I go there together,
it’s always the young woman herself who whispers
a word of assurance to Vitriol Bob when he opens
the door.”</p>

<p>“But suppose that the young woman you speak
of, has already repaired to the robber’s haunt&mdash;suppose
that she is already with him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now don’t take Jack Rily for an arrant fool!”
said the ruffian; and, dark though it were in the
narrow lane where this colloquy took place, Mrs.
Mortimer could see the huge white teeth of her
companion gleaming through the opening of his
horrid hare-lip. “I know what I am about,” he continued.
“Lord bless you! do you think I have been
idle since I saw you this morning? No such thing!
I went straight away to Molly Calvert, and made her
send out for a bottle of gin. She is uncommonly fond
of blue ruin&mdash;particularly when she drinks at another
person’s expense; and as she drank this afternoon
at mine, she did not spare it. In a word, I left her
in such a helpless state of intoxication, that if she
moves off her bed before two or three o’clock in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
morning, then tell Jack Rily he is a fool and incapable
of managing any business whatsoever.”</p>

<p>“I give you all possible credit for sagacity and
forethought,” said Mrs. Mortimer, purposely flattering
the ruffian. “Well, then, the young woman you
speak of is placed in a condition which will render
her incapable of interfering with our proceedings;
and I must personate her for a moment or two, just
to obtain admission into the home.”</p>

<p>“<em>Personate her</em> is scarcely the term, my dear
madam,” answered Jack Rily: “because if Vitriol
Bob only caught a glimpse of you by the neighbouring
lamp-light, he would know deuced well that it
was not the Pig-faced who sought admission. But
it is a mere matter of <em>vocal stratagem</em>, if you understand
me.”</p>

<p>“Speak plainly and briefly,” said Mrs. Mortimer,
with some degree of sharpness in her tone.</p>

<p>“I will put it all into a nut-shell,” responded
Jack Rily: then, with rapid utterance but impressive
enunciation, he continued:&mdash;“The first signal
is made by throwing a little gravel at a certain window;
but, as that might be accidental, it is necessary
to repeat it at the expiration of a minute or so.
In a few seconds afterwards Vitriol Bob will open
the front door as far as the chain inside will permit&mdash;and
that is barely an inch: you must then immediately
whisper, ‘<em>It’s me and the Doctor</em>,’ and the
door will be instantly opened wide, Bob standing
behind it. You pass rapidly in&mdash;and I’m at your
heels; and as the passage and the stairs leading
down to the kitchen are as dark as pitch, he won’t
observe that it is <em>not</em> Molly Calvert whom he has
admitted into the house. Now, mind, you must
walk straight along the passage, and gain the stairs&mdash;and
all this without any hesitation, but with an
apparent knowledge of the premises. Go rapidly
down the stairs, and you will then see a light straight
before you. That will be in the front kitchen&mdash;and
there you are certain to find Torrens. Spring upon
him&mdash;tackle him desperately: there will not be a
minute to lose&mdash;because the moment you appear in
his presence, he will recognise you&mdash;he will utter a
cry&mdash;and that must be the signal for the fight.
Vitriol Bob will be just behind me&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You will assail him at the instant that I pounce
upon Torrens?” said the old woman, with a bitter
malignity in her tone, as she already gloated in anticipation
upon the vengeance which she hoped to
wreak upon her husband.</p>

<p>“Perform your part, ma’am&mdash;do all I have told
you,” observed Jack Rily; “and leave the rest to
me. And now are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” was the reply. “In which direction do
we proceed?”</p>

<p>“The house is in Stamford Street,” answered the
Doctor. “But you had now better follow me at a
short distance.”</p>

<p>With these words, the man turned round, and
proceeded along the narrow lane into the Blackfriars
Road, up which he wended his way until he
reached the corner of Stamford Street, where he
looked back to satisfy himself that Mrs. Mortimer
was in his track. He beheld her, by the light of
the lamps, at a short distance behind; and, turning
into Stamford Street, he was duly followed by her.
Halting for a moment, he stooped down, gathered
a few small pebbles from the side of the road joining
the kerb-stone, and threw them at a window in
the area of the dilapidated house which stood third
from the corner. He then walked on a few paces,
picked up some more little stones and hard crusted
dirt, and turning back, met Mrs. Mortimer just opposite
the house alluded to. The second volley was
discharged at the window; and then they both stationed
themselves at the door of the tenement, Mrs.
Mortimer being placed in the most convenient position
to give an answer to any summons that might
issue from within.</p>

<p>The door was opened an inch or two; and the old
woman, feigning the tone of a younger female,
whispered hastily, “It’s me and the Doctor.”
Thereupon the chain fell inside, and the door was
opened half-way, Vitriol Bob standing behind it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer passed hastily in, followed by Jack
Rily; and Vitriol Bob, closing the door noiselessly,
readjusted the chain.</p>

<p>“Take care, Poll,” he said, in a hoarse and low
tone: “don’t be in such a devil of a hurry to get
down them stairs&mdash;’cos there’s somethink in the
door-way of the kitchen that you might stumble
over.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Bob?” demanded Jack Rily, hastily;
for inasmuch as the real truth flashed to his mind
in an instant, he feared lest Mrs. Mortimer should
likewise suspect the fact, and, being thrown off her
guard, betray herself by some sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>“What is it?&mdash;why, a stiff ’un,” responded Vitriol
Bob, with a chuckling laugh which sounded horribly
in the midst of the total darkness that prevailed
in the passage and on the stairs. “I s’pose Poll has
let you into the business, since you’ve come along
with her,” continued the man; “and though I
don’t see what right she had to tell you anythink
about it, I ain’t sorry you have come&mdash;’cos you can
help me to bury the old feller, and you shall have
your reglars.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer now fully comprehended that
Torrens had been murdered; and an appalling dread
seized upon her&mdash;for she felt that she was completely
in the power of two diabolical ruffians, who
were as capable of assassinating her as one had
already been to make away with her husband.</p>

<p>A faintness came over her&mdash;and she staggered
against the wall for support; when Jack Rily, in
answer to Vitriol Bob’s last observations, said,
“Oh! Poll didn’t tell me a single word about any
business that you had in hand: but as I met her
quite by accident and suspected she was coming
here, I forced myself, as one may say, upon her
company&mdash;for I thought you’d be glad to see an
old pal, if you was under a cloud.”</p>

<p>These words instantaneously re-assured Mrs.
Mortimer. She comprehended that her confederate
had uttered them, too, for that purpose; and it
flashed to her mind that he only wanted to get
Vitriol Bob down into the lower part of the house
in order to make an attack upon him. She accordingly
recovered her self-possession, and rapidly
groped her way to the bottom of the stairs, when
a feeble light, glimmering from the kitchen, showed
her a sinister object lying just inside the threshold.</p>

<p>The blood ran cold in her veins: for, much as
she had hated Torrens&mdash;anxiously as she had
longed to be avenged upon him&mdash;profoundly as she
abhorred the tie that to some degree had linked their
fates, she nevertheless felt horrified at the conviction
that the murdered man lay there&mdash;in her very
path!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she still maintained her courage
as well as she could, and, hastily passing the lifeless
form, entered the cheerless, gloomy kitchen, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
indeed appeared to be the proper haunt for such a
miscreant as Vitriol Bob, and the fitting scene for
such a tragedy as the one which had been enacted
there that night!</p>

<p>In the middle of the kitchen she paused, and
listened with breathless suspense.</p>

<p>Jack Rily had just reached the bottom of the
stairs leading thither: Vitriol Bob had only just
begun to descend them.</p>

<p>“Well, here is indeed a stiff ’un,” exclaimed the
former, stopping short in the interval between the
foot of the steps and the threshold of the kitchen.
“What had he done to you, Bob?&mdash;and when did
this happen?”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment&mdash;and I’ll tell you all about it,”
was the reply. “I hope Poll has brought lots of
grub&mdash;for the business hasn’t taken away my appetite.”</p>

<p>“She has got a basket with her,” said Jack Rily.</p>

<p>At this moment Vitriol Bob reached the bottom
of the stairs, when the Doctor sprang upon him
with the sudden violence of a savage monster; and
the murderer was thrown back on the steps.</p>

<p>“Treachery!” he exclaimed, in a tone resembling
the subdued roar of a wild beast irritated by its
keeper; and the two men were locked in a close
embrace&mdash;a deadly struggle immediately commencing.</p>

<p>A mortal terror struck to the heart of Mrs.
Mortimer, who knew full well that if her confederate
should succumb, her own life would not
be worth a moment’s purchase; and for upwards of
a minute she stood rivetted to the spot, listening to
the sounds of the conflict which she could not see.</p>

<p>Suddenly it struck her that she might aid her
companion; and, taking from beneath her shawl a
coil of rope with which she had intended to bind
Torrens, whom she had made certain of subduing,
she rushed to the scene of the struggle.</p>

<p>The gleam of light that reached that place, was
sufficient, feeble though it were, to show her that
Vitriol Bob had the advantage. He had succeeded
in getting uppermost; and Jack Rily was struggling
desperately underneath the man whose
strength he had miscalculated. The conflict was
thus progressing, accompanied by deep, low, but
bitter execrations, when Mrs. Mortimer, whom a
sense of danger suddenly restored to complete self-possession,
threw a noose round Vitriol Bob’s neck,
and instantly drew it tight,&mdash;exclaiming, as she
performed this rapid and well-executed feat,
“Courage, Rily,&mdash;courage: grasp him firmly&mdash;loosen
not your hold!”</p>

<p>“Damnation!” ejaculated Vitriol Bob, the moment
he felt the cord upon his neck and heard a strange
female voice,&mdash;at the same time making a desperate&mdash;nay,
almost superhuman effort to tear himself
away from his foe and turn round on his new
enemy.</p>

<p>But the woman drew the cord as tight as she
could, and a sense of faintness came suddenly over
the murderer,&mdash;so that Jack Rily was in another
instant enabled to get uppermost once more.</p>

<p>“Tie his legs, old lady&mdash;and then we’ve nothing
more to fear!” cried he, as he placed one knee on
Vitriol Bob’s chest, and held the vanquished ruffian’s
wrists firmly with the iron grasp of his sinewy
hands. “Now, keep quiet, old fellow&mdash;or you’ll be
strangled,” he continued, addressing himself to the
wretch whose eyes glared savagely up at him even
amidst the obscurity of the place: “It’s useless to
resist&mdash;you are my prisoner,&mdash;and if it’s necessary
to make you safer still, I’ll draw my clasp-knife
across your throat&mdash;which I should be sorry to do,
on account of old acquaintanceship.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what have I done to you&mdash;Jack&mdash;to&mdash;to
deserve this?” gasped Vitriol Bob, half strangled
with the noose, which, however, was now somewhat
relaxed in consequence of Mrs. Mortimer being occupied
in tying the other end of the rope round his
ankles&mdash;a task which she performed with amazing
skill and rapidity, and which, in consequence of
Rily’s menaces, the vanquished one did not think it
prudent to resist.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you presently what you have done, Bob,”
said the Doctor, in answer to the other’s query.
“Now that you are bound neck and heels, you are
not very formidable: nevertheless, I must just make
your arms secure&mdash;and then we’ll hold a parley.
Here, old lady&mdash;put your hand in the pocket on
the right side of my coat, and give me out the cord
you’ll find there. That’s right! Come&mdash;be steady,
Bob&mdash;or I shall do you a mischief yet.”</p>

<p>The conqueror then proceeded to bind the wrists
of the vanquished; and when this was done, he said,
“Now, my fine fellow, I will just carry you into
the kitchen; and if there is any brandy there, you
shall have a drop to wash the dust out of your
mouth.”</p>

<p>With these words, Jack Rily raised Vitriol Bob
in his arms, and bore him into the kitchen, where
he placed him on a chair; and the murderer now
perceived for the first time that the female who had
mainly contributed to his defeat, was the one whom
himself and Torrens had robbed.</p>

<p>Jack Rily, on examining the bottle which he
found upon the table, discovered that there was
plenty of liquor left in it; and, filling a tumbler, he
placed it to the lips of Vitriol Bob, who greedily
swallowed the contents&mdash;for his throat was indeed
parched with the dust raised by the late struggle
and the semi-strangulation he had endured.</p>

<p>“Now, my hyena friend&mdash;my tiger-cat accomplice,”
said the Doctor, turning towards Mrs. Mortimer,
who, exhausted in mind and body, had sunk into
a chair, “you will likewise partake of the stimulant.
And mark you, madam,” he added, with deep
emphasis, and in a tone that was particularly re-assuring
to the old woman, “I owe you my life&mdash;and,
whatever my intentions concerning you originally
were, I can only now say that I’ll do all that’s
fair and honourable towards you. But enough of
that: so, drink!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer, greatly delighted at the result of
the night’s expedition, smiled as cordially as her
repulsive countenance would permit; but Jack Rily
surveyed her with much admiration, for she reminded
him at the moment of a pleased hyena after a copious
meal. His satisfaction was enhanced by the readiness
with which she tossed off the burning fluid;
and, taking his turn with the brandy, he drank to
her health.</p>

<p>“Now to business once more!” he exclaimed, as
he set the glass upon the table. “And first, where’s
the money, Bob?” he demanded turning towards
the helpless ruffian, who sat moody and scowling
in the chair in which be had been placed.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean to let me have my reglars,
Jack?” he said, in a tone which he endeavoured to
render as conciliatory and agreeable as possible.</p>

<p>“Not a blessed halfpenny, Bob&mdash;and that’s flat,”
responded the Doctor, as he plunged his hands into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
the pockets of his prisoner. “Ah! here’s the swag&mdash;and
a precious heavy parcel it is too!” he exclaimed,
after a few moments’ pause, and in a joyous
tone. “My dear madam,” continued the villain,
handing the brown paper packet to Mrs. Mortimer,
“count it over&mdash;see that it’s right&mdash;and divide its
contents equally. You may as well be satisfied at
once that I mean to do what is right towards you&mdash;and
then, may be, you will think seriously of the
propriety of our clubbing our fortunes together, and
setting up as a gentleman and lady living on our
means&mdash;that is, you know, as Mr. and Mrs. Rily.”</p>

<p>All the latter portion of this long sentence was
lost&mdash;entirely lost upon Mrs. Mortimer: for the
moment that her hands grasped the brown paper
parcel&mdash;that parcel which was so significantly
weighty&mdash;her whole attention was absorbed in the
task of examining its contents. She placed it upon
the table; and, by the dim flickering light of the
miserable candle, she counted the yellow pieces&mdash;turned
over the soiled notes&mdash;and carefully reckoned
up the whole,&mdash;exclaiming, at the completion of the
business, “It is all right, save in respect to a single
sovereign, which I dare say the rogues changed and
spent directly. Here is your share, Mr. Rily&mdash;and
I thank you much for your valuable aid.”</p>

<p>“You are the handsomest ogress I ever saw,
when you appear gloating over the recovered gold,”
said the Doctor. “If I could afford it, I would
actually and positively give you my portion just to
have the pleasure of contemplating your physiognomy
while you fingered it. But perhaps we may
have all things in common yet between you and
me.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the ruffian secured his share of
the spoil about his person&mdash;an example that
was immediately followed by Mrs. Mortimer
in respect to her division;&mdash;and all the while
Vitriol Bob sate looking on with a countenance of
the most demoniac ferocity. It was evident that,
could the wretch release himself from his bonds,
his rage would endow him with a strength calculated
to give matters quite another turn: but he
was helpless&mdash;powerless,&mdash;and this consciousness
of his enthralled predicament only rendered his
hatred the more savage against his successful enemies,
and made his longings for revenge the more
eager and also the more torturing on account of
their unavailing intensity.</p>

<p>“I will now tell you, Bob,” said Jack Rily, turning
towards him, “why I have played you this
trick&mdash;and you will acknowledge that it is only tit
for tat. You remember the swell’s crib we broke
into at Peckham? Well&mdash;you found a bag containing
a hundred and twenty sovereigns, in a
drawer&mdash;and you never mentioned a word about it
when we came to divide the plunder.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie&mdash;a damned lie!” ejaculated the villain,
ferociously.</p>

<p>“Say that again,” cried the Doctor, his hare-lip
becoming absolutely white with rage, while the scar
upon his cheek grew crimson,&mdash;“and I will cut
your throat from ear to ear. How could I invent
such a tale? But I saw the advertisement in the
papers about the robbery&mdash;I read that a bag containing
a hundred and twenty pounds in gold was
abstracted from a chest of drawers&mdash;and I well
remembered that you searched those drawers, and
afterwards assured me there was nothing in them
worth taking. I did not tell you that I had thus
become aware of your treachery, because I resolved
to be revenged some day or other. That day has now
arrived&mdash;and you have the consolation of knowing
that you have lost thousands in consequence of
your beggarly meanness respecting a paltry sixty
sovereigns, which was my share of the sum you
kept back.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;’sposing it is all as you say, Jack,” exclaimed
Vitriol Bob, assuming a humble and indeed
abject tone,&mdash;“ain’t you more than even with me
to-night? and won’t you let me have my reglars?
We shall then be good friends again.”</p>

<p>“I do not mean to give you one farthing of my
money&mdash;and I know this old lady won’t,” responded
the Doctor. “As to our being friends again, I care
not whether we become so, or whether we continue
enemies. You can’t do me so much harm as I can
you, Bob,” added Rily, in an impressive manner,
and without a particle of his usual coarse jocularity:
“for you have to-night done a deed that, if
known, would send you to the scaffold.”</p>

<p>A deadly pallor passed over the countenance of
the murderer; and he writhed in his chair with
mingled rage and terror.</p>

<p>“Now, my old hyena,” exclaimed the doctor, turning
towards Mrs. Mortimer, “I told you that you
should have a good opportunity of seeing Vitriol
Bob in all his hideousness. Which do you think is
the ugliest of the two&mdash;he or me?”</p>

<p>And he grinned so horribly with his hare-lip and
his gleaming teeth, that the old woman was for an
instant appalled by the fiendish, malignant joy that
caused his countenance thus to assume so frightful
an expression.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;you don’t like to pass an opinion upon
the matter,” he said, with a chuckling laugh: “may
be you think I am the ugliest of the two, and that
it would hurt my feelings to tell me so. Lord
bless you, my dear madam&mdash;a right down savage,
ferocious, revolting ugliness is a splendid subject for
admiration to my mind. The uglier people are&mdash;provided
it’s the right sort of ugliness&mdash;the handsomer
they are in my eyes. This may seem paradoxical&mdash;but
it’s the truth; and it’s on that principle
I am ready to marry you to-morrow, if you’ll
have me. However&mdash;think upon it: there’s no
hurry for your decision, my dear creature&mdash;pardon
me for being so familiar. And now I may as well
tell you that it was not my original intention to let
you have one penny piece of all that swag,” he continued,
after a few moments’ pause. “I had purposed
to make use of you in obtaining it&mdash;and then
self-appropriate it; because I didn’t look upon you
in the light of a pal with whom it was necessary to
keep faith. The moment, however, that you interfered
in the struggle just now, the case became suddenly
altered: you saved my life&mdash;and I wouldn’t
harm a hair of your head for all the world. So you
are quite welcome to take your departure at once if
you will: but I should esteem it a mark of confidence
if you’d remain here with me a few hours
longer&mdash;and I’ll tell you why.”</p>

<p>“Show me a good reason,and I shall not object,”
remarked Mrs. Mortimer, knowing that the man, in
spite of his conciliatory observations, had the power
to enforce, if he chose, what he seemed to ask as a
favour.</p>

<p>“I will explain myself,” resumed Jack Rily: then
glancing towards Vitriol Bob, he said, “Our friend
here must remain in that condition until I can send
Pig-faced Poll to release him from his bonds. It
would not be worth while to risk another conflict
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
by taking on ourselves the part of liberators. His
young woman shall therefore be entrusted with that
agreeable duty: but as she is drunk in bed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<div id="i_281" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_281.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Vitriol Bob uttered a sound resembling the savage
but subdued growl of a wild beast.</p>

<p>“As she is drunk in bed,” repeated Jack Rily,
with a chuckle, “she won’t be fit to undertake the
task until it’s pretty near daylight; and it would
not be safe to leave the poor devil alone here for so
many hours. I don’t seek his death; but he might
fall off his chair, tumble flat on his face, and not be
able to right himself&mdash;for it’s by no means an easy
thing to shift one’s position when bound neck and
heels like that. So remain with him I must and
will. His company will not, however, prove the
most agreeable after all that has occurred betwixt
us; and now you can guess why I ask you as a
favour to stay with me&mdash;say till two o’clock, when
we will take our departure and send Poll Calvert,
who will be sufficiently sober by that time, to cut his
cords.”</p>

<p>“I consent to remain here until two o’clock,” said
Mrs. Mortimer: “only&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And she glanced, with shuddering aversion, towards
the door.</p>

<p>“Ah! I understand you, my dear tiger-cat,” exclaimed
Jack Rily: “you don’t admire the presence
of the stiff ’un there. Lord bless you! if you’d only
been my wife when I was a doctor, you would have
become familiar enough with articles of that kind&mdash;aye,
and have thought nothing of shaking hands
with a resurrection man. But it’s all habit; and
so, since you would feel more comfortable if that
bundle over there was moved, I’ll just drag it into
the back kitchen&mdash;and our friend here will doubtless
amuse himself by burying it to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>Having thus delivered himself with characteristic
levity, the Doctor rose from the barrel whereon he
had been seated, and taking up the candle, proceeded
to transfer the dead body of Torrens from
the threshold of the door into the back kitchen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer was now left in the company of
the murderer, and in total darkness; and though
she knew that he was bound beyond a chance of
self-release, yet a cold shudder passed over her
frame, as she thought of what would be the consequences
were it possible for him to cast off the
strong cords that restrained him.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this reflection entered her mine,
when a voice&mdash;stealing, at it were, like the hiss of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
an invisible serpent through the utter darkness of
the place&mdash;smote upon her ear.</p>

<p>“Madam&mdash;Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;loosen the cord&mdash;and
I will give you half of what I shall then take from
that villain Rily!” were the earnest, hastily uttered
words that were thus suddenly whispered by the
murderer.</p>

<p>The old woman was so startled that she could
make no reply; and in another moment the light
reappeared.</p>

<p>She mechanically cast her eyes towards Vitriol
Bob; and the returning glimmer fell upon a
countenance infuriate with rage, disappointment,
and renewed spite;&mdash;but she did not think it worth
while to mention to the Doctor the treacherous
proposal that had been made to her during his
temporary absence.</p>

<p>“I have put the corpse in the back kitchen,”
said Rily, resuming his seat on the barrel: then,
after a few moments’ pause, he observed, “This is
the second murder that has been committed in this
house.”</p>

<p>“The second!” exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer, suddenly
animated with a feeling of morbid curiosity.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;the second,” repeated Rily. “What! did
you never hear how these three houses came to be
shut up, and why they are supposed to be haunted?”</p>

<p>“Never,” answered the old woman, her manner
convincing the garrulous Mr. John Rily that she
had no objection to be enlightened on the subject.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;as it can’t be more than half-past eleven
o’clock, and we have two hours and a half to pass
away, according to agreement, in this place,” resumed
the Doctor, “I don’t mind telling you the
whole story. Our friend Bob here has heard it
often enough, I dare say: but he will himself admit
that it bears telling over and over again.”</p>

<p>Jack Rily paused for a few moments, and then
commenced the promised narrative, which we shall,
however, put into our own language, the semi-jocular
and flippant style of the Doctor not being quite
suited for so serious a history.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXVII">CHAPTER CLXXVII.<br />

<span class="medium">HISTORY OF THE HAUNTED HOUSES IN
STAMFORD STREET.</span></h2>

<p>Twenty-five years ago there were not three
nicer looking houses in Stamford Street than those
which are now so dilapidated and so wretched in
appearance both outside and internally. The corner
dwelling was inhabited by an old gentleman and his
son. Their name was Mitchell; and a handsomer
youth than Leonard, who at that period had just
completed his twentieth year, was seldom to be met
with. But it was not only on account of his prepossessing
person, elegant manners, and great talents,
that he was a general favourite: it was likewise
in consequence of his admirable behaviour
towards his father. Mr. Mitchell was for many
years a partner in an eminent mercantile firm; but
the sudden death of a beloved wife, who had long
been suffering with a disease of the heart, and who
one evening fell a corpse at her husband’s feet after
having appeared gay and cheerful a few minutes
previously, produced such an effect upon him that
he was thrown on a sick bed, whence he arose at
the expiration of several months&mdash;palsied in all his
limbs! Although he still retained possession of his
intellect, yet his spirit appeared to be completely
broken, and his energies were crushed. An arrangement
was accordingly effected, by virtue of which
he withdrew from the firm on condition of receiving
four hundred pounds a year for the remainder of
his life. These incidents occurred during Leonard’s
seventeenth year; and the affectionate youth immediately
devoted himself to the duty of rendering
his afflicted sire’s existence as pleasing&mdash;or
rather, as little burthensome as possible. His
attentions were unremitting, and yet so delicately
administered that the old man was not suffered
to feel how completely dependent he was,
for solace and comfort, on his only child. When
the weather was fine, Leonard invariably had some
excuse to induce his father to go out for a walk;
and as he supported the arm of that tottering,
feeble, trembling parent, he conversed in a gay and
unrestrained manner, conjuring up those topics
which he knew to be agreeable to the invalid, and
never&mdash;never exhibiting the least impatience at
being thus chained as it were to the side of the
sufferer. Of an evening, the young man would
read aloud those works which best suited his father’s
taste: or he would sit for hours playing at chess&mdash;a
game of which Mr. Mitchell was particularly fond.
When invited to a party, Leonard would at first
promise to attend, so that his father might not perceive
that he remained away entirely on his account:
but the youth was always sure to have a convenient
head-ache or to sprain his ankle, or adopt some
other ingenious and equally venial little device, in
order to have an apology for staying at home. Now
and then his father would see through his motive,
and insist upon him keeping his engagement,&mdash;in
which case Leonard was always sure to leave long
before the breaking-up of the party; and, on his return
home, he would creep noiselessly to his father’s
chamber to assure himself, ere he proceeded to his
own, that the old man was comfortable and wanted
for nothing. In a word, the devotion of this youth
to his afflicted sire was such that all who knew
him beheld him with mingled admiration and respect:
and even the giddiest and most thoughtless
young men of his acquaintance could not bring
themselves to joke or jeer him for that conduct
which, in any other, they would have looked upon
as a steadiness and sedateness carried to an extreme.</p>

<p>Next door to the Mitchells&mdash;that is to say, in
the central of the three houses to which this narrative
relates&mdash;dwelt Mr. Pomfret, who, by the secession
of the paralysed old gentleman, had become
the head of the firm, the business premises of
which were in the City. Mr. Pomfret was likewise
a widower, and likewise possessed an only child.
Ellen Pomfret was a year younger than Leonard;
and she was as beautiful as he was handsome.
They had been acquainted from childhood; and the
affection which in its origin was such as exists
between a brother and a sister, by natural degrees
ripened into a devoted and profoundly-rooted love.
In the estimation of all who know them, there
was a remarkable fitness in the union of this admirable
pair: their style of beauty&mdash;their dispositions&mdash;their
manners&mdash;their acquirements, were of
a nature to adapt them for each other. They were
both tall, slight, and gracefully formed: Ellen’s
hair was of a rich brown, scarcely a shade deeper
than that of Leonard;&mdash;their foreheads were high
and intellectual;&mdash;their eyes were of deep blue&mdash;hers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
more melting and tender than his, which were
animated with the fire of a noble and generous
spirit;&mdash;and never did man nor woman possess finer
teeth than theirs. Both were fond of music and
drawing: both were imbued with deep religious
feelings, sincere and even enthusiastic&mdash;but utterly
devoid of bigotry and uncharitableness;&mdash;and both
loved virtue for its own sake. Faith with them
was a delight and an inspiration encouraging fond
hopes in respect to this world and confidence in the
next,&mdash;a religion that knew naught of ascetic
gloom, but that seemed to trace life’s pathway
amidst love, and perfume, and flowers!</p>

<p>Mrs. Pomfret had died when Ellen was about
fourteen; and for the two following years the
maiden was blessed with the companionship and
counsels of a kind aunt, who, immediately after the
decease of her sister, took up her abode in the
house. But death snatched her away to the tomb
shortly after the sixteenth birth-day of her niece,
who was thus left alone as it were with her father.
Mr. Pomfret, though a kind and well-meaning
man originally, was not a prudent one. He had an
over-weening confidence in his commercial abilities
and financial foresight; and he was thus led into
speculations from which his friends, had he condescended
to consult them, would have dissuaded
him. Many of these speculations he undertook on
his own private account, and independently of the
firm of which, as above described, he became the
head; and his numerous affairs accordingly kept
him much away from home. Ellen was therefore
a great deal alone: for maidenly prudence prevented
her from calling in next door as often as
she could have desired, or as Leonard would have
wished to see her. Still she did now and then pass
an hour or two with Mr. Mitchell and his son, relieving
the latter in his task of reading or his post
at the chess-table. The old gentleman was deeply
attached to Ellen Pomfret; and the more so, inasmuch
as it appeared to be a settled thing that the
two families were to be closely united by means of
the marriage of the young people. But no day was
fixed for this event&mdash;nor indeed did the engagement
appear to be more than a tacit one; for the reader
must remember that at the time when we introduce
the hero and heroine of this narrative, the former
was only twenty years of age, and the latter
nineteen.</p>

<p>The third house to which our present history
especially refers, was inhabited by an old bachelor,
who at the time alluded to was upwards of sixty.
He was a fine man for his age&mdash;boasted that he had
not yet taken to spectacles&mdash;and walked as upright
and as rapidly as if he were twenty years younger.
His rubicund countenance was the very picture of
good-nature: and a very good-natured being he in
reality was. But he was whimsical and eccentric
to a degree; and, though very rich and proud of his
elegantly furnished abode, he seldom invited a
grown-up person to cross his threshold&mdash;much less
to partake of his hospitality. But, on the other
hand, he was devotedly attached to children; and
his greatest delight was to assemble a dozen or so
of his neighbours’ little sons and daughters in his
comfortable parlour or handsome drawing-room,
and make them all as happy as he could. This was
certainly a strange and most unusual predilection
for an old bachelor to entertain;&mdash;but there are exceptions
to all rules&mdash;and Mr. Gamble was a living
proof of the dogma. He was wont to say that it
did his heart good to behold rosy-cheeked, flaxen-haired,
laughing-eyed children romping about him,&mdash;that
it awakened blessed feelings in his soul to
hear their merry shouts and witness their innocent
mirth,&mdash;and that he fancied himself young again
when presiding at the table around which he gathered
them, and where he dispensed fruit, cake,
sweet wine, and comfitures with no niggard hand.
Be it understood, then, that&mdash;at least to our mind&mdash;Mr.
Gamble was a most estimable character: for he
who is fond of children cannot possibly be a bad
man&mdash;whereas we have no confidence whatever in
the individual who does <em>not</em> experience a lively interest
in those endearing, artless little beings. Mr.
Gamble did not consider it to be at all derogatory to
his nature or his age, to join in the infantile sports
which he loved so much to behold; and when the
curtains were drawn and the door closed, he would
even consent to become an active party to a game
of blind-man’s-buff, or allow himself to be converted
for the nonce into a horse for the express
behoof of some chubby urchin more bold in his
requisitions than the rest.</p>

<p>Mr. Gamble was indeed quite a character. He
used frequently to declare that he knew nothing
more silly than to give dinner-parties. “Friendship
is a very queer thing,” he would say, “if it must be
shown by my eating at another’s expense, or by
him coming to me to eat at mine. I would sooner
spend ten pounds upon cakes and oranges for
children who really enjoy them, than ten shillings
on a repast for a grown-up person, who eats in
your presence as if under the influence of a chilling
ceremony.” Relative to adults, therefore, Mr.
Gamble neither gave nor accepted invitations: but
twice or thrice a-week he congregated his little
friends around him&mdash;and the more they romped, the
better he was pleased,&mdash;the more noise they made,
the higher did his spirits rise. If they injured his
furniture, he cared not, provided it was the result
of an accident: but if he once discovered a predilection
to wilful destructiveness, or if he were made
the butt of coarse rudeness instead of the object of
innocent merriment, he never again invited the
offender to his abode.</p>

<p>Considering that the habits of Mr. Gamble were
such as we have taken some little trouble to describe
them, it may easily be supposed that the
neighbours were not a little astonished when it was
rumoured, and ascertained to be a positive fact,
that Mr. Pomfret had veritably and actually been
invited to dine with that eccentric gentleman. This
was alone enough to create an impression that a
revolution had taken place in the opinions of the
old bachelor: but the wonderment was excessive
when it was reported, and likewise discovered to be
true, that Mr. Gamble had dined in his turn with
Mr. Pomfret. At first it was supposed that the
cunning merchant was seeking to ensnare the
wealthy bachelor into a marriage with the beautiful
Ellen: but when it was remembered that she was
engaged to Leonard, and moreover when it was
ascertained that she had passed the evening at the
Mitchell’s on the occasion of the old bachelor dining
with her father, the above-mentioned speculation
was instantly discarded. That a revolution <em>had</em>
taken place in the habits of Mr. Gamble, was however
very certain: for as time wore on, after those
first interchanges of civilities between him and Mr.
Pomfret, their intimacy appeared to increase, and
the parties given by the old bachelor to his juvenile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
friends grew less frequent. At length not a day
passed without an interview occurring between
Gamble and Pomfret: they were often closetted
together for hours in the evening, when the latter
returned home from the City; and the merchant
was moreover frequently seen taking bundles of
papers and correspondence into the other’s house.
It was therefore surmised that they were engaged
together in some speculation: but if this were the
case, it was kept very quiet&mdash;for even Ellen herself
could give her lover Leonard no explanation relative
to the causes of the intimacy that had sprung
up so suddenly between her father and Mr. Gamble.</p>

<p>A conversation which we are about to record,
will however throw some light upon the subject.
It was about six months after the intimacy had
commenced, that Mr. Pomfret returned home from
the City at a later hour than usual, and with a
countenance so pale and careworn, that he appeared
to his affrighted daughter ten years older than when
he quitted her in the morning. Ellen anxiously
implored him to inform her if anything unpleasant
had occurred: but he gave her a sharp reply in the
negative&mdash;as much as to enjoin her to abstain from
questioning him in future. The poor girl turned
aside to conceal the tears that gushed from her
eyes; and Mr. Pomfret, struck by the sudden conviction
that he had behaved most harshly to his
amiable daughter, exclaimed, “Forgive me, Ellen:
but&mdash;to tell you the truth&mdash;I <em>have</em> received disagreeable
intelligence in the City to-day; and it
probably soured my temper for the moment. You
are a good girl,” he added, kissing the tearful
countenance that was now upturned towards his
own; “and I was wrong to speak unkindly to you.
But let that pass: I shall have more command over
myself another time.”&mdash;“Pray do not dwell upon
the subject, my dearest father,” said Ellen. “Will
you have dinner served up at once?”&mdash;“No, my
love,” was the answer: “I do not feel in any humour
for eating. I meant to say,” he added, hastily, but
with some degree of confusion, “I dined in the
City to-day. And now I shall just run in and see
Mr. Gamble for an hour or two; and you can go
and play a game of chess with Mr. Mitchell. I
shall return to supper presently: so mind and be
home again by half-past nine.”&mdash;“You told me the
day before yesterday, dear papa,” said Ellen, “that
the next time I called on Mr. Mitchell, I was to be
sure and ask you for a cheque for the quarter’s income
due to him, and which has been standing over
for nearly a fortnight.”&mdash;“Oh! it does not matter
this evening!” ejaculated Mr. Pomfret, impatiently:
“besides, I have not time to sit down and fill up a
cheque at present,” he added, a sickly expression
passing over his countenance, as if his heart were
smitten painfully within his breast. Then, without
making another observation and in evident haste to
avoid further parlance on the subject, the merchant
threw on his hat and hurried next door. A sigh
escaped from Ellen’s gentle bosom&mdash;for she saw
that there was some profound grief in the depths
of her father’s soul, and, anxious to escape from the
distressing thoughts which such a conviction was
only too well calculated to engender, she made the
greater speed to dress herself for a visit to her
neighbours.</p>

<p>We must for the present follow Mr. Pomfret,
whom we shall overtake in Mr. Gamble’s back-parlour,
which was fitted up as a library, and contained
a small but choice collection of books. The
old bachelor was discussing some cool claret&mdash;for it
was in the midst of a hot summer; and the moment
the merchant made his appearance, he rang for
another glass. Mr. Pomfret sank upon a seat, with
the air of a man who is exhausted in mind and
body; and when the servant had retired, he fixed
his eyes intently on his friend’s countenance, as
he said in a low and solemn tone, “Gamble, I have
dreadful news for you!”&mdash;“For which I am not
altogether unprepared,” returned the old bachelor,
his countenance becoming serious&mdash;if not absolutely
severe.&mdash;“How? what do you mean?” demanded
Pomfret, the gloomy expression of his features
giving way to one of profound astonishment.&mdash;“I
mean,” replied Mr. Gamble, now bending his gaze
with unmistakeable sternness on his companion,
“that for a week past I have had forced upon my
mind the painful conviction that you were deceiving
me.”&mdash;“Deceiving you!” cried Mr. Pomfret,
his cheek blanching, and his tall spare form trembling
either with rage or guilt, it was not easy immediately
to decide which.&mdash;“Yes: deceiving me,
and most grossly deceiving me too!” exclaimed Mr.
Gamble, striking the table violently with his
clenched fist.&mdash;Mr. Pomfret fell back in his chair,
aghast and speechless, like a man from whose
countenance the visor of duplicity has been suddenly
torn.&mdash;“You doubtless desire an explanation,”
resumed Mr. Gamble; “and you shall have
it. Six months have elapsed, sir,” he continued, his
tone becoming reproachful rather than angry,
“since I called at your counting-house in the City
to receive the amount of a draught which had been
forwarded to me from abroad by a gentleman to
whom I advanced a certain sum many years ago,
and which I had given up as lost. The sudden and
most unexpected recovery of that amount somewhat
renewed my confidence in human nature&mdash;a
confidence not altogether destroyed, but long dormant
in my breast. You remember that we began
to converse upon commercial topics; and you finally
stated that if I did not immediately require the
sum I had called to receive, you knew how to lay
it out for me in a safe quarter and at good
interest. I accepted the proposal;&mdash;firstly, because
the funds were so high at the moment that
I did not choose to buy the money in&mdash;secondly,
because we were neighbours, and had known each
other, to speak to at least, for some years&mdash;and
thirdly, because I was in a good humour with mankind
at the moment. You were pleased, on your
side; and when you wrote to me a few days afterwards
to state that the money was invested according
to the terms settled between us, I resolved to
carry my good feeling still farther&mdash;and I asked you
to dinner. Subsequently you returned the compliment;
and I began to think that my long-sustained
misanthropy was founded in error. This belief
opened my heart still farther towards you: and
when I came to know your amiable daughter, I felt
convinced that all men and women were <em>not</em> deceivers.
Such was the state of my mind&mdash;progressing from
a morbid to a healthy condition&mdash;when you proposed
certain speculations to me. I accepted them
to a limited extent, and on particular terms. I advanced
the moneys you required to carry out your
designs; but I adopted the precaution to avoid
anything like a partnership. And this I did <em>only</em>
as a wise precaution&mdash;for I had tutored myself to
place the utmost confidence in you. As time wore
on, you constantly demanded fresh supplies&mdash;and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
did not refuse them, so specious were your representations.
But by degrees I began to entertain
vague suspicions that everything was not as you
would have me view it; and I latterly instituted
inquiries. A week only has elapsed since I acquired
the certainty that the larger portion of the money
advanced by me to you was never laid out in the way
and for the purposes represented by yourself; but
that it has been employed to stop up gaps and supply
deficiencies in your deeply-embarrassed establishment!”&mdash;“My
God! this is but too true!” murmured
the miserable Pomfret. “But you will be
merciful towards a man who is reduced to despair?”&mdash;“I
shall not harm you, sir: neither shall I expose
you,” returned Mr. Gamble, while the merchant’s
countenance somewhat brightened up at this
assurance. “Perhaps, indeed,” added the old
bachelor, after a slight pause, “I may even
save you yet.”&mdash;“Save me!” echoed Pomfret.
“Oh! no: that is impossible! I am so deeply
involved that I owe three times as much as all
you are likely to possess.”&mdash;“I am not so sure of
that, sir,” returned Mr. Gamble, almost in a good-humoured
tone: then, immediately resuming his
former seriousness of voice, he said “It is not so
much the loss of my fourteen thousand pounds that
I deplore: but it is that you have changed my habits,
and I am not so happy as I was. The dealings that I
had with men in my earlier years, made me mistrust
them and taught me to look upon them with unvarying
suspicion. Therefore was it that when I
became rich enough to retire into private life, and
more than rich enough for my purposes, I abjured
the society of those whom the world had spoilt, and
sought the society of those who were too young to
be tainted by that world. I withdrew myself from
the hot atmosphere breathed by men and women,
and joyed in the freshness of the pure air in which
frank, merry, artless, and sportive children dwelt.
My heart, while closing towards one section of the
human race, expanded towards another; and I have
loved the infantine race as dearly&mdash;oh! as dearly
as if I had been the father of a vast family. But
when I renewed my intercourse with adults&mdash;that
is to say, when I was tempted to join your society
and that of the two or three gentlemen and ladies
whom I have occasionally met at your house&mdash;I felt
my love for that infantine race diminishing: or rather,
their presence afforded me less delight and
amusement. It is all this that I deplore; and the
result has been that my home now seems lonely, and
the time hangs heavily upon my hands. Nay, more:
you have been the means of effecting that change in
me which has made me selfish: and I feel capable
even of sacrificing the happiness of another so long
as I can in any way minister unto my own.”&mdash;“I do
not understand you,” said Pomfret, fearful that
these last words implied some vindictive allusion to
himself.&mdash;“I will explain my meaning,” replied Mr.
Gamble. “You tell me that you are so deeply involved
that ruin stares you in the face!”&mdash;“I am so
utterly denuded of resources at this moment,” answered
Pomfret, “that I cannot even pay the quarter’s
income due to my neighbour and late partner,
Mr. Mitchell.”&mdash;“And if you fail, that poor paralytic
old man will be reduced to beggary?” said Gamble.&mdash;Pomfret
covered his face with his hands, and
groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“Nay, more than all this,” continued the old
bachelor, after a long pause, during which he appeared
to be sipping his claret complacently, but
was in reality reflecting profoundly,&mdash;“more than
all this, your partners will be utterly ruined; and
they will curse you as the fatal cause of their dishonour
and their penury. Your daughter, too, will
become a portionless girl; and she will moan the
follies of her father that reduced her from a state
of comparative affluence to a condition of toil for a
poor pittance. Lastly, that fine young man, Leonard
Mitchell, will hate and abhor you as the individual
who has made his father’s last years wretched
and intolerable,and deprived the afflicted septuagenarian
of the very necessaries of life. All these terrible
things, Mr. Pomfret, will be accomplished on the
day when your house stops payment”&mdash;“I know it,
alas! too well!” exclaimed the unhappy, ruined
merchant, clasping his hands together in deep
agony.&mdash;“You are not so old by ten or a dozen
years as I am,” continued Mr. Gamble: “and yet it
does me harm to see you thus reduced to despair.
But let us not waste precious time. What is the
amount that will save you from ruin?”&mdash;“I dare
not name it,” returned Pomfret&mdash;“This is foolish,”
exclaimed the old bachelor, severely: “come, answer
me, or else let our interview terminate at once.
Again I demand of you the amount that can prevent
all the lamentable occurrences which I just now
detailed?”-“Eighty thousand pounds,” was the
reply, delivered almost in a fit of desperation.</p>

<p>Mr. Gamble rose, opened his desk, and taking out
some Bank securities, directed the merchant’s attention
to the sums specified in those documents.
“Ninety-five thousand pounds!” cried Pomfret,
astonished at these evidences of a wealth far greater
than he had supposed the old bachelor to be possessed
of&mdash;“You perceive,” observed Mr. Gamble,
returning the papers to his desk, and resuming his
seat,&mdash;“you perceive that I am the master of means
sufficient to save you from destruction. Indeed, I
can spare the sum necessary, and even then have
four hundred pounds a year left to live upon.”&mdash;“But
is it possible that you can even entertain the
idea of assisting me to such an extent?” cried Mr.
Pomfret, scarcely able to believe his own ears, and
trembling lest he was indulging in a hope that had
no other existence than in a dream.&mdash;“It is quite
possible, sir,” responded the old bachelor, piqued
that his word should be questioned even for a
moment: “and now it all depends upon yourself.”&mdash;“Upon
myself!” repeated Mr. Pomfret, again
surveying his friend with mingled amazement and
incredulity&mdash;“Yes: upon yourself,” cried Mr.
Gamble: “for the amount you require is at your
service, provided you consent to accept me as your
son-in-law!”&mdash;These words were delivered with a
solemn seriousness of tone which forbade the suspicion
that they were uttered jocularly; and so
completely astounded was the merchant that several
minutes elapsed before he could make any reply
During that interval Mr. Gamble still appeared to
sip his claret with calmness: but he was in reality
awaiting with no small degree of anxiety the answer
that would be given to his proposal.</p>

<p>“But do you love my daughter?” inquired Pomfret
at length.&mdash;“I have already told you that I
begin to feel lonely and cheerless,” replied Mr.
Gamble; “and, moreover, I am irresistibly attracted
towards Miss Ellen. I may also say that I should
feel proud and happy to ensure her an independence:
at the same time, I am not endowed with sufficient
philanthropy to induce me to save her father from
ruin, except on the condition of receiving her as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
wife. If my suit be refused, you are ruined; and
will it in that case be prudent to permit her to
espouse that young Mitchell, who will likewise be
reduced to penury? It is clear that if she do not
accept my offer, circumstances will effectually interpose
a barrier between herself and Leonard; and
thus, happen what will, she must renounce all hope
of becoming his bride.”&mdash;“And with the conviction
that she <em>does</em> love Leonard Mitchell, would you
accompany her to the altar?” inquired Mr. Pomfret.&mdash;“Assuredly,”
replied Mr. Gamble. “I have set
my mind upon it, and will risk everything. She is
young, and a first love is seldom more than a blaze
of straw, ardent while it lasts, but speedily exhausted.
When she comes to know me well, and
to reflect that I have saved her father from ruin
and dishonour,&mdash;when, too, she perceives all the delicate
attentions with which I shall surround her,
and the constancy of my endeavour to ensure her
happiness,&mdash;she will yield to the new influences to
which she will be thus subjected; and she will
learn to look upon the old man with respect and
veneration, with gratitude and kindly feelings, if
not with love. The trial may be for the first few
weeks severe; and there may be deep regrets following
upon the disappointment of the vivid hopes
now cherished in her bosom. But, believe me, she
will at length succumb to the conviction that her
happiness has been better consulted by the course
chalked out for her by us, than by that into which
the present state of her affections might impel her.”&mdash;Pomfret
was man of the world enough to know
that all this was mere sophistry; though Gamble
himself believed that he was arguing on the truest
principles: but the merchant was better acquainted
than the old bachelor with the female heart. Nevertheless,
the temptation was irresistible to the man
who hovered upon the verge of ruin: the feelings of
the father were sacrificed to the anxieties of the
merchant, who saw destruction staring him in the
face;&mdash;and, grasping Gamble’s hand, he said in a
deep, impressive tone, “She is yours!”</p>

<p>In the meantime Ellen Pomfret, little suspecting
how her destinies were being disposed of elsewhere,
was passing a couple of hours with Mr. Mitchell
and Leonard. The young man had noticed, the
moment she entered their parlour, that her countenance
was pale; and, with the eagle glance of a
lover, he likewise discovered that she had been
weeping. Burning with impatience to ascertain
the cause of her grief, and not choosing to elicit an
explanation in the presence of his father, for fear
anything might transpire to give the old gentleman
pain, as he was much attached to the young maiden,
whom he looked upon as his intended daughter-in-law,&mdash;Leonard
exclaimed, as soon as she had paid
her respects to his parent, “You are just in time,
Ellen, to help me to tie up a few new plants which
I have purchased:”&mdash;and, taking her hand, he led
her into the little garden at the back of the house.
A very little garden it was, too: but Leonard had
made the most of the circumscribed space; and he
had in reality bought some choice flowers in the
morning. It was not however to them that he now
directed the lovely girl’s attention; but the moment
they stood in the enclosure, he took her hand, saying,
“Ellen, dearest, you are unhappy this evening:
pray tell me what has annoyed you?”&mdash;Miss Pomfret,
who was ingenuousness itself, instantly related
the scene that had taken place between herself and
her father; and the tears again started from her
eyes, as she remembered the harsh&mdash;almost brutal
manner in which he had spoken to her. Leonard
hastened to kiss those diamond drops away from
the damask cheeks adown which they trickled; and
he consoled her by observing that persons in business
were liable to those annoyances that occasionally
soured the temper and rendered them severe
or hasty even to the very beings whom they loved
the most. Leonard’s powers of persuasion were
omnipotent with Ellen; and she speedily sniffled
through her tears. “And now,” continued the
young man, “I will give you a piece of intelligence
that will, I hope, indemnify you, dearest, for the
little vexation you have just experienced. My
father has this day received a letter from an influential
friend, stating that I may rely upon being
nominated to a clerkship in a Government Office in
the course of a month or six weeks.”&mdash;Ellen expressed
her delight at these news; and after the
interchange of a few tender sentiments, the nature
of which our readers can well divine, the youthful
lovers returned to the parlour. There they sate
and conversed with the old gentleman until the
time-piece on the mantel indicated that it was
twenty-five minutes past nine, when Ellen rose and
took her departure, Leonard escorting her to the
door of the adjoining house, where she dwelt.</p>

<p>Her father had returned about ten minutes previously.
The curtains were drawn in the parlour&mdash;the
lamp was lighted&mdash;and the supper was in readiness.
The moment she entered the room, the
beautiful girl cast an anxious look towards her
sire, to gather from his countenance, if possible,
whether his mind had become more composed: but
she was shocked to perceive that his cheeks were
ashy pale, and that a strange, ominous light
gleamed in his restless, anxious eyes. She withdrew
her gaze instantly, fearful lest he might observe
that she noticed his peculiarity of manner
and altered appearance; and, making some casual
remark, she turned to lay aside her bonnet and also
to conceal the tears that again started into her eyes.
For Ellen was of an affectionate disposition, and
loved her father tenderly, and it touched her heart
to the very core to behold the traces of deep, deep
care upon his countenance.</p>

<p>“You have seen Leonard this evening, Ellen?”
said Mr. Pomfret, in a tone so hollow that it startled
her: and she could scarcely compose herself sufficiently
to murmur an affirmative.&mdash;“And do you
love him very, very much?” asked the merchant,
after a long pause.&mdash;“Oh! my dearest father,” she
exclaimed, “you know that I do! Have we not as
it were been brought up together from childhood?”&mdash;“Yes,
yes: it is natural,” said Mr. Pomfret,
bitterly: and he walked to the mantel-piece, turning
his back towards his daughter, to hide the
emotions that swelled his heart almost to bursting.
But Ellen caught sight of his agonising countenance
in the mirror; and, terribly excited, she
sprang towards him and threw her arms around his
neck, crying, “Oh! my dearest parent, some dreadful
grief oppresses you! May I not share it? Can
I not console you? Is there anything that I, poor
weak girl that I am, can do to ease you of this load
of sorrow?”&mdash;“Yes, Ellen,” hastily responded her
father, determined to come at once to an explanation
with his daughter; for suspense and delay
were intolerable. “You can do all, everything
for me: my honour in your hands! ’Tis
for you also to decide whether we shall be reduced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
to penury, or remain in affluence&mdash;whether
that poor palsied old man next door shall continue
to enjoy the comforts of life, or be plunged into
destitution! In a word, Ellen, my very existence
is in your hands; for I will not live to witness all
the terrible afflictions that my accursed folly will have
entailed upon ourselves, as well as upon others!”&mdash;Ellen
was so taken by surprise as these alarming
revelations burst upon her, that she started back in
dismay, and surveyed her sire with a look of such
passionate grief, that he himself grew affrighted in
his turn; and hastily approaching her, he led her to
a seat, saying, “For God’s sake, compose yourself,
Ellen: you have need of all your firmness now!”&mdash;With
a frantic gesture she besought him to keep her
no longer in suspense, but to tell her the worst at
once.&mdash;“I will not torture you, my love,” said the
wretched man, standing like a culprit in her presence.
“Know, then, that I hover on the brink of
ruin. It is not that I think bankruptcy dishonourable:
no&mdash;the most upright men are liable to misfortune
and cannot control adversity. But, were
I to fail, as I am now circumstanced, I could not
save my name from indelible disgrace, nor my partners
and the Mitchells likewise from ruin!”&mdash;Speechless
with horror and amazement, the young
girl gazed fixedly on her father as he spoke.&mdash;“But
there are still means of saving me and the others
also,” he resumed, in a tone so broken that it indicated
how difficult and how painful it was for him
to give utterance to this prelude to an announcement
which he knew must prove terrible indeed.&mdash;“And
those means?” demanded Ellen, recovering
the use of her own voice: for she saw that there
was allusion to herself in her father’s words.&mdash;“Nerve
yourself, my poor girl, to hear something
very shocking to your gentle heart,” said Mr. Pomfret.&mdash;“I
am nerved <em>now</em>,” she replied, her features
assuming the settled aspect of despair. “But the
means?” she repeated, more impatiently.&mdash;“That
you renounce Leonard Mitchell, and accept Mr.
Gamble as your husband,” said the wretched father,
speaking with averted head. A shriek escaped
Ellen’s lips&mdash;and she started wildly from her seat:
then, staggering forward a few paces, she fell into
her parent’s arms&mdash;not insensible, but sobbing convulsively.
She had been prepared for some dreadful
tidings: she was not, however, nerved to meet such
a frightful destiny as that so suddenly offered to her
contemplation;&mdash;and she felt as if she must sink
under the blow. Mr. Pomfret bore her to the sofa;
and, placing himself by her side, said all he could
to console her:&mdash;no&mdash;not all he <em>could</em>&mdash;but all he
<em>dared</em>;&mdash;for he had not courage enough to recall
the words that had sealed her fate!</p>

<p>We must, however, draw a veil over this
afflicting scene. Suffice it to say that the noble-minded
girl eventually came to the determination
to sacrifice herself for the sake of her father&mdash;yes,
and for the sake of the palsied parent of her lover
also! There is a crisis in misery that is in reality
despair, although it may have the outward appearance
of resignation: and this was the condition of
the young lady, when she said to her father, “I will
not prove a disobedient daughter. I therefore consent
to renounce Leonard Mitchell, and to become
the wife of him who demands my hand as the price
of the succour which he is willing to afford you in
this embarrassment.” Mr. Pomfret embraced her
with the most unfeigned ardour, and thanked her
in the most touching terms for her devotedness;
and, strange as it may perhaps appear, Ellen besought
him that the sacrifice should be accomplished
as speedily as possible. This is, however, invariably
the case with a noble heart that resolves upon the
immolation of its best affections: the maiden feared
lest selfish considerations should arise from delay,
to turn her from her purpose;&mdash;and she was anxious
that her self-martyrdom should be performed heroically
and with a good grace. But, oh! in one short hour
how changed was her pure soul: how bitter&mdash;how intense
was now the disappointment that succeeded the
golden dream she had cherished;&mdash;how stern, and
bleak, and cheerless seemed that world on which she
had lately looked as on a fair and sunny landscape,
fragrant with flowers and beautiful with verdure.
Yes&mdash;gloomy indeed is the earth, and worthless is
existence, when viewed through the same mirror
which reflects the heart’s ruined hopes and blighted
affections!</p>

<p>But who was to break the news to Leonard
Mitchell? Ellen was not equal to that task: indeed,
she dared not see him. She felt that if she
were to gaze again upon his handsome countenance&mdash;if
she were to read despair in his eloquent eyes
and listen to the passionate accents of his melodious
though manly voice, appealing to her against
the stern resolve to which circumstances had impelled
her,&mdash;she felt, we say, that she should yield,
and that by so yielding she should fix her parent’s
doom. Mr. Pomfret therefore took upon himself
the mournful task of imparting to the young man
the disappointment that awaited him; and this
was done the morning after the incidents which
we have just described. The merchant threw himself
upon Leonard’s mercy, invoking him by all he
deemed sacred not to seek to see his daughter nor
dissuade her by letter from her holy purpose of
self-devotion. At first the impetuosity of youth
rendered the lover deaf to all reason and to all entreaties:
but by degrees he appeared to receive a
kind of chivalrous inspiration from the heroic example
of her whom he adored; and he awoke to
the necessity of consenting to that dreadful sacrifice,
if only that his sire should not want bread in his
helpless old age. He however begged that Mr.
Mitchell might be kept in the dark relative to all
these occurrences, until Ellen should have become
the wife of Mr. Gamble&mdash;when it would be too
late to recall the sacrifice, and useless to repine
against it. Moreover, Leonard resolved to break
the news so gradiently to his father, that the effect
of the blow occasioned by a son’s deep disappointment
might be as much mitigated as possible; and
to these proposals Mr. Pomfret was only too willing
to assent. And now, as another proof of Leonard’s
devotedness to his afflicted sire, must be mentioned
the fact that, though bearing in his bosom
a heart wrung almost to breaking, he still maintained
a calm exterior; and during the week which
elapsed ere Ellen became the wife of Mr. Gamble,
Mr. Mitchell beheld nothing strange nor suspicious
in his son’s manner.</p>

<p>And at the expiration of that week, the sacrifice
was consummated. The marriage was solemnised
by special license, and with great privacy; and it
was not known in Stamford-street until a late
hour on the wedding-day that such an extraordinary
alliance had taken place. By that time the victim-bride
was far away from London&mdash;seated by the
side of her old husband in the post-chaise that was
bearing them to some country-place where they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
were to pass the honeymoon. Mr. Pomfret had
received the price stipulated for his daughter; and
his honour&mdash;his commercial honour, we mean&mdash;was
saved! Alas! how many marriages of this unnatural
kind are constantly taking place in this civilised&mdash;this
enlightened&mdash;this Bible-reading&mdash;this
moral country!&mdash;how many fair young maidens are
purchased by old men’s gold, the performance of
the religious ceremony only adding a hideous
mockery to a flagrant injustice! And yet how
shocked are those mercenary fathers and match-making
mothers who thus sacrifice their daughters’
pure affections to the most selfish interests&mdash;how
shocked, we say, are they when they read that there
are countries in the world where men buy their
wives outright! Oh! ye Exeter Hall Saints, who
send forth missionaries to christianise the heathen
amongst whom such barter or purchase prevails,
have ye nothing to reform at home? Is the Mussulman
who buys his Circassian or his Georgian
wife in a slave-market more reprehensible than the
tottering old lord or the nabob with his liver eaten
away, who purchases an English, a Scotch, or an
Irish beauty in the market of West End Fashion?
Go, ye Exeter Hall Saints, into that sphere where
all is glitter outside and hollowness of heart within,
and count the many titled or wealthy septuagenaries
to whose corpse-like side fresh and blooming girls
of nineteen and twenty are bound by marriage-ties!
Are such alliances founded upon those holy affections
which God has implanted in the human
breast?&mdash;or are they proofs of the rebellion
which selfish interests consummate against nature’s
laws and heaven’s own divine promptings?
But if we direct our attention to that sphere wherein
the industrious millions struggle with starvation,
oppression, and wrong, do we find such instances of
outrage against all that is natural, moral, and just?
Do we discover the agricultural labourer or the
mechanic of seventy with a wife of nineteen? Out
of a hundred marriages in humble life, there is not
more than one such case. And yet the aristocratic,
the wealthy, and the great are ever declaiming upon
the immorality of the poor! Immorality indeed!
’Tis you, ye aristocrats, who are in reality demoralised:
’tis you, ye oppressors, who would stand a
far better chance of winning a place in heaven, were
ye to imitate the humble virtues of the oppressed!
Oh! the soul sickens at the idea that a lazy, insolent,
intolerant oligarchy should be permitted to
heap so much abuse upon the toiling, starving,
deeply-wronged millions!</p>

<p>But to return to the thread of our narrative. It
was in the evening of the day on which Ellen became
the wife of Mr. Gamble, that Mr. Mitchell was
seated at the open window of his front parlour, a
wire-blind enabling him to note all that passed in
the street, but preventing persons outside from
seeing into the room. Leonard was sitting near
him, and racking his brain for the best means to
commence a conversation to which he might give
such a turn as to enable him to break the news of
the day to his father. But every time the young
man prepared to speak, his heart’s emotions rose as
if to suffocate him; and at last he was obliged to
hurry from the parlour and seek his own chamber
in order to give free vent to feelings that could no
longer be restrained. Scarcely had he left the
room, when two gentlemen&mdash;dwellers in Stamford
Street&mdash;encountered each other precisely opposite
the Mitchells’ window; and after the usual greetings,
one said: “I am just going to call upon our
mutual friend Mr. Pomfret, to congratulate him.”&mdash;“Congratulate
him!” exclaimed the other: “upon
what event?”&mdash;“On the marriage of his daughter
with the wealthy Mr. Gamble,” was the reply.
“What! you have not heard of it? Oh! It is quite
true, I can assure you. The ceremony took place
this morning: I have the fact from the clergyman’s
own lips.”&mdash;“But I thought that Miss Pomfret was
engaged to Leonard Mitchell?” observed the other
gentleman, evidently much amazed by the intelligence
he had just received.&mdash;“Hush!” said the first
speaker, glancing significantly towards the open
window; and, taking his friend’s arm, he drew him
a few paces farther on. But had they stayed to
enter into further explanations, it would have been
all the same: the conviction that his unhappy son
had sustained a most frightful blow to his happiness,
burst upon the mind of the wretched father
like a tornado on a traveller in the desert; and
when Leonard returned to the room, he found the
old man a corpse in his chair!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXVIII">CHAPTER CLXXVIII.<br />

<span class="medium">CONCLUSION OF THE HISTORY OF THE HAUNTED
HOUSES.</span></h2>

<p>Three years had elapsed since the occurrences
just related; and it was on a fine summer afternoon
that a tall, handsome young soldier, in the
graceful undress of a private in a dragoon regiment,
was walking down Regent Street. His countenance
was somewhat sunburnt; but there was about him
such an air of gentility that, even had he been far
less good-looking than he really was, it would have
been impossible to pass him by with indifference.
His figure was slight, but admirably formed and
well knit: his legs were straight as a dart; and he
carried his arms with that gentle rounding which
is so compatible with military grace. His whiskers
were small, but curling and glossy; and the slight
moustache that he wore was quite sufficient to turn
the head of any giddy girl&mdash;the more so that, as his
lips were always kept the least thing apart, that
fringe set off his fine teeth to greater advantage.
His rich brown hair, worn short according to the
regulation, stood out in small but natural curls
from beneath his undress cap; and the somewhat
darkly pencilled brows arched above eyes of deep
blue, and in which there was a melancholy expression
that did not however deteriorate from the
masculine beauty of his person. His uniform was
scrupulously neat: his boots well polished; his
buckskin gloves white as snow;&mdash;and did he remove
those gloves, his hands appeared to be almost
as delicate in complexion as a lady’s. In a word
he was the very <em>beau ideal</em> of a soldier; and nature’s
stamp of aristocracy was upon him:&mdash;yet
was he only a private&mdash;a humble private in his
regiment!</p>

<p>We said that the day was remarkably fine; and
it was at that hour when the fashionable world
goes forth to while away the time until dinner.
Regent Street was thronged with gay equipages
filled with elegantly dressed ladies, and attended
by domestics in gaudy liveries; and the footways
were likewise crowded, but with a mere miscellaneous
company. For when the daughters of
fashion appear abroad in the afternoon, the daughters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
of crime likewise come forth; and yet we doubt
whether the immorality that walks the pavement
is so much greater than that which rides in carriages
as the world generally supposes. Behold that
magnificent equipage wherein the elderly dowager
and the beauteous young girl of seventeen or eighteen
are seated: it stops at the door of a fashionable
linen-draper’s, and the dowager leans heavily on
the arm of the tall, handsome footman who hands
her out, while the young lady throws a rapid but
significant glance at the slim, graceful page who
has likewise dismounted from behind the vehicle.
Or again, behold that gentleman on horseback,
moving leisurely along, and gazing intently at each
carriage which approaches down the wide avenue:
at length he recognises the equipage which he is so
anxiously expecting&mdash;and, riding up, he exchanges
a few words with the fair creature who is its sole
occupant. A day, an hour, and a place are named
for an appointment of even a far less innocent nature
than this one; and the lover passes on with triumph
in his heart, while the carriage whirls away the titled
lady who has already assented to a step that must
lead to the dishonour of her husband. Again, behold
the splendid chariot, with a coronet on the
panel, and in which three beauteous girls with their
maternal parent&mdash;herself a fine woman&mdash;are seated.
Would you believe that care was harboured in hearts
where smiles appear on radiant countenances? And
yet, the eldest of those sisters is a prey to a mortal
apprehension: she has been frail&mdash;weak&mdash;the victim
of her own strong desires and the opportunity afforded
by some handsome, but obscure and ineligible
lover; and now she dreads lest a few months should
betray her unchastity and ruin her for ever. But
we have not leisure to extend this picture:&mdash;we
must return to the handsome dragoon who is walking,
in a leisurely but somewhat thoughtful manner,
down Regent Street.</p>

<div id="i_289" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_289.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And wherefore was he thus partially pensive?
Because nearly three years had elapsed since he
had last seen London, and his return to the capital
revived a thousand reflections which were indeed
sufficient to touch his heart painfully. He thought
of his early youth&mdash;the hopes which he had cherished
when the future was bright before him&mdash;the crushing
disappointments and accumulated miseries that
had suddenly fallen upon his head&mdash;and his present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
position, so different from what it ought to be.
Yes&mdash;and he thought, too, of <em>one</em> whom he had
loved so fondly&mdash;oh! so fondly, that his passion was
a worship&mdash;an idolatry, and whose image was indelibly
impressed upon his soul. Time had taught
him the necessity of resignation to a lot which he
could not alter&mdash;a fate which he could not change&mdash;a
destiny which he could not subdue: and though
that same resignation, aided by the faith of a sincere
Christian and a firm reliance on Him who disposeth
of all things, had deprived his anguish of its sting
and blunted the iron that had entered into his soul&mdash;there
were, nevertheless, moments when the cloud
came over the handsome countenance, and the soldier’s
heart swelled almost to bursting. And this
was now the state of his mind as he passed along the
fashionable quarter of that metropolis where he had
arrived with his regiment only the evening before.
He had no particular aim in view&mdash;he was not on
his way to see any friends: the only being on the
face of the earth in whom he felt interested, was
she whom he had once loved so devotedly&mdash;whom
he still loved with the mellowed and almost embittered
affection of disappointment&mdash;and whom he
dared not inquire after, much less venture to visit.
His return to the capital had unsettled him: he felt
no inclination to remain in the barracks and pursue
his favourite recreation of reading&mdash;and he had
therefore walked abroad in the hope of diverting
his mind from the unpleasant thoughts that intruded
upon it.</p>

<p>The handsome dragoon had just entered the
arcade of the Quadrant, when he was suddenly
struck as if by paralysis&mdash;or as it were with a violent
blow dealt by an invisible hand: he stopped
short&mdash;then staggered back a few paces&mdash;and leant
against one of the pillars for support,&mdash;his countenance
the while denoting the most intense emotions.
For, issuing from a shop, were two persons
both of whom he instantaneously recognised, but
on one of whom his eyes became rivetted as if by
enchantment. Yes:&mdash;there was Ellen&mdash;the Ellen
whom he had loved&mdash;whom he still loved&mdash;leaning
on the arm of her old husband&mdash;that man who
had robbed <em>him</em>&mdash;Leonard Mitchell&mdash;of the object
of such a fervent and undying affection! But
neither the lady herself nor Mr. Gamble observed
the young soldier: for, on issuing from the shop,
they passed down the Quadrant; and thus their
backs were almost immediately turned upon him.
Recovering his presence of mind, and passing his
hand hastily across his brow, as if to tear away a
mist that hung upon his eyes, Leonard Mitchell&mdash;for
he indeed was the handsome young dragoon&mdash;was
already pushing his way amidst the crowd and
hurrying after Ellen, when the thought flashed, like
blasting lightning, to his soul, that she was an elegantly
dressed lady, leaning on the arm of a husband
who was evidently a gentleman of substance&mdash;and
<em>he</em> was a common soldier! Oh! never&mdash;never
were the accursed class-distinctions of an artificial
state of society felt so bitterly as on the present
occasion. Not that Leonard mistrusted Ellen’s
heart&mdash;not that he feared of experiencing a cold
reception from one of her generous nature: but a
sense of propriety&mdash;a deep conviction of what was
due, under circumstances, to herself and her husband,
caused him suddenly to stop short;&mdash;then, in
obedience to the new impulse which was received
from this revulsion of his feelings, he turned
abruptly from the Quadrant into one of those
streets that stretch towards the district of Golden
Square.</p>

<p>Walking on, like one intoxicated, and with eyes
that saw nothing&mdash;as if all the powers of vision,
physical and mental, were absorbed in the necessity
of internal contemplation&mdash;the young man felt as if
he were going mad. There was a fearful hurry in
his brain; and yet, palpable and distinct, as it were,
in his heart was the image that for years had been
there, but each feature&mdash;each lineament of which
had suddenly received the most vivid colourings of
revival. She was beautiful as ever&mdash;more beautiful,
if possible, in the glory of her womanhood; and,
although her countenance was somewhat pale and
had a melancholy&mdash;yes, a very melancholy expression&mdash;this
only added to her charms, in his estimation,
by rendering her the more interesting. By
degrees, his thoughts grew more settled&mdash;the whirlwind
that raged in his brain, abated in violence;
and suddenly there sprang up in his soul a feeling
of pleasure at the idea that her features wore that
shade of mournfulness. For, oh! there could be no
doubt as to the cause: she was unhappy&mdash;unhappy
on account of him! She had not, then, forgotten
him&mdash;she remembered their youthful loves: perhaps
he was still dear to her? That thought became
more delightful, as it seemed more consistent with
probability; and now <em>he</em> was not altogether so thoroughly
devoid of hope&mdash;so profoundly a prey to
black despair, as he had been a few minutes previously.
Hope, indeed! what could he hope? He
knew not&mdash;he did not immediately pause to ask
himself the question: but he abandoned himself to
the delicious reverie into which the altered current
of his thoughts thus madly hurried him. When he
awoke, as it were, from this day-dream, he was
astonished to find that it had lasted so long, and
without interruption: for, while wrapped up in
that vision, he had threaded many streets&mdash;accomplished
a considerable distance&mdash;and was now close
to the toll-gate of Waterloo Bridge. Entering upon
that mighty viaduct, he seated himself in one of the
recesses, and again gave way to the meditations
which the incident of the afternoon had conjured
up.</p>

<p>But how was it that Leonard Mitchell had taken
the direction of Waterloo Bridge, in that species of
somnambulism under which he had been labouring?
Because it was the way to Stamford Street; and,
in his walking reverie, an irresistible impulse had
influenced his footsteps, even while he appeared to be
proceeding at random. And what now was the
nature of his reflections? He experienced an ardent
longing to cross the bridge&mdash;to enter Stamford
Street&mdash;and to behold once more the house where
all his early years were passed: yes&mdash;and to behold
also the dwelling of her whom he loved! But did
he know that Mr. and Mrs. Gamble still resided in
Stamford Street? He was completely ignorant on
the subject; and an ardent curiosity impelled him
to clear up the point in question. Still he hesitated:
amidst all the feelings by which he was now
animated, and the longings by which he was
prompted, a sense of duty rose up in his mind,&mdash;of
duty towards her whom he loved,&mdash;towards her
husband&mdash;and towards himself. Why should he
incur the risk of meeting her, and perhaps unsettling
her studied attempts at unmixed devotion to him
whose name she bore?&mdash;why should he do aught
that might arouse the suspicion or excite the
jealousy of the old man who doubtless treasured his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
young wife as a peerless jewel?&mdash;and why should
he resuscitate all his own griefs and sorrows, by
an encounter with one who was lost to him perhaps
for ever? These questions did he ask himself
over and over again: they were the basis of the
reasoning which he held with his own heart&mdash;his
own soul&mdash;in order to crush the promptings that
urged him towards the scene of past and happier
days. Alas! with all his natural rectitude of principle&mdash;with
all his generosity of disposition&mdash;with
all his honourable feelings, Leonard Mitchell was
but a poor weak mortal, like the rest of us;&mdash;and
while still arguing with himself, he was traversing
the bridge&mdash;he was directing his way towards Stamford
Street!</p>

<p>As he drew nearer to the end of the long thoroughfare&mdash;that
end which joins the Blackfriars
Road&mdash;he relaxed his speed; and though his pace
was slower, his heart beat more rapidly. At length
he came within sight of the three corner houses:
he paused&mdash;he stopped&mdash;heaven alone knows how
acute were the emotions that agitated within him
then! Again he moved onward&mdash;he called all his
courage, all his presence of mind to his aid;&mdash;and
now he passed by Mr. Gamble’s house. Irresistibly
he glanced towards the window: his eyes met those
of Ellen;&mdash;and he heard the faint scream of astonishment
that burst from her lips! But the beauteous
countenance had disappeared: had she, then,
fainted? No&mdash;her feelings had doubtless overcome
her for a few moments;&mdash;but she speedily recovered&mdash;she
reappeared at the window&mdash;and a rapid sign
conveyed to him the intimation that she would come
forth and join him presently. All this passed so
quickly as to be unobserved by any of the neighbours;
although it is probable that had ten thousand
pairs of eyes been rivetted on the house, Ellen
would have not acted differently&mdash;for she saw no
one save him of whom she had heard nothing for
three long years. Leonard, half intoxicated with
joy at the signal that had been made by her fair
hand, and aided in its interpretation by the expression
of her countenance,&mdash;scarcely believing, however,
that such happiness could indeed await him&mdash;and
not pausing for a single instant to ask himself
whether he were acting well or even prudently&mdash;Leonard,
we say, passed on. The central of the
three houses was still occupied by Mr. Pomfret; for
his name was on the brass-plate on the front-door:&mdash;but
the corner house&mdash;the house where Leonard had
dwelt so many years, and where his revered father
had died in so sudden and awful a manner&mdash;was
shut up, a board intimating that it was to let. The
young soldier had not, however, many minutes’
leisure to reflect upon the scenes of past days; for,
aware that Ellen could not prudently join him
within a few yards of her own door, he crossed the
Blackfriars Road, and loitered at the corner of Holland
Street. In a short time he beheld her approaching:
she saw him&mdash;she followed the direction
which he took;&mdash;and he proceeded farther down the
comparatively secluded place which he had deemed
most fitting for this interview. At length he halted;
and in another minute his heart’s idol was by his
side. She had purposely put on a cottage-bonnet
and a plain shawl;&mdash;and thus the few people who
passed saw nothing very remarkable in a modestly
dressed female in company with a private dragoon.</p>

<p>But even if they had attracted disagreeable notice,
what was it to them who had now no thought&mdash;no
eyes&mdash;no ears save for each other? Without a word
at first&mdash;but after a brief though earnest pressure
of the hand&mdash;Leonard gave the young lady his arm;
and they passed along Holland Street. A few low,
but anxious inquiries were rapidly interchanged,
and as speedily answered;&mdash;but frequent, long, and
tender were the looks they fixed upon each other.
A few minutes’ walk brought them to Southwark
Bridge, to which they ascended; and when seated
in one of the recesses of that almost entirely deserted
viaduct, the restraint under which they had
hitherto laboured was immediately thrown aside.</p>

<p>“At length we meet again, Ellen,” said Leonard,
taking her hand and retaining it in his own, while he
gazed fondly upon her.&mdash;“Yes,” she replied, murmuringly,
and holding down her blushing countenance:
“but do you think the worse of me, because,
yielding to a sudden and irresistible impulse, and
availing myself of my husband’s temporary absence,
I thus stole forth to meet you&mdash;to hear from your
own lips that you are happy?”&mdash;“Happy!” repeated
Leonard, bitterly: then, unwilling to cause her additional
pain, for his ejaculation had already brought
the diamond-tears to her violet eyes, he said, “How
can I think the worse of you, Ellen, when you
come forth as a sister to pass a few minutes with a
brother who can not, dares not visit you at your own
abode? But rather let me ask, whether <em>you</em>, Ellen,
are happy?”&mdash;The young lady endeavoured to give
utterance to a reply: but, overpowered by her emotions,
she burst into an agony of weeping. Unable
to restrain his own feelings any longer, Leonard
caught her in his arms, strained her to his breast
and imprinted a thousand kisses upon her moist
lips and her tear-bedewed cheeks: for no eye, save
that of God, beheld them at this moment. Several
minutes passed ere either could recover the faculty
of speech; and then they spoke so low&mdash;so feelingly&mdash;and
in such accents of deep, deep sorrow, that it
was easy for each to perceive that the love of the
other had not become impaired by time, separation,
or circumstances.&mdash;“You were wrong, oh! you were
very wrong, Leonard,” said Ellen, “to abandon your
home and your friends, the moment after your father’s
funeral. It is true that you did not leave us
altogether in uncertainty and suspense relative to
your fate&mdash;that you left for me a note acquainting
me with your determination to enlist and earn your
bread honourably! But, oh! wherefore have adopted
that distressing alternative?”&mdash;“Can you not understand
my feelings, Ellen?” asked the young
man, almost reproachfully. “My father’s death
left me without interest to obtain the situation
that had been promised to me through him; and
his income likewise perished with him. I had
no claim upon Mr. Pomfret: neither would I
have accepted eleemosynary assistance. What could
I do? I disposed of the furniture to pay off the
few debts owing by my father and the expenses of
the funeral; and I made all my arrangements with
as much haste as possible, in order to be able to
leave that once happy neighbourhood before you
and&mdash;and&mdash;your husband should return to it. I
then repaired to Hounslow, and enlisted. Yesterday
my regiment was ordered to London; and
within a few hours of my arrival, I experience the
happiness&mdash;the indescribable happiness of thus encountering
you. And now, Ellen, let us think&mdash;or,
at all events, let us talk no more of the past.
I cannot bear to look back upon it. But, my God!”
he exclaimed passionately, and suddenly interrupting
himself: “wherefore should I dread to retrospect,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
since the happiness of the present is only
transitory, and there is no hope for the future?”&mdash;Thus
speaking, the young man covered his face with
his hands and moaned audibly.</p>

<p>“Oh! this is dreadful!” exclaimed Ellen, with
accents of despair. “Leonard! I implore you not
to give way to affliction thus. Listen to me, my beloved
one&mdash;for you are as dearly and as fondly loved
as ever; and I hesitate not to give you that assurance.”&mdash;“Oh!
is it possible? can I believe my
ears?” cried the young dragoon, now turning upon
the lady a countenance suddenly lighting up with
the animation of indescribable joy and bliss, as the
rays of the setting sun played upon those handsome
features. “But you forget,” he said, after a brief
pause, and with a cloud again appearing upon his
face, “that you are the wife of another?”&mdash;“Then
it is you who love me not!” exclaimed Ellen, in a
tone of disappointment and reproach.&mdash;“Not love
you!” repeated Leonard: “Oh! how cruel of you
thus to speak!”&mdash;and again snatching her to his
bosom, he covered her lips and cheeks with kisses&mdash;kisses
which she as fondly and as passionately returned.
“Yes: Ellen, you know that I love and
adore you!” he added in a voice of the tenderest
sincerity.&mdash;“And I am not ashamed, Leonard, to
give you a reciprocal assurance,” said the young
wife of another. “Oh! wherefore should I attempt
to restrain my natural feelings? Believe me that I
am much changed since last we met: I no longer
see things in the same light. For, to speak candidly,
I have a deep conviction of the disgrace of
having been sold and bought for that dross which
men so much prize. I cannot help the thoughts
that steal upon me; and therefore it is that I have
long ceased to look upon my father with respect. I
feel that he sacrificed me&mdash;me, his only daughter,
whom he might have made so happy! I feel also
that he who is my husband hesitated not to immolate
the hopes of my youth to his own selfishness.
These are sad&mdash;nay, terrible thoughts, Leonard:
but I again assure you that I cannot combat against
them. It is true that my father is now rich and
prosperous, and that he sometimes thanks me as the
authoress of his fortunes: true also is it that my
husband treats me with the utmost kindness. But
never&mdash;never ought I to have been placed in the
position to receive such thanks from the one, nor
such kindness from the other: for, between them,
they have wrecked my happiness, blighted my hopes,
ruined all my youthful dreams of felicity. There
are times, then, when I feel as if it would be a relief
to fly from the neighbourhood of a father whom I
am almost compelled to look upon as an enemy,
and from the arms of a husband who is loathsome
to me!”&mdash;As she uttered these last words, in a low
tone but with a bitter emphasis, Ellen bent her
countenance&mdash;her burning countenance&mdash;over her
lover’s hand, which she pressed to her lips.&mdash;“Then
you would fly with me even now, dearest,” he said,
in a voice rendered tremulous by indescribable
emotions, “did circumstances permit me to accompany
you?”&mdash;Ellen made no verbal answer; but
the rapturous manner in which she again pressed
his hand to her rich, red mouth was a sufficiently
significant response&mdash;“Alas! that may not be,”
resumed Leonard mournfully; and now the young
lady absolutely shuddered in his arms, as if an ice-chill
had suddenly fallen upon a heart an instant
before so warm with passion. “No&mdash;that may not
be,” continued Leonard, determined not to leave her
in the least degree of suspense. “Behold this uniform&mdash;a
uniform which is accursed under all circumstances,
not only on account of the soul-crushing,
merciless discipline and degrading servitude of
which it is the badge, but also because it constitutes
the barrier to the wishes which you so generously
intimated and which I so enthusiastically
share.”&mdash;“But your discharge can be purchased,
can it not?” asked Ellen, bending down her head
to conceal her deep blushes.&mdash;“When I enlisted,
Ellen,” solemnly and mournfully replied Leonard,
“I swore within myself an oath&mdash;an oath ratified
by all I deem sacred in heaven and by all my hopes
of an hereafter&mdash;to follow the course of this new
destiny which I carved out for myself, and, if possible,
to rise to distinction in this service which I
dare not quit. I was young when I made that
vow; and the hope which dictated it never will be
fulfilled;&mdash;for the English soldier is a serf&mdash;a slave;
and the idea of rising&mdash;ha! ha!”&mdash;and Leonard
laughed wildly. “At all events,” he added hastily,
and again assuming a solemn tone, “I respect the
oath that I took; and you, who love me, will not
counsel me to break it. But we can see each other
often, Ellen&mdash;we can meet, as we have met to-night&mdash;&mdash;.”&mdash;“Then
with that assurance must I
content myself, Leonard!” interrupted the impassioned
young lady, in whom, as the reader may have
surmised, the hand of affliction, the tyranny of a
parent, and the selfishness of the old man who
bought her with his gold, had deadened those delicate
feelings and even undermined the virtuous
principles which had characterised her in her days
of happy innocence.&mdash;“Yes,” returned Leonard,
“with that understanding must we endeavour to
console ourselves! And now, my beloved one, it
is time for me to leave you: remember,” he added
bitterly, “that though a man in years, I belong to
a service where I am treated as a child and limited
to particular hours.”&mdash;“Would to God that you
were emancipated from this dreadful thraldom!”
exclaimed Ellen, weeping.&mdash;“Nay, I was wrong to
say aught to afflict you,” returned Leonard, embracing
her tenderly. A few minutes more did they
pass together, exchanging the most passionate
caresses and earnest protestations of unalterable
affection; and when they separated at last, it was
not without having arranged for another meeting
at an early day.</p>

<p>It would be scarcely possible to describe the
feelings which animated the young lovers as they
respectively hastened to their abodes&mdash;the one to
his barracks, the other to her home. As we have
before stated, circumstances had so warped Ellen’s
mind, that she paused not even to reflect for an
instant upon the dangerous course on which she
had entered: she had no longer any ties to bind her
with filial love to her father&mdash;and she never had
any bond of affection to link her to her husband.
Therefore all she now thought of, or cared to think
of, was that she had recovered a lover whom she
adored; and she would have ridiculed and laughed
at the idea of disgrace and of a ruined reputation,
had any friend counselled her in the matter. On
his side, Leonard was less hardened&mdash;for such indeed
is the term which might be applied to Ellen’s
state of mind&mdash;to the consequences of this new
phase of his existence. He shuddered at the thought
of inducing a young wife to conduct herself in a
manner so injurious to her husband’s happiness;
and he resolved, in his calmer moments, that when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
he met Ellen again, according to the appointment
already arranged, he would represent to her the necessity
of their eternal separation. But when they
did meet, and in a secluded place, she appeared so
ravishingly beautiful, and spoke with so much
tenderness, and seemed so completely happy in his
society, and was withal so unfeignedly loving, that
he could not bring himself to give utterance to the
words that trembled upon his tongue&mdash;words that
would have chased away those charming smiles,
dimmed with tears the lustre of those melting eyes,
hushed with sighs that language of fervid passion,
and changed to dark despair all that bright and
glowing bliss. Therefore they separated a second
time with an arrangement to meet again:&mdash;and on
the occasion of the third interview Leonard found
himself less disposed than before to make a representation
which would be fatal to the happiness of
both. To be brief, interview succeeded interview,
Leonard resolving that each one should be the
last,&mdash;until at length love’s dalliance became irresistible
in its consequences; and, opportunity serving
in all respects, the lovers were criminal! From
that day forth Leonard thought no more of the
impropriety of their meetings, which thereafter
grew more frequent and longer in duration.</p>

<p>We shall here interrupt the thread of our narrative
for a brief space, in order to make a few observations
upon the condition of the private soldier.
And, in the first instance, let us record our conviction
that there is not a more generous-hearted, a
nobler-minded, or a more humane set of men breathing
than those who constitute the ranks of the
British Army; while there is not a more tyrannical,
overbearing, illiberal, and self-sufficient class than
that composed of the officers of this army. But
how is the latter fact to be accounted for? Because
the Army is the mere plaything of the Aristocracy&mdash;a
means of providing for the younger sons of noblemen,
and enabling titled mammas to show off their
striplings in red coats. What opinion can we have
of the constitution of the army, so far as the officers
are concerned, when we find Prince Albert suddenly
created a Field-Marshal!<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Such a spectacle is nauseating
in the extreme; and the German must have
execrably bad taste, or else be endowed with inordinate
conceit, to hold the <em>baton</em> of a Marshal
when he has not even the military knowledge of a
drummer-boy. Since the Army is thus made a mere
tool in the hands of a rascally Aristocracy, what
sympathy can possibly exist between the officers
and the men? The former look upon the latter as
the scum of the earth&mdash;mere slaves on a level with
shoe-blacks; and hence the barbarous cry of “Flog!
flog! flog!” But there is no love lost between the
classes: for the soldiers hate and abhor their officers,
whom they naturally and most justly look upon as
their tyrants and oppressors. It is enough to make
the blood boil with indignation to think that those
fine, stalwart, gallant fellows should be kicked
about at the caprice of a wretched ensign or contemptible
cornet just loosened from his mamma’s
apron-strings,&mdash;or bullied by older officers whose
only “excellence” is their relationship to nobility,
and their power to obtain promotion <em>by purchase</em>.
The generality of the officers in the British Army
are nothing more nor less than a set of purse-proud
bloodhounds, whose greatest delight is to behold
the blood streaming down the backs of those men
who alone win their country’s battles. When the
Duke of York (who was a humane man, though as
great a scamp as ever had a <span class="smcap">COLUMN OF INFAMY</span>
erected to his memory) limited corporal punishment
to 300 lashes, the full amount was invariably inflicted
in nineteen out of twenty cases: but even
this would not satisfy the bloodhounds, who annoyed
and pestered the Duke on the subject to such
an extent that he was literally bullied into empowering
them to hold General Regimental Courts-Martial,
by whose decision 500 lashes might be
administered to the unhappy victim. For years and
years was the torture of military flogging in England
a shame and a scandal to all Europe; and it
was absolutely necessary that a fine fellow should
be <em>murdered</em> at Hounslow by the accursed lash,
before the barbarous Government would interfere.
All the world knows that a <span class="smcap">BRITISH SOLDIER</span> <em>was
murdered</em> in this revolting manner, and in the presence
of his horror-stricken comrades: for be it remembered
that when these appalling spectacles take
place, the eyes that weep and the hearts that grow
faint are those of the soldiers&mdash;never of the officers!</p>

<p>Again we ask, then, what sympathy can possibly
exist between the privates and those in command?
None: the soldiers would be more grovelling than
spaniels if they could possibly kiss the hands that
cuff them, or lick the shoes of those who kick
and spurn them. The British soldier has his feelings
as well as others&mdash;aye, and his spirit too; and
he feels the iron of a cruel discipline and a heartless
system rankling in his very soul. The celebrated
John Wilkes was wont to say, “The very worst use
you can put a man to, is to hang him.” We agree
with the <em>dictum</em>: but we aver in addition that it is
an equally vile use to flog him. In fact, the whole
treatment of the soldier, from the day of his enlistment
until that of his discharge, is one continuous
system of tyranny. Deception is made use of to
ensnare him into the service&mdash;a crushing despotism
is maintained to render him a docile, pliant tool
while he is in it&mdash;and the basest ingratitude marks
his departure from it, when he is turned adrift on
the world without a penny to help him. The infamy
commences with the recruiting sergeant&mdash;is perpetuated
by all the officers&mdash;and is consummated by
the Government. Take the case of Leonard Mitchell,
in respect to enlistment. The young man was assured
by the recruiting sergeant that his pay would
be a guinea a-week: it however turned out to be
only 9<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>, from which 5<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em> were stopped for
messing and washing, 2<em>s.</em> 7&frac12;<em>d.</em> for clothes, and 3&frac12;<em>d.</em>
for articles to clean his uniform with&mdash;leaving 7<em>d.</em>
per week, or <em>one penny a-day</em>, for pocket-money!
And this is the condition of a British dragoon&mdash;with
less pocket-money than a school-boy receives
from his parents!</p>

<p>The Government relies upon the fidelity of the
Army from the fact that it is officered by the scions
of the aristocracy, who are of course interested in
upholding all kinds of abuses. Hence the belief
which the Government entertains that in case of a
popular convulsion the troops would be certain to
fire upon the people. But, in spite of the lordlings
and aristocratic offshoots who command the army,
we firmly believe that it all depends upon the cause
in which such popular convulsion might arise,
whether the troops would really massacre their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
civilian-brethren. If it were a glorious and just
struggle for rights pertinaciously withheld and privileges
doggedly refused, the Army would <em>not</em> act
against the people. Even the Government itself
has fears on this head, ignorant though it be of the
real state of feeling anywhere save in the circles of
the oligarchy;&mdash;for on a recent occasion<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> when
tremendous military preparations were made to resist
an expected outbreak of the working-men of
London, the Government set policemen in plain
clothes to act as spies in respect to the private soldiers.
These spies threw themselves in the way of
the soldiers, enticed them into public-houses, plied
them with drink, and, in an apparently frank and
off-hand manner, questioned them as to their political
opinions. Some of the gallant privates, thus
treated and interrogated, and little thinking that
they were in the fangs of the Government <em>mouchards</em>,
candidly expressed their sympathy with the
popular cause, and as generously declared that
they would sooner cut their hands off than draw a
trigger against the people&mdash;adding, “The working-men
and the soldiers are brethren.” What was
the consequence? The spies followed these brave
and open-hearted men home to their barracks, and
laid information against them; so that numbers of
British soldiers, thus shamefully entrapped, found
themselves suddenly placed under arrest. Their
commanding officers did not dare bring them to
punishment; but they are doubtless marked men,
and will be persecuted with all imaginable rancour
and bitterness. To conclude this portion of our observations,
we must remark that if any disturbance
had really occurred on the great public occasion
now especially alluded to, the troops were resolved
<em>not</em> to fire upon the people; but they were equally
determined to avenge themselves most signally upon
the police.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The day has gone by for the British soldier to
permit himself to be made the tool of despotism: he
will not be behind the French soldier in noble sentiments,
generous conduct, and enlightened feelings,
any more than he is inferior to him in bravery or
discipline. But the British soldier must have his
wrongs boldly proclaimed and speedily redressed.
In many, if not in most regiments, the love of self-improvement
is looked upon by the officers as a
crime; whereas reading should be encouraged as
much as possible. The barrack-room should be
made more comfortable: at present it is so miserable
and cheerless, that the private soldier is driven
to the public-house in spite of his better inclinations.
In many instances, men have become drunkards
from this very fact, and are then entered in the
Proscribed List; though all this might be avoided,
were they encouraged to remain and pass their
evenings at home. The food provided for the mess-tables
is seldom of a good description, and frequently
of the very worst: the meat especially is too often
of the vilest kind, and unfit for human food. Yet
the poor soldier dares not complain&mdash;no, not even
in respect to that for the supply of which he is so
heavily mulcted out of his miserable pittance.
Drunkenness even every now and then is a heinous
crime in respect to the private soldier; whereas the
veriest stripling that was ever dubbed ensign or
cornet, may get as tipsy as an owl every night of his
life with utter impunity. In fine, the condition of the
British soldier is wretched in the extreme; and
while the officer, who <em>buys</em> his rank, enjoys every
privilege and riots in luxury and dissipation, the
unfortunate private, who is basely inveigled into the
service by a damnable fraud, is persecuted for the
slightest offence, and treated on all occasions as a
mere dog.</p>

<p>And now to return to our narrative. Six months
elapsed; and during that period Leonard and Ellen
met as often as the duties of the former would
permit, while the latter cared not to what extent
her husband’s suspicions were aroused by her frequent
and unaccountable absences from home. And
that the old man did speedily entertain the most
heart-rending suspicions, was a fact: but if he
questioned his wife, she either took refuge in a
stubborn silence, or answered him in a manner
that only provoked him the more. Pride prevented
him from complaining to her father; and he felt
that he was now righteously punished for his selfishness
in sacrificing the happiness of the fair young
creature to his own desires. At length, unable any
longer to endure the tortures of uncertainty, and
anxious to know the worst at once, or else acquire
the conviction that he had misjudged his wife altogether,
he watched her movements: but she, aware
of his proceeding, and without affecting to notice it,
adopted such precautions as completely to outwit
her husband, and to hold meetings with her lover,
undiscovered as before. Up to this period&mdash;nearly
three years and a half&mdash;the young man had conducted
himself in his regiment with the utmost steadiness:
he had never been reported&mdash;never incurred the
slightest reprimand from his superiors. This was
an extraordinary case, inasmuch as the private soldier
has so many persons to please: first, the corporal&mdash;then
the serjeant&mdash;then the serjeant-major&mdash;then
the subaltern of the troop&mdash;next the captain&mdash;and
lastly the commanding-officer. No&mdash;not
<em>lastly</em>: for he must likewise please the Regimental
Serjeant-Major, the Adjutant, and the Riding
Master. Well, all these difficult objects had Leonard
accomplished with success; and he was likewise
beloved by all his comrades. He was ever in barracks
of an evening at the proper hour; and during
the first six months of his amour with Ellen, not
even her sweet society had caused him to be late.</p>

<p>We must state that the more completely to enjoy
the company of her lover, Ellen Gamble had
taken a furnished lodging in the neighbourhood of
his barracks; and there they were wont to meet.
The landlady of the place asked no questions, her
rent being regularly paid, and so little use being
made of the apartments. It was Ellen’s delight to
provide succulent suppers for Leonard; and these
he did not hesitate to partake of with her: but as
for direct pecuniary assistance&mdash;when once she had
offered it in as delicate a manner as possible, he
refused it with so much firmness and with such a
glowing countenance that she did not again allude to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
the subject. One evening,&mdash;it was at the expiration
of the six months already alluded to&mdash;the conversation
had become more than ordinarily interesting to the
pair&mdash;the supper was later than usual&mdash;and Ellen
had ordered a bottle of champagne by way of an additional
treat. Leonard was remarkably temperate
in his habits; and the wine excited him considerably.
He was not however tipsy&mdash;only very much
animated; and the time passed away more rapidly
than the lovers had imagined. At length, a neighbouring
clock proclaimed the hour when Leonard
should be in quarters: and, starting up, he snatched
a hasty embrace, and hurried away. He reached
the barracks ten minutes after the proper time; and
as he was traversing the yard, deeply regretting that
he should be even such a trifle too late, he met a
young cornet who had only joined the regiment six
weeks previously. “Holloa, you sir!” cried Lord
Satinet; for such was the officer’s appellation:
“what the devil do you mean by coming in at this
hour?”&mdash;Leonard, perceiving that his lordship was
so tipsy as to be scarcely able to stand, endeavoured
to get away without making any answer.&mdash;“Stop
there, damn your eyes!” exclaimed the nobleman.
“What’s your number? Oh! B 57. Very well.
But, damn your eyes!” repeated his lordship;
“you’re drunk&mdash;as drunk as a beast, I declare.”&mdash;“I
am not, my lord!” cried Leonard, indignantly:
and again he made for the door leading to his
quarters.&mdash;“You infernal scoundrel!” vociferated
the splendid specimen of aristocracy, flying
into a furious passion: “how dare you tell
me you are not drunk? Why, curse you, you
can hardly stand.” It was his lordship, however,
who staggered.&mdash;“I am sober, my lord,”
responded Leonard, still keeping his temper: “and
pray permit me to inform your lordship that I <em>once</em>
was a gentleman, and that your lordship might
have a little more consideration for a person so unfortunately
circumstanced as I am!”&mdash;“A gentleman
<em>once</em>!” repeated Lord Satinet, with an ironical
laugh: “a pretty gentleman, I’ll be bound! Your
father was a costermonger, I suppose; and your
mother an apple-woman? A gentleman, indeed!
Why, damn your eyes, you’ll be telling me you
were a nobleman next. A gentleman, by the
powers! a splendid gentleman! Of the swell-mob,
most likely.”&mdash;“Were I now as I was three years
and a half ago, my lord,” said Leonard, scarcely
able to master his passion, “you would not dare to
address me thus.”&mdash;“Holloa! you threaten me,
eh!” cried Lord Satinet. “Come, sir: tramp off
to the guard-room; and I’ll teach you what it is to
insult your officer, and be damned to you!”</p>

<p>Poor Leonard was compelled to obey: but the
mere circumstance of being forced to restrain his
boiling indignation, gave him such an excited appearance,
that when he arrived at the guard-room the
Serjeant on duty immediately accused him of having
been drinking. Leonard scorned to utter a falsehood;
and he did not therefore deny the fact: but he declared
that he was not inebriated&mdash;a statement
which was treated with ridicule. To be brief, he
was kept in custody for three days, at the expiration
of which a court-martial assembled to try
him. Lord Satinet made out the case as black as
possible against the unfortunate young man, who
in his defence most unwisely but very truly averred
that his lordship himself was excessively tipsy on
the occasion referred to. The nobleman denied the
statement with much apparent indignation; and
the judge-advocate declared that Leonard Mitchell
had materially aggravated his own enormity by such
an accusation&mdash;although the very officer who thus
fulfilled the judicial functions could of himself have
proved, had he chosen, that Lord Satinet <em>was</em> particularly
disguised in liquor on the night in question.
The result of that hideous mockery of a trial
was that the accused was pronounced <em>guilty</em> of
returning home late in a condition of extreme intoxication,
and of grossly insulting and even
menacing his officer. Leonard Mitchell was accordingly
condemned to receive three hundred
lashes with the cat-o’nine-tails: he was then removed
to the black hole, where he passed a night
scarcely enviable even by a man about to suffer the
extreme penalty of the law. For, oh! how could
he ever again look the world in the face?&mdash;how
should he dare meet his much-loved Ellen? how
survive this deep disgrace&mdash;this flagrant shame&mdash;this
damning infamy? But we dare not pause to
analyse the thoughts or describe the feelings of the
wretched young man during the interval between
his condemnation and the execution of the sentence.</p>

<p>The fatal moment arrived when the gallant British
soldier, stripped naked to the waist, was tied up to
receive the torture of the lash, in the presence of the
entire regiment, which was marshalled for the purpose.
Leonard’s face was ashy pale&mdash;but the compressed
lip, sternly-fixed eye, and determined expression
of countenance indicated his resolution to
meet the horrible punishment with as much courage
as he could invoke to his aid. On many an eye-lash
in the ranks did the tear of sympathy&mdash;aye, of
deep, deep commiseration tremble: but the officers
looked on, the elder ones without emotion&mdash;the
younger with curiosity, but with no better feeling.
As for Cornet Lord Satinet&mdash;he could scarcely
conceal his delight at the inhuman spectacle which
he himself had caused to be enacted; and he
thought what a “lion of the party” he should prove
in the evening at his father’s house, when detailing
to his noble mamma and his dear sisters the particulars
of the military flogging of the morning.
But, hark! the drums beat&mdash;and the accursed torture
commences!&mdash;the first blow is inflicted&mdash;and
nine long livid marks appear upon the back of the
victim. Still he winces not&mdash;and not a murmur
escapes his lips. Again does the lash fall&mdash;and of
a livelier red are the traces it leaves behind. A
third time the instrument of torture descends&mdash;and
now blood is drawn. But still the young man is
silent&mdash;although his well-knit frame moves with a
slight convulsiveness. A shudder&mdash;passing throughout
the long ranks like an electric shock, from
flank to flank&mdash;denotes the horror&mdash;the profound,
intense horror, which strikes to the hearts of the
brave dragoons who behold the appalling laceration
of their comrade. And now faster falls each murderous
weapon&mdash;for there are two executioners employed
at the same time: and when they have dealt
a certain number of blows, they are relieved by
others, so that the victim may gain nothing by the
slightest weariness of arm on the part of his torturers.
Still he maintains a profound silence: but
he cannot prevent his countenance from expressing
a keen sense of the mortal agony that he endures.
Down&mdash;down comes the horrible weapon, each
stroke inflicting <em>nine</em> distinct blows; and, while the
blood streams forth in many crimson rivulets, the
knotted cords carry away pieces of the palpitating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
flesh. Oh! that such infernal cruelty should be
perpetrated in a country vaunted as the chosen land
of freedom, and peopled by beings who boast their
humanity!&mdash;Oh! that such a blood-thirsty torture
should be sanctioned by the laws of a nation paying
upwards of ten millions a-year for the maintenance
of the ministers of Christ! Gracious God! do thy
thunders sleep when a creature fashioned after thine
own image is thus enduring the torments of the
damned,&mdash;torments inflicted not in a paroxysm of
rage, and by the hand of a savage individual vengeance,&mdash;but
in cold blood, in unprovoked mercilessness,
and under colour of a sanguinary law which would
disgrace a community of savages! People of England!
let us blush&mdash;let us hang down our heads for
very shame when we reflect that such appalling scenes
are enacted amongst us; or rather let us gnash
our teeth with rage&mdash;and tear our hair&mdash;and beat
our breasts, to think that we are unable to compel
our legislators to receive even a scintillation of
that humane spirit which animates ourselves. For
we have a Society to prevent cruelty to animals&mdash;and
the man who beats his ox or his ass too severely,
is punished; and if a poor man only happens
to jostle against a police-officer, it is construed into
<em>a savage assault</em> and attended with penalties. But
there is no Society to prevent cruelty to human
beings; and the lash&mdash;the accursed lash may be
used, until the blood flows down the back&mdash;the
skin is flayed away&mdash;deep wails are made in the
quivering form&mdash;morsels of palpitating flesh are
torn off&mdash;and the muscles are laid bare,&mdash;oh! all
this may be done&mdash;all these revolting atrocities may
be perpetrated&mdash;all these hellish cruelties may be
accomplished, and there is no Association patronised
by Royal Highnesses, Bishops, and Noble
Lords, to interfere in behalf of the victims nor to
punish the offenders!</p>

<p>Leonard Mitchell bore his murderous punishment
as bravely as man could endure such fiendish torture.
A hundred and fifty lashes had been inflicted,
without eliciting a moan from his lips: but his
countenance betrayed all the intensity of the
anguish which he suffered. His eyes lost their
lustre&mdash;his under-jaw fell slightly&mdash;there was foam
upon his mouth&mdash;and his tongue protruded somewhat.
As for his back&mdash;&mdash;But, perdition seize
upon the blood-hounds! the indignation which we
feel at this moment will not allow us to extend <em>that</em>
portion of the painful description. Better&mdash;oh!
better far to be the vilest beggar that ever grovelled
in the mire, than one of those Greenacres of the
House of Commons who advocate corporal punishment,
or those Barkers of colonels who delight in
having it inflicted! As for poor Leonard Mitchell,
he received upwards of two hundred lashes without
a murmur; and then the surgeon ordered a pause.
Drink was given to him&mdash;and he revived. But was
he then removed? Oh! no&mdash;no: the feast of blood
was not accomplished&mdash;the cup of gore was not full
enough&mdash;the sum of human tortures was not finished.
Again fell the accursed weapon: and now&mdash;we
know not whether it were that after a brief cessation
the agony of the renewal was more intense
than before&mdash;or that the interval of rest had allowed
the fine spirit of the man to flag,&mdash;whatever were
the cause, it is nevertheless a fact that a piercing
shriek of anguish burst from his lips&mdash;a shriek so
strange, so wild, and so unnatural, that long, long
after did it ring in the ears of those who heard it;
for it seemed to lacerate the very brain as, in its
horrible inflections, the rending sound was sent
back from the barrack walls in penetrating echoes
and frightful reverberations. A thrill of horror
electrified the startled ranks of the victim’s comrades;
and the gloved hand of many a brave soldier
was drawn rapidly across the countenance, to dash
away the tears that trembled on the quivering eye-lids.
For, oh! the British warrior may indeed well
weep at such a scene,&mdash;weep&mdash;weep with mingled
shame and sorrow&mdash;weep, too, with bitterness and
indignation!</p>

<p>The punishment was over: soon as that piercing
scream had died away, the prisoner fainted;&mdash;and he
was forthwith hurried to the infirmary, where many
hours elapsed ere he came to his senses. Then he
awoke to consciousness amidst the most horrible
tortures: for the means that were adopted to prevent
his lacerated back from mortifying, inflicted
the agonies of hell. Only fancy, Christian reader&mdash;a
man in this country can be beaten into such a
state that it is ten to one whether he will not die
of his wounds, and all the surgeon’s art can with
difficulty resuscitate him! But pass we over the
lingering illness endured by the unhappy Leonard&mdash;-an
illness of eight long weeks; and let us see whether
the tortures of the lash have made him a better
man. Alas! far from it! His fine spirit was broken:
he saw that it was useless to endeavour to be good&mdash;that
it was ridiculous to practise virtues which experienced
no reward. His religious faith was shaken&mdash;nay,
almost completely destroyed; and he no
longer believed in the efficacy of prayer. Instead
of harbouring feelings of a generous philanthropy,
he began to loathe and detest his superiors and look
with suspicion on his equals. A doggedness of disposition,
a recklessness of character, a species of indifference
as to what might become of him, displaced
all those fine qualities and noble attributes that had
previously graced him. For he felt that he was a
marked man in his regiment, and never could hope
for promotion&mdash;that his character was gone&mdash;and
that, like Cain, he bore about him the brand of indelible
infamy. Moreover, he longed for vengeance&mdash;bitter,
bitter vengeance upon that young scion of
the aristocracy who had lied against him&mdash;lied foully
as only such a wretch could lie&mdash;and who had
brought down all that disgrace on his devoted head.</p>

<p>In such a frame of mind was it that Leonard
Mitchell met Ellen for the first time after a separation
of nearly ten weeks. The young lady had
learnt the misfortunes which had befallen her lover;
and she was prepared, by an intimate knowledge of
his character, to hear that he had been accused as
unjustly as he had been punished savagely. She
endeavoured to console him: but he assured her
broadly and frankly that the only solace he could
ever know was&mdash;<em>vengeance</em>! Ellen did not discourage
this idea&mdash;did not rebuke this craving; for
she also felt bitterly&mdash;bitterly against the despicable
lordling who had persecuted him so foully. It was,
nevertheless, with sorrow that she soon observed
the alteration which had taken place in his disposition.
He was still devoted to her: but his passion
now partook rather of a gross sensuality than,
of the refinement of love. How could it be otherwise?
The best feelings of the man were blunted;
and his brute impulses, unchecked by that delicacy
of sentiment which had once so peculiarly characterised
him, became the more violent. Especially
did he soon manifest a loving for intoxicating
liquors; and at the third or fourth interview
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
with Ellen, after his release from the hospital, he
suffered her to understand pretty plainly that he
should no longer refuse pecuniary assistance at her
hands. In the course of a few weeks he spoke out
more plainly still, and unblushingly asked for the
amount he required at the time; and ere many months
had passed away, he never parted from her without
receiving a portion of the contents of her purse. At
first she herself was much shocked at this evidence
of an altered disposition: but she was so deeply&mdash;so
devotedly attached to him, that she reasoned
herself into consolation even on that head; and the
more selfish he became, the more anxious did she
appear to minister to his wants. This was not all:
for frequent intoxication irritated his temper&mdash;and
he did not hesitate to vent his ill humour upon her.
Sometimes, too, he failed to keep his appointments
with her: and when they did meet at last, he abused
her if she dared to reproach him. On one occasion
he actually raised his hand to strike her; but the
poor, loving creature, falling on her knees at his
feet, turned up towards him a countenance so tearful
and woe-begone, that the coward blow was
stayed, and he implored her pardon. Nevertheless,
she had received a shock which she could not forget:
neither could she avoid contrasting the
Leonard Mitchell whom military punishment had
degraded to the same level as the brutes, with the
Leonard Mitchell who formerly appeared the very
type of a gallant, generous-hearted, and high-minded
British Dragoon!</p>

</div>

<p>But Leonard Mitchell must not be blamed if his
manners and habits were thus changed, and if he
took inveterately to drinking. He was one of those
whom bad laws had forced into evil courses; and if
he flew to the intoxicating glass, it was because the
alcoholic liquor contained the hours of oblivion.
Persecuted as he had been&mdash;degraded as he felt
himself, existence had become intolerable unless he
lost the consciousness of at least a portion of it.
His comrades noticed the alteration which had
taken place in him, and they well understood the
cause: for it had been the same with every one
who had ever undergone the torture and the disgrace
of the lash. In his sober hours Leonard
experienced no remorse&mdash;no compunction for the
ways which he was pursuing: he had grown dogged&mdash;morose&mdash;indifferent;&mdash;no&mdash;not
altogether indifferent,&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
he cherished&mdash;dearly, deeply cherished
a scheme of vengeance. And the day and the
hour for carrying it into execution arrived at
last.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, on the anniversary of the memorable
morning of his degrading punishment, that a
grand review took place in Hyde Park. Certain
German pauper Princes were on a visit to this country,&mdash;princes
who received annual incomes from the
English Treasury, heaven only knows for what services
performed&mdash;and whose very travelling expenses
to and from the Court of St. James’s were duly paid
from the public purse;&mdash;for those contemptible petty
sovereigns of Germany are as mean as they are poor,
and as proud as they are both mean and poor!
Well, it was on the occasion of the presence of two
or three of those princely beggars in the British
metropolis, that the grand review took place. All
the troops quartered in or near London were
marched shortly after ten o’clock in the morning to
Hyde Park; and as the day was remarkably fine,
the spectacle was brilliant and imposing. The Duke
of Wellington, the German Princes, and several
General-officers, attended by a numerous staff,
shortly afterwards appeared upon the ground: and
the road was thronged with spectators. The review
commenced in the usual manner: the entire force,
infantry and cavalry, was drawn up to receive the
Duke, the Princes, and their companions;&mdash;and
after the inspection and the “marching past,” various
evolutions and manœuvres were practised. A sham
fight was then ordered; and the troops were accordingly
separated for the purpose into two divisions.
The appearance of the dragoon regiment in which
Leonard Mitchell served attracted general notice,
not only on account of the reputation it had acquired
of containing some of the finest men in the British
army, but likewise in consequence of its discipline
and its perfection in the evolutions already practised.
But had some searching eye scanned each
individual countenance, there was <em>one</em> in that regiment
which would have rivetted the gaze: for,
though strikingly handsome, there was then upon
that countenance an expression of fiend-like satisfaction
and sardonic triumph&mdash;and the portentous
gaze, the curling lip, and the dilation of the nostrils
on the part of the dragoon thus alluded to, would
have convinced the observer that the man’s thoughts
were intent on some sinister design.</p>

<p>And now the sham-fight commences;&mdash;and
there is advancing and retreating by turns&mdash;and
there are echelons and deployings, and other evolutions&mdash;until
a general attack commences on the
side of the assailing party. The dragoons are armed
with their carbines; and Leonard Mitchell grasps
his weapon with an ardour&mdash;an affection&mdash;a species
of gratitude, as if it were about to render him some
signal service. The order is given to fire; and the
carbines vomit forth volumes of white, vapoury
smoke, which in a moment envelopes the entire
corps. But from the midst of the cloud a piercing
scream&mdash;a scream of mortal agony&mdash;breaks forth;
and then, as the smoke moves slowly away on the
lazy wing of the partial breeze, ejaculations of
horror and dismay announce that some accident
has occurred. All is now confusion; but a report
spreads through the dragoon regiment, and thence
circulates like wildfire amidst the troops and the
spectators, that Lord Satinet has been wounded in
the sham-fight. And true enough was the rumour;
for there lay the young nobleman, fallen from his
horse, and stretched bleeding and gasping on the
green sward! The surgeon hastily proceeded to
render all the assistance that human skill could
administer: but the aid was vain and useless&mdash;the
victim was mortally wounded by a bullet which
had entered his back&mdash;and, without uttering an intelligible
word, he shortly expired in the surgeon’s
arms. And now a sad and heart-rending scene
took place: for the parents and the sisters of the
murdered nobleman were upon the ground&mdash;and
they hastened to the spot, guided by the common
rumour which had appalled them, but which they
hoped to find incorrect, or at all events fearfully
exaggerated. They discovered, however, that it
was, alas! too true; and the gala day was turned
into one of bitter mourning for them. The review
was broken up&mdash;and the troops were marched away
to their respective barracks; while the spectators
crowded to behold the sad procession that bore the
corpse of the young noble to the family mansion in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>During the return of the dragoon regiment to
its quarters, those of Leonard’s comrades who were
near him frequently bent suspicious and enquiring
glances upon him: but his countenance afforded
no indication of guilt. He neither appeared triumphant
nor downcast&mdash;neither nervous nor
afraid; and the soldiers who thus beheld his calm
and tranquil demeanour, were shaken in the idea
which they had formed in respect to the authorship
of the morning’s tragedy. The moment the dragoons
entered the barracks, every cartouche-box
was examined; but in none was found aught save
blank cartridges. The suspicions of the officers had
naturally fallen upon Leonard Mitchell; and it
was deemed necessary to place him under arrest
until the coroner should have instituted the usual
enquiry. But he energetically declared his innocence;
and those who were the most ready to suspect
him, were staggered by the sincerity which
seemed to characterise his protestations, and by the
indignation which he manifested at the crime imputed
to him. On the ensuing day the inquest
was held; and the result was favourable to Mitchell.
No particle of evidence appeared to tell
against him, unless indeed it were the fact that he
had been flogged a year previously through the
instrumentality of the deceased nobleman. But
none of Leonard’s comrades who were examined,
could aver that they had ever heard him use a
threatening expression in respect to Lord Satinet&mdash;no,
not even in his cups, when the truth is so
likely to slip from a man’s lips and the real state
of his feelings to be proclaimed by the tongue.
That the nobleman’s death was the result of an
accident, was an alternative that could scarcely be
adopted: for it was almost impossible that a ball-cartridge
could have been mistaken for a blank
one. Thus, though not a tittle of testimony could
be brought against Leonard Mitchell,&mdash;and though
he was discharged from custody,&mdash;yet in the minds
of all the officers and of many of his comrades,
there still dwelt a suspicion with regard to him.
An open verdict was returned by the jury,&mdash;to the
effect that “the deceased had met his death by a
ball discharged from a carbine, but whether by
accident or guilty intent, and by what hand, was
unknown.” A few days afterwards the remains of
the young nobleman were consigned to the tomb;
and the Tory newspapers, in passing an eulogium
upon his character, grouped together such a variety
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
of admirable qualities, that if he had only possessed
one-tenth of them, he must have been a
phœnix of moral perfection and a prodigy of intellectual
power.</p>

<p>The first meeting which took place between
Leonard Mitchell and Ellen after the tragedy just
related, was of a painful description. Scarcely were
they alone together in the apartment which she had
hired for these guilty interviews, when, seizing him
violently by the wrist, and speaking in a low, thick
tone&mdash;while her eyes looked fixedly and searchingly
into the depths of his own&mdash;she said, “Leonard, is
it possible that you have done this?”&mdash;“I told you
that I would have vengeance,” he replied, almost
brutally, as he abruptly withdrew his arm from her
grasp; “and you have even encouraged me in the
project. Do you mean to reproach me now?”&mdash;“Oh!
my God, it seems so horrible to contemplate!”
cried Ellen, sinking into a chair, and pressing her
hands to her throbbing brows: for, criminal&mdash;almost
depraved, though she were, yet she was not so
hardened as to be able to stifle the still small voice
which whispered in her ears, “<em>Thou art the companion
of a murderer!</em>”&mdash;“Horrible to contemplate!”
repeated Leonard, with a brutal laugh.
“You are a fool to talk in that style, Ellen. But
perhaps you will go and betray me next?”&mdash;“Good
heavens! how have I merited such treatment as
this?” exclaimed the wretched woman, now bursting
into a flood of tears. “Have I not sacrificed
everything for you, Leonard?” she demanded, her
voice broken with agonising sobs: “and can you
find it in your heart to insult me thus? Oh! consider
my position, and have mercy upon me! Tormented
day and night by the suspicions and the increasing
ill-humour of a husband whom I loathe
and abhor&mdash;with the greatest difficulty avoiding the
snares which he sets to entrap me, and to acquire
proof of that infidelity which he even more than
suspects and subjected latterly to the questions
and remonstrances of my father, who has at length
obtained a knowledge of my frequent and unaccounted-for
absences from home,&mdash;think you not
that I am sufficiently unhappy, perplexed, and bewildered,
without receiving insult and injury from
you?”&mdash;“Then why do you provoke me?” demanded
Leonard. “For a year past I have been constantly
telling you that I would have vengeance; and, as I
said just now, you have encouraged me in the idea.
But now that it is consummated, and that my mortal
enemy sleeps in a premature grave, you affect
horror and disgust.”&mdash;“Oh! Leonard,” ejaculated
Ellen, throwing herself at his feet, “pardon me, and
I will offend you no more! I am well aware that the
provocation was immense, and that there are circumstances
in which human forbearance knows no limit&mdash;can
acknowledge no restraint. Such was your
position; and I was wrong to utter a word deprecatory
of your conduct.”&mdash;“Well, well,” said
Leonard, raising the infatuated woman from her
suppliant posture, and placing her on the sofa by
his side: “let us talk no more of this little quarrel
between us. For you must be aware that I should
have been worse than the spaniel which licks the
hand that beats it, if I had not avenged myself on
that miscreant lordling, whom my hatred accompanies
even in his grave. And let me tell you, that
in times of war, many and many an officer is picked
off by some soldier who has felt the iron hand of
despotism press upon him, or who has suffered from
the effects of individual persecution. It may be
called <em>murder</em>, if you choose: but I look upon it
as a <em>righteous retribution</em>.”&mdash;Ellen gazed in mingled
astonishment and horror, and with a ghastly pallor
of countenance, upon her lover’s face, as he enunciated
this dreadful doctrine: then, perceiving that
he was again about to become angry, she hastened
to caress him. He returned the amorous dalliance;
but Ellen could no longer abandon herself wholly
and entirely to the delights of illicit love. Though
the course of life which she had for some time
adopted had rendered her insatiably sensual, she
now experienced a feeling of loathing and disgust
when in contact with her lover. This feeling she
strove hard to conquer, by conjuring up all the
voluptuous ideas that had ever existed in her soul:
but, in spite of this straining against nature, a voice
of blood seemed to ring in her ears, warning her
that she was in the arms of a murderer! She gazed
upon his handsome countenance, in the hope that
its beauty would inspire her with sentiments of a
purer affection;&mdash;but his eyes appeared to beam
with fiendish triumph and demoniac malignity;&mdash;and
if she pressed his hand to her lips, it seemed as
if she were kissing flesh stained with human gore.</p>

<p>Unable to endure these torturing feelings, she
hastened to prepare the supper-table, and bade him
draw the cork of a champagne-bottle. Full readily
did he comply; and, having tossed off a bumper
first, he refilled the same glass, saying, “Now drink
from this, to convince me that you do not love me
less on account of what has happened.”&mdash;The lady
took the glass and placed it to her lips: but the
words he had just uttered, recalled so vividly to her
mind those images which she had striven so forcibly
to banish from her imagination, that an invincible
feeling of disgust came over her&mdash;a blood-mist appeared
to obscure her sight&mdash;and as she drank, it
seemed as if a draught from a sanguine tide were
pouring down her throat. Nevertheless, she forced
herself to drain the glass; and as soon as the exciting
liquor began to circulate in her veins, these
horrible images rapidly disappeared, and she felt
that she could now abandon herself to a voluptuousness
of soul unmarred by disgust or loathing. Ellen,
therefore, as well as Leonard, discovered that there
were charms in the crystal cup filled with sparkling
wine; and she drank the exciting juice with the
avidity of one who knows full well its efficacy in
banishing care. Leonard was both surprised and
rejoiced to behold the influence which the nectar
had upon her; and for a long time he had not appeared
so tender and affectionate as he was during
the latter part of this interview.</p>

<p>And what was the consequence of that evening’s
incidents? That Ellen took a liking to alcoholic
liquor. She had discovered therein a panacea for
disagreeable thoughts; and her reflections in serious
moments were by no means of a pleasurable nature.
Thus was it that she, who was lately so abstemious
as scarcely to touch a drop of wine even after dinner,
and who had so deeply deplored the weakness
of Leonard in yielding to the insidious temptations
of strong drink,&mdash;thus was it that she, the elegant
and lovely Ellen, gave way to that same fascination,
and sought solace in the sparkling glass. At first
she touched no wine until the dinner-hour: but she
soon found that all the morning and afternoon she
was a prey to low spirits, distressing reflections,
and feelings of mingled loathing and fondness in
respect to Leonard; and she therefore made the
mid-day luncheon an excuse for taking her first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
glass. At dinner-time she would freely partake of
her two or three glasses;&mdash;and on those evenings
when she met Leonard, she indulged readily in the
liquor provided for the supper-table. But as the
habit rapidly gained upon the unfortunate young
woman, she soon began to tipple slily at home;
and, even before breakfast, she eventually found
herself compelled by great mental depression to
imbibe a dram. It was about this time that Mr.
Gamble’s intellects, racked and tortured for upwards
of a year by the most harrowing suspicions
and by the total estrangement of his wife’s affections
and even attentions, began to give way; and
he would sit for hours together in his chair, with
his eyes fixed upon vacancy. It was also at the
same epoch that a turn once more manifested itself
in Mr. Pomfret’s affairs; and, a colossal speculation
failing, he was again plunged into deep embarrassments.
Further assistance from his son-in-law
was out of the question; and Mr. Pomfret accordingly
devoted all his energies to sustain the credit
of his house in the hope that he might yet retrieve
himself, or in any case postpone the catastrophe
for as long a period as possible. Thus the condition
of her husband and the constant application
of her father to his business left Ellen almost
totally free from any supervision; and she was
enabled to indulge at will in the fatal habit that
was gaining so rapidly upon her. Leonard did
not fail to notice this growing attachment to
liquor on her part; and he rather encouraged it
than otherwise&mdash;for he himself had become utterly
depraved and reckless, and when his mistress was
in a maudlin condition of semi-ebriety, she cheerfully
parted with all the contents of her purse.
The increasing childishness of her husband gave her
a greater command over his finances; and she was
therefore the better able to supply her lover’s extravagances.
At length she acquired the certainty
that Leonard was unfaithful to her; and a desperate
quarrel was the consequence. Nor was the dispute
confined to mere words; for the young man beat
her unmercifully&mdash;and she, half intoxicated at the
time, retaliated to the best of her ability. The
scene was shocking and disgusting; and when Ellen
awoke next morning, and reflected upon all that
had occurred on the preceding evening, she wept
bitter&mdash;bitter tears, as she compared the guilty present
with the innocent past. Then she vowed to
abstain from liquor in future, and to see Leonard
Mitchell no more; and, temporarily strong in this
resolution, she sent him a note communicating her
design. Moreover, under the influence of the better
feelings that were thus awakening within her soul,
her heart smote her for her conduct towards her
husband, who was daily becoming more dependant
upon her kindness, and whom she had long neglected
altogether. She even felt happy when she
pondered upon her newly-formed determination to
resume a steady course of life;&mdash;but all her salutary
schemes and hopes were annihilated in the afternoon
of that same day, by the arrival of a letter
from Mitchell, threatening to murder her and kill
himself afterwards unless she repaired in the evening
to the usual place of meeting.</p>

<p>Over that letter Ellen wept scalding tears&mdash;for
she knew that if she yielded <em>now</em>, her fate was
sealed: ruin, degradation, and disgrace must inevitably
await her! She saw herself again entering
upon the path which would lead her to the condition
of a confirmed drunkard; and the awful
menaces contained in the missive, filled her with
presentiments that even her death might be premature
and violent. Nevertheless, she had not the
moral courage to resist the temptation of meeting
her lover; and she consoled herself&mdash;or rather, she
endeavoured to quiet her qualms of conscience and
her presaging fears&mdash;by saying, “It shall be for the
last time!” To the place of appointment she
accordingly went; and Leonard Mitchell, who
feared to lose a mistress possessed of such ample
means to minister to his extravagances, played the
hypocrite so admirably that Ellen&mdash;infatuated
creature that she was!&mdash;believed in the sincerity of
his protestations of undivided love for the future,
and his regrets for the past. The wine-bottle circulated
freely; and she forgot all her remorse&mdash;all
her compunctions&mdash;all her resolves of reformation.
She even went so far as to revive the proposal of
purchasing Leonard’s discharge; but to this he
positively refused to accede. He quoted his oath
as a reason: it was not however the correct one&mdash;for
even that solemn vow had long ceased to have
any influence upon his depraved and hardened
mind. The truth was that he had become a confirmed
voluptuary in respect to women; and he
found that his uniform was an immense auxiliary
towards success with the frivolous and giddy of
the sex: moreover, he knew that were he released
from the ranks, he should become completely
tacked to the apron-strings of his mistress; and,
as she held the purse, he would not in that case be
able to exercise his independence. It therefore
suited him better to remain in the army; and
Ellen was foolish&mdash;infatuated enough to believe in
the validity and genuineness of the motive which
he alleged for declining her proposal. She accordingly
forbore from pressing it; and the remainder
of that evening was spent in voluptuous enjoyment&mdash;sensuality
and champagne constituting the
elements of that guilty pair’s unhallowed pleasures.</p>

<p>Time passed on; and the position of the lovers&mdash;if
such they could now be called&mdash;became daily more
unhappy in respect to each other. Quarrels between
them were of constant occurrence; and on each occasion
blows were exchanged. The affection of Ellen
had changed into a gross sensuality, having lost
every particle of refining sentiment; and she became
jealous in the extreme, frequently giving way
to such fits of passion, when she reproached Leonard
for his infidelities, that it was impossible to recognise
in the furious, rabid, half-drunken demoness&mdash;the
mild, amiable, and chaste young lady of former
years. She still retained her beauty to a marvellous
degree, in spite of the deep potations in which she
indulged and the slovenliness that had crept upon
her in respect to dress; and, as she was frequently
out in the streets late of an evening, after her interviews
with Leonard, she was subjected to the
licentious proposals of the “young men about town”
who are ever on the look-out for pretty women.
The result was that, although she yielded not to
such temptations, her mind became more thoroughly
depraved, by being robbed of every chastening
thought and feminine reflection; for, when
under the influence of liquor, she would frequently
converse with the rakes who accosted her in the
manner described. Leonard himself suddenly grew
jealous; and, having followed her one evening, he
caught her in discourse with a young gentleman
whom she had encountered more than once during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
her walks home. A dreadful scene ensued: and,
though Leonard at length suffered himself to be
appeased, simply because afraid of losing one whose
purse was so convenient to him, he nevertheless entertained
a firm but erroneous conviction, of her infidelity.
They therefore now harboured mutual
distrust, which on many occasions rose into absolute
loathing. Bad as Leonard was, and much as
he had encouraged her in her drinking habits, he
was nevertheless often disgusted when he beheld
her reeling under the influence of liquor, and when
he felt upon his face that breath which, now heated
with alcoholic fluid, was once so pure and balmy.
On her side, she could never divest herself of the
remembrance that she was consorting with a murderer;
and frequently&mdash;oh! how frequently, the
blood-mist would reappear before her eyes, and the
liquor would seem gore in her glass, and sanguine
stains would, in her heated imagination, dye his
hands! Thus wretchedly did their connexion progress,&mdash;she
still clinging to him through that infatuation
which often belongs to sensuality of soul&mdash;and
he still tolerating her because she possessed
the means of supplying his pocket.</p>

<p>At length matters had reached a crisis, at which
the amour was destined to have a most tragical
termination. Ellen was returning home one evening,
smarting under some insult which her lover
had put upon her, and labouring as usual under the
influence of wine, when she met the young gentleman
above alluded to. On this occasion his entreaties
were more urgent than ever; and she was
more pliant than he had as yet found her to be.
Her blood was inflamed; and she was moreover in
that humour when to assert her independence of
Leonard, even to herself, would prove a solace and
a comfort. She accordingly yielded to the proposals
of the stranger, and accompanied him to an improper
house. It was midnight when they issued forth;
and Ellen hastened homeward, having made an
appointment for another evening. In the middle of
Waterloo Bridge she heard hasty steps approaching
from behind: it was a clear, moonlit night&mdash;and
on turning her head, she beheld Leonard Mitchell
close at hand. A faintness came over her: she
instantly suspected&mdash;nay, felt certain that he had
watched her;&mdash;and, trembling with terrible apprehensions,
she sank upon a seat in one of the recesses.
In another moment the young dragoon was by her
side. For almost a minute he spoke not; and this
silence augmented her alarm. Raising her pale&mdash;her
haggard countenance, on which the moon-light
streamed in all its chaste and silvery purity, she
endeavoured to frame some question that would lead
to an explanation of his presence there: but her
lips refused utterance to the words that rose to
them. A mortal terror was upon her&mdash;a consternation,
as if she beheld the skeleton form of Death
hovering dimly in the obscure distance.</p>

<p>Taking her hand, and pressing it with convulsive
violence, Leonard said in a low and hollow tone,
“Now, Ellen, I have at last obtained ample proof
of your infidelity.”&mdash;“Mercy! mercy!” murmured
the young woman, as gazing rapidly up and down
the bridge, she saw that it was completely deserted.&mdash;“Oh!
I deserve it,” exclaimed Leonard, beating
his brow violently with his open palm: “I know
that I deserve it all! I have long entertained the
suspicion that such was the case: but now that I
have acquired the conviction, it seems too dreadful
to bear! Again, however, I say that I deserve it:
and yet, bad&mdash;vile&mdash;depraved as I am, I feel as if
my heart had received a mortal wound.”&mdash;“I take
Almighty God to witness, Leonard,” cried Ellen in
an impassioned tone, “that this is the first time I
have been unfaithful to you. Your conduct of the
evening wounded me so deeply, that I longed to
avenge myself&mdash;longed also to assert my independence
of you, even if only to the knowledge of
my own heart. By this I mean that I should have
felt triumphant in proving false to you, even though
you yourself were to remain ignorant of the proceeding.
And now if you will pardon me, I
promise never to err again. But, O Leonard&mdash;Leonard,
do treat me with at least a little kindness!”&mdash;and
as she uttered these words in a tone
of deep feeling and profound pathos, she flung
herself upon his breast, throwing her arms around
his neck in a paroxysm of reviving fondness. So
touching was her appeal, that it instantly brought
to his soul an overwhelming cloud of reminiscences
of all the harshness, brutality, and cowardly cruelty
of which he had been guilty towards her,&mdash;reminiscences,
too, of all her love for him&mdash;the sacrifices
she had made for him&mdash;the generosity of her
behaviour in his behalf. He recollected also&mdash;and
all in a moment as it were&mdash;that if she were
degraded by drink, and defiled by the hot breath of
licentiousness, she was pure and chaste as a wife
until he had sought her out on his return to London,&mdash;that
her fall, in fine, might be unmistakeably
traced to her fatal connexion with him. Then, too,
he recalled to mind his own condition when two
years previously he had crossed that bridge on his
way to snatch a glimpse of the three houses in
Stamford Street,&mdash;a condition which, unenviable as
he had then deemed it, was one of supreme happiness
compared with his present state. For the
mark of the branding lash was upon his back, and
the remorse of a murderer was in his heart; and he
knew himself to be a drunkard&mdash;a disgrace to his
regiment&mdash;a vile wretch, rioting in pleasures purchased
by the coin that he wrung from the woman
whom he ill-treated and abused. And, lastly, his
thoughts were reflected back to those times when
all was bright and smiling before him&mdash;when he
and Ellen were alike untainted by guilt, and the
willing votaries of virtue&mdash;when their loves were
innocent and chaste, and they would have started
back in horror and indignation had it been prophesied
to them that they were one day destined to
look upon each other with disgust. All these recollections
and reflections poured in, like an overwhelming
torrent, upon the mind of the young dragoon;
and his soul was softened&mdash;his heart, long so
hard, was touched&mdash;and, melting into tears, as he
felt the miserable woman clinging to him with resuscitated
fondness, he pressed her to his bosom,
exclaiming, “Ellen, I have wronged you deeply&mdash;deeply:
but can you&mdash;can you forgive me?”</p>

<p>The reconciliation was complete; and then Ellen,
animated by a sudden thought, exclaimed, “But,
gracious heavens! Leonard, you have absented yourself
from your quarters&mdash;and, hark! the clock
strikes one.”&mdash;The booming note of St. Paul’s iron
tongue had indeed fallen upon their ears while she
was yet speaking.&mdash;“I dare not return to the barracks
again,” said Leonard; and she felt that he
shuddered convulsively in her arms.&mdash;“But what
will you do?” she asked, diffidently.&mdash;“Anything!”
he cried: “anything! rather than be flogged again.”&mdash;“Flogged!”
repeated Ellen, now shuddering in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
her turn.&mdash;“Yes: I should be assuredly condemned
to that ignominy&mdash;that torture,” replied Mitchell.
“My conduct has for some time been so unsteady,
and I have been so often reported ‘<em>late</em>,’ that this time
nothing could save me from the <em>cat</em>. I have determined
not to return to the barracks,” he added,
doggedly.&mdash;“But what will you do?” again asked
Ellen.&mdash;“I know not,” he responded gloomily.
“Unless I can find some secure place wherein to
hide for a few days, until I may escape from the
country, I cannot tell what will become of me.”&mdash;“And
must you quit the country?” demanded
Ellen.&mdash;“Would you have me taken up as a deserter?”
asked Leonard bitterly. “My punishment
in that case would be worse than if I were now to
go back and submit to the result of a court-martial
on charges of irregularity, drunkenness, and late
hours.”&mdash;“Not for worlds would I have you return
under present circumstances,” cried Ellen, in an
impassioned tone: “much less have you eventually
incur the danger of being arrested as a deserter,
Leonard,” she added, after a few moments’ pause,
“if you leave the country, I will go with you.”&mdash;“I
thought that you would not abandon me,” exclaimed
the dragoon, pressing her closer to him. Then he
whispered something in her ears; and they conversed
in a very low tone for several minutes. At
length Ellen yielded to the plan which her lover
had suggested, but which had at first seemed fraught
with difficulties.&mdash;“Yes,” she said; “there is no
alternative&mdash;I must conceal you at my house. And
when I reflect, the two servants are devoted to me:
you may suppose that I have all along bribed them
heavily in order to induce them to wink at my irregularities;
and if they refused to become Mr.
Gamble’s spies in these times when he was in full
possession of his intellects, they will not betray me
now that he is half childish and does not question
them concerning me any more. Yes: It must be
so;&mdash;there is no choice left. Come at once: I possess
the latch-key, and can admit you without even
disturbing the servants. It will be sufficient to
make confidants of them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The reader may now understand that Ellen was
about to consummate her imprudence by taking her
paramour beneath her husband’s roof. When the
first moments of dissolving softness and better
feelings had passed away in respect to Leonard,
his selfishness again asserted its empire; and,
while determining to desert, he at the same time
bethought himself how he could still make Ellen’s
pecuniary means available for his own purpose.
His object was therefore to gain admittance into
the house&mdash;to ascertain the precise nature of her
resources and find out the amount of valuables she
could dispose of&mdash;and then induce her to elope with
him, having previously plundered her husband and
his dwelling of everything worth carrying off. We
have seen how far his diabolical and hastily formed
scheme succeeded. Two points were already
gained: she would admit him into the house&mdash;and
she had promised to accompany him to another
country. The robbery, he felt assured, he should
be enabled to reason her into: if not, menaces
could be effectually employed, no doubt. Such
was the design which the once upright and honourable
Leonard Mitchell now had in view; and he
chuckled inwardly at the scheme, as he walked
arm-in-arm with Ellen towards Stamford Street.
In ten minutes they reached Mr. Gamble’s house:
Ellen opened the street-door by means of the latch-key
which she had about her;&mdash;and the dragoon
passed, unobserved and noiselessly, to her bed-room&mdash;for
during the past eighteen months she
and her husband had occupied separate chambers.
The remainder of that night glided away: in the
morning Ellen admitted the two domestics to her
confidence; and as she at the same time slipped a
heavy bribe into their hands, they willingly promised
devotion to her interests. The day passed heavily
enough for the dragoon, who was accustomed to
exercise and bustle, and who could not endure the
idea of being pent up within the narrow limits of a
bed-room. He accordingly determined to put the
remainder of his scheme into execution without
delay; and he rejoiced when night once more
spread its sable wing over this hemisphere.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock: Mr. Gamble had long before
retired to rest&mdash;the servants had likewise sought
their chamber;&mdash;and Leonard was seated at table
with Ellen in the bedroom of the latter. A succulent
supper and rich wines were placed before them: the
curtains were drawn carefully over the windows;
and a lamp diffused a mellow lustre throughout the
apartment. Having eaten as much as he cared for,
Leonard filled a tumbler with sherry, which he
drank at a draught to inspire him with courage for
the part which he had now to play&mdash;for, by fair or
foul means, was he resolved to succeed. “Ellen,”
said he, after a pause, “we must quit the house to-night.”&mdash;“To-night!”
she exclaimed, in astonishment:
“wherefore this hurry?”&mdash;“In the first
place,” he replied, “because I cannot bear confinement
here; and secondly, because it may as well be
done now as a week or a month hence.”&mdash;“Let us
postpone our departure until to-morrow night,”
said Ellen, imploringly.&mdash;“Why so?”&mdash;“Because I
have not seen my father for many days,” she answered:
“he has been so much engaged in the City;
and I should wish to bid him farewell for ever, if
only mentally.”&mdash;“This is childish!” ejaculated
Leonard impatiently. “I thought you had lost all
respect for your father?”&mdash;“Oh! but I cannot forget
that he <em>is</em> my father,” responded Ellen, the tears
trickling down her cheeks: “and now that I have
made up my mind to leave England for ever, I would
embrace him once more.”&mdash;“Then I must depart
without you,” said Leonard, rising from his chair&mdash;“Oh!
this is unkind to a degree!” urged Ellen
bitterly. “Surely you can allow me four-and-twenty
hours for the necessary preparations?”&mdash;“Our preparations
can be made in an hour,” said Leonard obstinately:
then, reseating himself, he drank off another
tumblerful of wine. “Listen to me. What preparations
have you to make, save to possess yourself
of all the money, plate, jewels, and other valuables
you can lay your hands upon?”&mdash;Ellen stared
at her lover with the fixed gaze of mingled astonishment
and horror.&mdash;“Well, what is the matter
with you?” he demanded.&mdash;“Leonard, you are not
in earnest?” she said at length: “you would not
have me rob my husband of his plate?”&mdash;“Certainly,”
replied the ruffian: “and of his watch, and everything
of value that is portable in the house. We
must not go away empty-handed, I can tell you.”&mdash;“Is
it possible that you would counsel me to do
this?” asked Ellen, speaking in a low and agitated
voice. “Leonard, I have never hesitated to supply
you with money, because that is an article which I
believe to exist in common between a husband and
wife. Moreover, the household has suffered in no
way by the appropriation of those sums to your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
wants. But if you mean me to plunder my husband
of his plate&mdash;his watch&mdash;and other things which
are beyond all question his own exclusively, I declare
once for all that I will not be a party to such
a deed. It is sufficient,” she added, tears now bursting
from her eyes, “that I am what I am, without
leaving behind me the reputation of a thief.”&mdash;Leonard
ground his teeth with rage: and again he had
recourse to the wine-bottle.&mdash;“Pray recall the
words that you have uttered,” exclaimed Ellen:
“tell me that you were joking, or that you only
made the proposal in order to try me!”&mdash;“I never
was more serious in my life,” said Leonard, brutally.&mdash;“Oh!
what do I hear?” cried the wretched
woman, wringing her hands.&mdash;“Enough of this!”
ejaculated the ruffian, starting from his seat. “Do
you mean to accompany me, or do you not?”&mdash;“Yes,
yes; I have pledged myself to <em>that</em>!”&mdash;“And are
we to go empty-handed?”&mdash;“I have sixty or seventy
pounds in money, and my jewels are worth as much
more.”&mdash;“And the plate?” demanded Leonard.&mdash;“Is
always kept in a box beneath Mr. Gamble’s
bed; and therefore you see how impossible it is to
obtain it, even if I were disposed to plunder him of
property which has been in his family for so many,
many years.”</p>

<p>Leonard reseated himself&mdash;poured out more wine&mdash;drank
it&mdash;and then fell into a deep meditation.
Ellen watched his countenance, flattering herself
that the reason she had alleged for forbearance in
respect to the plate would prove efficient. But she
had only confirmed the ruffian in his resolution to
possess it; inasmuch as she had committed herself
in two ways. Firstly, she had told him where it
was; and secondly, by informing him that it had
been in the family for many years, she had naturally
left on his mind the impression that it was of considerable
value&mdash;for heir-looms of that species are
usually costly. What, then, was Leonard Mitchell
really thinking of&mdash;thinking of, too, under the influence
of the deep potations which he had imbibed?
He was revolving a hellish project in his
mind. If he endeavoured to possess himself of the
plate contrary to the assent of Ellen, a disturbance
would ensue in the house, and his arrest as a deserter
might follow upon the discovery of his presence
there. To depart without the plate was not
at all suitable to his purposes: for if he repaired
to a foreign country, it would not be to toil for a
livelihood. How, then, was he to secure the coveted
property, and carry it away without the chance of
noise or detection? Only if Ellen were removed
from his path! Yes&mdash;<em>this</em> was the project now
revolved in the mind of the lost, depraved young
man; and, having again fortified himself with
liquor, he determined to put his diabolical scheme
into execution. Suddenly rising from his seat, he
approached Ellen, and, taking her hand, said, “Forgive
me, dearest, for what I dared to utter just
now. We will delay our departure until to-morrow
night; and then you shall take with you just so
much as you choose to select, and nothing more.”&mdash;“I
freely pardon you, Leonard,” she replied; and
yet, as he bent over her, there was a wild gleaming
in his eye and a peculiarity of expression in his
countenance which caused vague apprehensions to
sweep across her mind. “But how strangely you
regard me, Leonard,” she said: “is anything the
matter with you?”&mdash;“Nothing, nothing, dearest,”
he responded, throwing his arms round her neck
and pressing her head as if in the fervour of affection
against his bosom. All her alarms were immediately
dissipated; and, thrown completely off her
guard, she returned the embrace, abandoning herself
entirely to him. At that instant his right hand was
withdrawn; and, as he uttered some words of endearment,
he possessed himself of the carving knife,
unperceived by her.&mdash;“Let us now retire to rest,
Leonard,” she murmured, as her face lay buried on
his chest: “It is growing late&mdash;&mdash;Oh! heavens&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And farther utterance was suddenly stopped;
for, like a flash of lightning, the sharp blade, gleaming
in the rays of the lamp, was drawn across her
throat&mdash;the murderer turning her head and throwing
it back at the same moment in order to aid his
fell design. Death was almost instantaneous; and
the miscreant gently lowered the body upon the
floor. For nearly half a minute did he stand gazing
upon that corpse&mdash;unable to believe that it was
really what it seemed to be, and that he had perpetrated
the deed. Then, as the awful conviction
stared him fully in the face, and the entire sense of
his enormity seized upon his soul, he would have
given worlds, had he possessed them, to undo what
was there done! But it was too late&mdash;oh! too late;
and he must save himself&mdash;he must escape! A
bumper of brandy gave him the courage of a brute:
and, taking the lamp in his hand, he crept cautiously
to Mr. Gamble’s bed-room. The door was
unlocked, and the old man slept profoundly. Beneath
the bed was the plate-chest: but it was
securely fastened with a padlock. Leonard raised
the chest, and, placing it on his shoulder, was about
to quit the room, when he espied upon a chair the
clothes which Mr. Gamble had put off when retiring
to rest. These garments the murderer likewise
self-appropriated, as well as a hat, which was standing
on a chest of drawers; and he noiselessly retraced
his way to the chamber where the corpse
lay. Turning his back towards that appalling spectacle,
he proceeded to dress himself in Mr. Gamble’s
apparel, which fitted him quite well enough for
his purpose, and was at all events a safer attire
than his uniform. He next proceeded to break
open the plate-chest&mdash;a task speedily effected
by means of the same knife that had accomplished
the murder. The contents of the
chest, when rapidly scanned by his eager eyes,
were evidently of great value; and he hastened
to pack them up in towels, and lastly in brown
paper. He then rifled the jewel-box of his
murdered paramour; and, in addition to the costly
articles which he found there, were the seventy
pounds that the unfortunate woman had alluded
to but a few minutes before she had ceased to
exist. Leonard was satisfied with the booty thus
acquired; and he was moreover in haste to depart.
Having secured the money and jewels about his
person, he took the parcel containing the plate
under his arm, and stole cautiously down the
stairs. All was silent throughout the house:
several times did he pause to listen&mdash;but not a
sound was heard;&mdash;and he gained the street without
interruption. When, however, he was in the
open air, he knew not whither to go&mdash;what plan to
adopt,&mdash;whether to seek concealment in London
until the coming storm should have blown over, or
to make every effort to get out of England. The
latter plan appeared to be the more advisable; and
he accordingly pushed on towards the Dover road.</p>

<p>It was shortly after sun-rise that Mr. Gamble,
awaking from a sound sleep, beheld a deep stain on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
the ceiling of his chamber; and, with eyes rivetted
upon it, he lay reflecting what it could possibly be.
The old man was half childish; and the strangest
conjectures passed through his mind. At length he
grew frightened: an unknown terror stole gradually
upon him&mdash;and he rang his bell violently. In a few
minutes the two female domestics entered the room,
having hastily huddled on some clothing; and they
found their master gazing intently up at the ceiling,
with a wild vacancy in the eyes. Their own looks
instantly took the same direction; and one of them
suddenly exclaimed, with shuddering horror, “It is
blood!” They then hurried up-stairs; and a frightful
spectacle met their view. Their mistress lay
upon the floor, with her throat cut from ear to ear;
and the carpet was completely saturated with her
blood. Screams and shrieks burst from the lips of
the horror-stricken women; and rushing down
stairs, they rashly communicated to Mr. Gamble,
without any previous warning or preparation, the
dreadful tragedy which had been enacted. The
flickering, decaying lamp of the old man’s intellect
suddenly burnt up vividly for a few moments: the
full powers of reason returned;&mdash;he comprehended
the appalling news which were thus unguardedly
made known to him; and with a horrible lamentation
he sprang from his bed. With incredible speed
did he ascend to his wife’s chamber; and when the
awful spectacle met his eyes, he threw up his arms
in despair, gave vent to a piteous cry, and sank
down on the blood-stained corpse. Meantime one
of the servants had hastened next door to alarm Mr.
Pomfret; and when that gentleman, accompanied
by two or three of his own domestics, appeared on
the scene of murder, assistance was immediately
offered to Mr. Gamble. But all endeavours to recover
him were ineffectual: the shock he had received
was a death-blow&mdash;and life was extinct!</p>

<p>A few questions hastily put to the old man’s
servants elicited many facts dreadful for Mr. Pomfret
to hear. He now learnt enough to convince
him that his daughter had long maintained an illicit
connexion with a handsome young dragoon&mdash;that
her lover had been admitted the night before the
one of the murder into the house&mdash;and that he must
have been the author of the dreadful deed. Farther
investigation corroborated this belief: the uniform
was found, and a suit of Mr. Gamble’s apparel had
disappeared;&mdash;the plate, jewels, and money were
likewise gone. The distracted father, having heard
a long time previously that Leonard Mitchell had
enlisted in a dragoon regiment, immediately suspected
that he must be the criminal; and this idea
was confirmed by the discovery of some letters in
Ellen’s desk. Information of the murder and robbery
was accordingly given to the proper authorities;
and Mr. Pomfret, crushed to the very dust by
the weight of misfortune, crept back to his own
cheerless dwelling&mdash;there to meditate upon the
closing scene of the tragedy in which his own conduct
had originally made his poor daughter the
heroine. Bitterness was in the wretched man’s soul&mdash;horror
in his eyes&mdash;spasmodic shuddering in all
his limbs; and, when he contemplated his child’s
horrible end and his own ruined fortunes, he felt
indeed that he had nothing left worth living for.
The cup of his adversity was not, however, quite
full yet: but in a few hours it was overflowing&mdash;for
his head clerk arrived in a cab, and, rushing into the
parlour without ceremony, announced to him that
the officers of justice were in search of him, a true
bill of indictment having been found against him
for certain frauds in his commercial transactions.
“Thank you&mdash;thank you, for coming to give me
this timely warning,” said Mr. Pomfret, pressing his
clerk’s hand with painful violence: “I will depart
immediately;”&mdash;and he staggered from the room.
The clerk waited five minutes, and began to grow
impatient: ten minutes elapsed and still his master
did not reappear. The man rose and rang the bell
furiously to summon one of the domestics; but at
the same instant the constables entered the house.
These officials, having learnt from the servant who
admitted them, that Mr. Pomfret was at home, proceeded
to search the dwelling; and the clerk, now
entertaining the worst fears, accompanied them to
the ruined merchant’s bed-chamber. There these
fears met with immediate confirmation: Mr. Pomfret
had put a period to his existence&mdash;he had hanged
himself to a strong nail in his sleeping apartment!
The body was instantly cut down, and medical assistance
promptly obtained: but the wretched suicide
was no more.</p>

<p>In the evening of that same day a man was
arrested under suspicious circumstances at Dover.
The news of the awful occurrences in Stamford
Street had not reached that town at the time&mdash;for
there was neither railway nor electric telegraph
between London and the Kentish coast in those
days: but the individual alluded to, had presented
a quantity of plate at a pawnbroker’s shop, and,
not being able to give a satisfactory account of how
it came into his possession, was detained until a
constable arrived to take him into custody. On the
ensuing morning the tidings of the murder in London
reached Dover; and the particulars given by
the newspapers of the preceding evening were
ample enough to identify the person under arrest
with the Leonard Mitchell who was accused of
desertion, murder, and robbery. He was accordingly
sent under a strong escort to the metropolis,
where, on his arrival, he was immediately lodged in
Newgate. In due course his trial came on: he
was found guilty upon evidence the most conclusive:&mdash;and,
upon being called upon to allege anything
wherefore sentence of death should not be
passed, he addressed the Judge in the following
manner:&mdash;“I acknowledge, my lord, that I am
guilty of the dreadful crime imputed to me; and
although it be too late&mdash;far too late to express
contrition now, I nevertheless declare that I am
deeply, deeply penitent. My lord, lost&mdash;degraded&mdash;criminal&mdash;and
condemned, as I stand here in your
presence, I was once as sincerely attached to virtue
as any man or woman who now hears me. Even
when adversity entered the paternal dwelling,
ravaging it with the desolating fury of an army, I
yielded to no evil temptation: neither did my confidence
in the justice, the goodness, and the wisdom
of heaven abate. I enlisted, my lord, in order to
obtain an honest livelihood, and to stifle in the
bustle of a new state of existence the painful reminiscences
of blighted hopes and crushed affections.
The officers who have appeared before your lordship
this day, have all admitted, in reply to the
question I put to them, that up to the time when I
was sentenced to three hundred lashes, I had never
even received a reprimand nor had been once reported
for the slightest irregularity. But from the moment
that the first blow of the torturing and degrading weapon
fell upon my back, my existence assumed a new
phase&mdash;my soul underwent a sudden and immediate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
change. With each drop of blood that oozed from my
lacerated back, ebbed away some sentiment of rectitude&mdash;some
principle of virtue. My lord, it was the
lash that drove me to drinking&mdash;that made me reckless
of all consequences&mdash;that made me a liar and a
voluptuary, a mean fellow and a paltry rascal&mdash;and
that hardened my heart so as to render it inaccessible
to every feeling of honour, mercy, or remorse.
It was the lash, then, that has made me a murderer;
and I might almost claim to be pitied, rather than
to be looked upon with loathing. A cruel law
taught me to be cruel: a merciless and barbarian
punishment prepared me to become a ruthless and
ferocious assassin. And now, my lord, I am about
to reveal a fact which has long ago been suspected,
and which, situated as I unhappily am, need not
exist in doubt or uncertainty any more. My life
must be forfeited for the crime which has been
proved against me this day; and it will unburthen
my soul of a heavy secret to confess another crime,
which I perpetrated upwards of a year ago. Your
lordship doubtless remembers that a young nobleman&mdash;an
officer in the regiment to which I belonged&mdash;was
shot at a review in Hyde Park. My lord, I
was the assassin: the man accused me wrongfully&mdash;persecuted
me unrelentingly&mdash;and lied most foully
against me,&mdash;and I was avenged.”</p>

<div id="i_305" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_305.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As Leonard uttered these last words in a firm
tone and with marked emphasis, a thrill of horror
passed through the crowded court; and the dead
silence which had been observed while he was speaking,
was succeeded by a subdued murmuring as of
many voices commenting on what he had said.
Erect, and with an evident determination to meet
his doom courageously, the unhappy young man
stood in the dock&mdash;his eye quailing not, his limbs
trembling not; and, heinous as his offences were,
he was not altogether without commiseration on
the part of many present. The judge put on the
black cap; and the sentence of death&mdash;that barbarian
sentence&mdash;was pronounced in due form, the
culprit receiving an intimation that he need entertain
no hope of mercy. The hint was unnecessary:
he had made up his mind to suffer;&mdash;and as firmly
as he walked out of the dock back into the prison,
so resolutely did he step from that same prison ten
days afterwards on to the scaffold erected at the
debtors’ door. A tremendous crowd was assembled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
to witness the execution; and the unhappy criminal
maintained his courage to the last.</p>

<p>From that time have the three houses in Stamford
Street been shut up: from that period have they
been suffered to fall into decay. In the first, old
Mr. Mitchell expired suddenly: in the second, Mr.
Pomfret hung himself;&mdash;and in the third, Ellen was
brutally murdered. The hand of Fate had marked
those three tenements to be the scenes of horror
and of crime: and a superstitious feeling on the
part of certain credulous and weak-minded neighbours
soon engendered the report that they were
haunted. It was said that the ghost of the young
lady had been seen walking in her shroud, in the
yard behind the house where she was murdered;
and rumour added that on the anniversary night of
the dread crime which had hurried her to a premature
grave, she was wont to wander about the premises,
uttering hollow and sepulchral moans. Such
reports as those lose nothing by repetition during
the lapse of years, especially while the buildings
which were the scenes of the crimes engendering
the superstition, continue to exist; and therefore is
it that even at the present day the evil reputation
of the <span class="smcap">HAUNTED HOUSES</span> remains unimpaired in
Stamford Street and its neighbourhood.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXIX">CHAPTER CLXXIX.<br />

<span class="medium">THE GHOST.&mdash;AGNES AND MRS. MORTIMER.</span></h2>

<p>The preceding episode has run to a considerable
length; but we hope and believe that our readers
will experience no difficulty in resuming the thread
of the general narrative.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the leading incidents
of the story just placed on record were related to
Mrs. Mortimer by Jack Rily, by way of passing the
few hours during which they had agreed to remain
with Vitriol Bob, who, bound hand and foot, was
seated helplessly in a chair.</p>

<p>“Yes,” observed Jack Rily, when he had brought
his history to a conclusion, “they do say that the
young woman walks at times&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak in such a solemn tone,” interrupted
Mrs. Mortimer, casting a shuddering glance
around: “you almost make me think that you
yourself believe in the possibility of the spectral
visitation.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I don’t know how it is.” returned the
Doctor, feeling a certain superstitious influence
growing upon him, and which he vainly endeavoured
to shake off,&mdash;“but I certainly never before had
such sensations as I experience now. Upon my
soul;” he cried, striking the table violently with
his clenched fist, “I am a prey to vague and undefined
alarms to night:&mdash;but I will subdue them!”</p>

<p>“And are you sure that this is the house where
the young lady was murdered?” asked Mrs. Mortimer,
after a brief pause.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt about <em>that</em>!” responded Jack
Rily. “Vitriol Bob there can tell you that the
floor of the chamber where the deed took place is
blackened with accumulated dust, yet in the middle
there is a deeper stain; and on the ceiling of the
room beneath, it is easy to descry the same sinister
traces, even amidst dirt and cobwebs.”</p>

<p>“Then, as you said just now,” remarked Mrs.
Mortimer, drawing her shawl over her shoulders&mdash;for
she experienced the chill of superstitious terror
gaining upon her,&mdash;“as you said just now, <em>this</em> is
the second murder that has been committed within
these walls!”</p>

<p>Scarcely had Mrs. Mortimer ceased speaking
when the bell of the neighbouring church proclaimed
the hour of <em>one</em>.</p>

<p>“Now is the time for the ghost,” said Vitriol
Bob, with a low but ferocious chuckle; for he experienced
a malignant pleasure in observing that
superstitious fears were gaining on the formidable
Rily and the hideous old woman. “You don’t like
the near neighbourhood of the stiff ’un, I’m a-thinking!
Well&mdash;I’ll lay you a wager, Jack, that
I’ll go and shake the old feller by the hand quite
in a friendly way&mdash;if you will but take off these
cussed cords. There’s no ill feelin’ betwixt us
now.”</p>

<p>“I would much rather leave you where you are,
and send Polly Calvert to release you,” replied
the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” hastily exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer,
“let him be where he is. But surely we may go
now, Mr. Rily? It is getting on for two&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It has only just this minit struck one!” cried
Vitriol Bob, with a malignant leer from his dark,
reptile-like eyes, which seemed to shine with a
glare of their own, independent of and brighter
than the dim light of the miserable candle. “Besides,”
he added, now purposely rendering his
voice as solemn and ominous in its tone as possible,
“’tis just the time for the ghost of the young
gal&mdash;or rayther, the young o’oman to walk; and
I should be wexed indeed if you didn’t stay to have
a look at her. I’ve seen her more than once&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s an infernal falsehood, Bob!” exclaimed
Jack Rily, starting from his seat on the barrel, and
vainly endeavouring to subdue the nervous excitement
that had gained so rapidly upon him.</p>

<p>“It’s true&mdash;true as you’re there!” cried the murderer,
who felt a ferocious joy at thus inspiring
terror in the mind of the strong and hardened ruffian
who had conquered him. “And I’ll tell you
somethink more too,” continued Vitriol Bob: “you
said just now&mdash;and you said truly also&mdash;that on the
anniwersary of the murder the young lady wanders
about the place, uttering holler moans. Well&mdash;this
is the night, then, that she was murdered just
twenty years ago;&mdash;and the clock has struck <em>one</em>!”</p>

<p>The effect which these words produced upon Jack
Rily and Mrs. Mortimer was as rapid as it was
extraordinary. Although they were both of a nature
peculiarly inaccessible to superstitious terrors on
common occasions, and under any other circumstances
would have laughed at the idea of spectral
visitations and ghostly wanderings,&mdash;yet now they
vainly struggled against the powerful influence of
increasing terror; and, although in their hearts,
they more than half suspected that Vitriol Bob had
spoken only to aggravate their alarms, yet they
could not shake off the awe and consternation that
seized upon their souls. In respect to Jack Rily,
it was one of those periods of evanescent weakness
which the most brutal and remorseless ruffians are
known periodically to experience;&mdash;but, with regard
to Mrs. Mortimer, it was the singularity of her present
position&mdash;the consciousness that she was in a
lonely place with two men of desperate character&mdash;the
terrible remembrance that the murdered corse
of her husband lay in the adjoining room&mdash;the impression
made upon her mind by the appalling history
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
of crime which had been to elaborately detailed
to her&mdash;the thought that the very floors and
the ceilings of the uppermost chambers in that
house, bore testimony to the tale of blood&mdash;and the
idea that the ghost of the assassinated lady was
wont to wander in the depth of the night and on
the scene of the crime,&mdash;it was all this that struck
Mrs. Mortimer with awe and consternation, rendering
her incapable of serious reflection, and levelling
her strong mind as it were beneath the influence of
superstitious terrors.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what the devil is the matter with you
both?” demanded Vitriol Bob, after a pause.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Jack Rily, reseating
himself, and grasping the brandy-bottle with
a trembling hand.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;you and the old lady looked at each other
as if you already heard the light step and the rustling
shroud of the apparition,” said the murderer.</p>

<p>“Hark! what was that?” ejaculated the Doctor,
once more starting to his feet.</p>

<p>“It certainly was a noise somewhere,” observed
Mrs. Mortimer, trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the old man in the back-kitchen has
got up and is groping his way about,” said Vitriol
Bob, speaking with an affectation of terror which
was so natural that it cruelly enhanced the superstitious
alarms experienced by his companions.</p>

<p>“This is intolerable!” exclaimed Rily, looking
in a ghastly manner towards the door, as if he
more than half expected to behold it suddenly
thrown open, and some hideous form appear on the
threshold. “I can’t make out what it is that has
come over me to-night! ’Tis like a warning&mdash;and
yet I never believed in ghosts until now.”</p>

<p>“Nor I&mdash;nor I!” murmured Mrs. Mortimer.
“But to-night&mdash;I feel also as if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hark!” suddenly cried Vitriol Bob: “there is
a noise again!”</p>

<p>“It must be the old man!” ejaculated the Doctor.
“Are you sure that you did for him thoroughly?”</p>

<p>“If anythink like him meets your eyes, Jack, it
must be his ghost, I can assure you,” was the solemn
answer&mdash;although Vitriol Bob himself partook
not in the slightest degree of the superstitious terrors
that had grown upon his companions, but was
on the contrary inwardly chuckling with malignant
joy at their awe-struck state of mind.</p>

<p>“There! did you hear it?” demanded Mrs. Mortimer,
in a hasty and excited tone. “I am sure it
was a noise this time: there could be no mistake
about it!”</p>

<p>And she endeavoured to rise from her chair;&mdash;but
terror kept her motionless&mdash;paralysing every
limb, though not placing a seal upon her lips.</p>

<p>“Something dreadful is to happen to-night&mdash;I
know it&mdash;I feel it!” said Jack Rily, in a tone which
indicated remorse for a long career of crime and
turpitude. “By God! ’tis the back-door of the
house that is opening&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then this is serious indeed!” interrupted Vitriol
Bob, now alarmed in his turn&mdash;but rather on account
of constables than spectres. “Unloose me&mdash;let
us fight&mdash;resist&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence!” muttered Jack Rily, in a low but
imperious tone.</p>

<p>There was a pause of nearly a minute, during
which the three inmates of the kitchen held their
breath to listen, in painful suspense.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rattling of the crazy bannisters
outside fell upon their ears; and Jack Rily, worked
up to a pitch of desperation, seized the candle, saying
in a hoarse and dogged tone, “By hell! I will
face it, whatever it may be!”</p>

<p>With these words he tore open the kitchen-door;&mdash;and,
behold! before him stood a female form&mdash;clothed
in white&mdash;with a countenance pale as death&mdash;her
hair flowing wildly and dishevelled over her
shoulders&mdash;and with eyes fixed in unnatural brilliancy
upon him.</p>

<p>The ruffian was for a few moments paralyzed&mdash;stupified
with horror: then, unable any longer to
endure the spectacle which his fears converted into
a corpse wrapped in a winding-sheet, he exclaimed,
“The ghost! the ghost!”&mdash;and dropped the candle
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Total darkness immediately ensued.</p>

<p>At the same instant a piercing scream echoed
through the house; and Mrs. Mortimer, now recovering
all her presence of mind, started to her
feet, crying, “That is no apparition&mdash;save of flesh
and blood! Haste, Jack Rily&mdash;procure a light!
Where are you, man? Let us see who it is!”</p>

<p>“Here I am,” returned the Doctor, likewise regaining
his self-possession. “Bob, where are the
lucifers?”</p>

<p>“In my right-hand pocket,” growled the murderer,
who, in the excitement of the past scene, and
in the tremendous but ineffectual exertions which
he had made to release himself from his bonds the
moment the light was extinguished, had fallen from
his seat and rolled upon the floor.</p>

<p>Nearly half a minute now elapsed ere the candle
was found and lighted again; and then Jack Rily,
closely followed by Mrs. Mortimer, hastened into
the passage, where they beheld the form of a young
female stretched senseless at the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>The old woman stooped down to raise her: but
scarcely had she caught a glimpse of the pale countenance,
on which the finger of death seemed to have
been placed, when, starting with surprise and joy,
she exclaimed, “’Tis Agnes Vernon, as I am a living
being!”</p>

<p>“Agnes Vernon&mdash;who is she? do you know her?”
demanded the Doctor, holding forward the light.
“By Jove! she is a sweet creature, whoever she is!
That’s right&mdash;raise her gently. But is she dead,
poor thing?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no: her heart beats&mdash;and her lips already
begin to move,” responded Mrs. Mortimer hastily, as
she held the still senseless maiden in her arms.
“Well&mdash;this is a lucky chance that has thrown her
in our way&mdash;and there’s money to be made out of
it.”</p>

<p>“So much the better? Shall I get a little water?”
asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and use despatch,” returned Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>Jack Rily entered the kitchen, and filled a glass
with water.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” demanded Vitriol Bob, whom the
Doctor had previously restored to his position in the
chair.</p>

<p>“A young lady that Mrs. Mortimer happens to
know,” was the reply. “There is no danger from
other visitors, according to all appearances: so keep
quiet, and don’t alarm yourself.”</p>

<p>The Doctor hastened back into the passage, where
Mrs. Mortimer was seated on the last step of the
staircase, supporting Agnes in her arms.</p>

<p>“Now, will you follow my advice, Mr. Rily?” she
demanded in a rapid tone, as she sprinkled the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
water upon the pallid countenance of the young
lady.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;if it seems feasible,” was the immediate
answer. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“That we do not keep this timid thing a moment
longer in the house than is absolutely necessary,”
continued Mrs. Mortimer. “For our own sakes we
must guard against her beholding the interior of
that place;” and, as she uttered these words in a
low tone, she nodded significantly towards the door
of the back kitchen where the corpse of Torrens
had been deposited.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: I understand,” said Jack Rily: “it
might be thought that we were accomplices in the
murder. In the same way it would do no good to
let her see Vitriol Bob bound neck and crop in the
front kitchen.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I was about to suggest,” observed
Mrs. Mortimer. “We must get her out of
the house as soon as possible, and into a cab&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then don’t use any more means to recover her,”
interrupted Jack Rily, snatching the glass of water
from the old woman’s hand. “Let her remain for
a short time longer in that trance: it will not kill
her, depend upon it&mdash;and you have the advantage
of possessing an &AElig;sculapius in me.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose, then?” demanded Mrs.
Mortimer, casting an anxious glance upon the countenance
of the still senseless girl.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, I tell you,” repeated Jack
Rily: “I will guarantee that she shall recover. But
let us be off at once. I will take her in my arms
and carry her into Bennett Street; the neighbourhood
is all quiet and deserted at this hour;&mdash;and you
shall order round a cab from the stand in the road
There are always two or three in attendance throughout
the night.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer. “We will
be off at once.”</p>

<p>“This instant,” said Jack Rily, as he gently raised
the motionless, senseless form in his powerful arms,
while Mrs. Mortimer took off her shawl and wrapped
it hastily over the head and shoulders of Agnes.</p>

<p>The Doctor gave a hurried intimation to Vitriol
Bob that Molly Calvert should be sent to him as
speedily as possible; and he then stole out of the
house, Mrs. Mortimer having previously ascertained
that the coast was perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Everything was effected as Jack Rily had proposed.
He gained Bennett Street, with his lovely
burthen in his arms; and there he waited in the
deep darkness afforded by a large gateway, until
Mrs. Mortimer came round with the cab. The
maiden was placed in the vehicle, which the old
woman entered in order to take charge of her; and
Jack Rily, after having made an appointment with
his accomplice for the next evening, bade her a temporary
farewell.</p>

<p>The cab drove away towards Park Square; and
the Doctor, on his side, hurried off to the lodgings
of Pig-faced Moll.</p>

<p>But the thread of our narrative now lies with
Mrs. Mortimer and the beauteous Agnes Vernon.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the cab moved away from the vicinity
of the haunted houses, when Agnes began rapidly
to recover; and, on opening her eyes, she became
aware that she was reclining in the arms of a
female, and that they were being borne speedily
along in a vehicle. For an instant it struck her
that she must be with her mother: but in the next
moment the horrors of the night crowded rapidly
into her memory,&mdash;and, starting up, she demanded
in a hurried, anxious manner, “Where am I? and
who are you?”</p>

<p>Scarcely were the questions put when the young
maiden was enabled, by the silver moon-light, to
catch a glimpse of the countenance of her companion;
and she instantly recognised Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>Her first emotions were of joy and gratitude;&mdash;for
she was delighted to find herself in the care of a
female&mdash;especially one of whom she knew something:
and, taking the old woman’s hand, she said,
“Madam, I know not how to thank you&mdash;and am
scarcely aware of what I have to thank you for.
But&mdash;if my impressions be correct&mdash;you must have
rescued me from something very terrible! Yes&mdash;I
recollect now&mdash;that door opening&mdash;a light appearing&mdash;and
then that hideous, horrible face&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And, with a visible shudder, the maiden threw
herself back in the vehicle, pressing her hands to
her throbbing brows in order to collect her still
disjointed and somewhat confused reminiscences.</p>

<p>“You are labouring under dreadful recollections
my dear child,” said Mrs. Mortimer, in a soothing
tone. “Know you not&mdash;can you not suspect that
you were in the power of a ruffian when I fortunately
encountered you?”</p>

<p>“But where&mdash;where?” demanded Agnes, impatiently,
as her settling ideas seemed to coincide
with that belief.</p>

<p>“I should rather ask you, my sweet maiden,”
said Mrs. Mortimer, “how you came to be in Stamford
Street this night.”</p>

<p>“My mother took me thither&mdash;yes&mdash;I recollect
it all now!” exclaimed Agnes. “She left me at
the house of some dear friends&mdash;and I was ungrateful
enough to entertain the most injurious suspicions
respecting them,&mdash;yes&mdash;and relative to my
own dear mother also.”</p>

<p>“Your mother?” repeated Mrs. Mortimer, in
astonishment. “I thought you had never known
her&mdash;or that she had died when you were in your
infancy.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no&mdash;thank God! my mother is alive&mdash;and
I know her now!” ejaculated Agnes, with all the
enthusiasm of a strongly reviving affection&mdash;a
powerfully resuscitating devotion for the parent
whom she had so lately discovered.</p>

<p>“But where is your mother now?” enquired Mrs.
Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Ah! that I know not!” replied Agnes. “And
this reminds me,” she exclaimed after a few moments’
pause, “that you must take me back to the
good kind ladies in Stamford Street, that I may
remain there until my mother shall come to fetch
me away to the new home which she has promised
to prepare for me.”</p>

<p>“Who are those good ladies?” asked Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Their name is Theobald, and they live in Stamford
Street,” responded the artless girl. “You
may know the house&mdash;or at least the driver of the
vehicle can find it out, when I describe it as being
situated fourth from the corner of the Blackfriars’
Road, and next to three deserted&mdash;dilapidated&mdash;sinister-looking
houses&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! then you must have found your way from
the dwelling of your friends into one of those
ruined places,” thought Mrs. Mortimer. “But
I am really at a loss, my dear young lady, to comprehend
all you tell me,” she said aloud.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p>“Before I give you the necessary explanations to
enable you to understand it all,” said Agnes, “will
you inform me which road the vehicle is pursuing?”</p>

<p>“I am taking you to a place of safety, my dear
girl,” responded Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“A place of safety!” repeated Agnes, her countenance
assuming an expression of deep anxiety:
“am I, then, in any danger? and in what does the
peril consist?”</p>

<p>“I know not, my love,” answered the old woman,
speaking in the kindest tone of voice. “I only
judge by the condition in which I found you&mdash;the
circumstances which threw us this night together&mdash;and
the observations which have fallen from your
lips, that you were indeed in a state of extreme
danger.”</p>

<p>“Just heaven!” ejaculated Agnes. “But what
observations did I make&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That you had entertained suspicions relative to
the friends to whose care your mother had consigned
you,” said Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and I told you truly,” resumed the ingenuous
maiden. “I know not how it was&mdash;I cannot
account for it now&mdash;but when I found myself alone
in a strange house, terrible though undefined fears
took possession of my soul&mdash;and I resolved to escape.
I succeeded in getting as far as the next
house, which I entered: but scarcely had I crossed
the threshold of the back door, when a light suddenly
appeared and a countenance was revealed to
my affrighted gaze&mdash;a countenance so dreadful to
look upon that I tremble now as I think of it.
Then, so far as I can recollect, I heard a voice
thundering something loud but unintelligible in
my ears: I screamed&mdash;and fainted. When I came
to my senses, I was in your arms and in this vehicle.”</p>

<p>“I can throw some light upon the matter,” said
Mrs. Mortimer, whose object was to keep the attention
of Agnes as much and as unremittingly engaged
as possible, so as to prevent her from growing
uneasy relative to the ultimate destination of the
cab: for should she become alarmed, she might
appeal to the driver for protection, and a disturbance
in the streets would prove inevitable. “You
must know,” continued Mrs. Mortimer, “that I
was returning home from a friend’s house in Stamford-street,
when I met a great, stout, horribly ugly
man carrying a female form in his arms. The
moon-light showed me his dreadful countenance&mdash;and
I instantly suspected that some foul play was
intended. I accordingly insisted that he should
stop&mdash;which he did with much reluctance, declaring
that you were his daughter, and that he was
taking you home, as you had fallen down in a fit.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then some mischief was really meditated
towards me!” exclaimed Agnes, clasping her
hands together in shuddering horror of the perils
through which she supposed herself to have passed.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;my dear child,” observed Mrs. Mortimer,
“you doubtless owe your life to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! madam,” interrupted Agnes, “how can I
ever sufficiently thank you for your goodness?”&mdash;then,
as a reminiscence struck to her artless mind
with the pang of a remorse, she exclaimed, as she
pressed the old woman’s wrinkled hands to her
lips, “It seems fated that I should suspect those
who are my best friends!”</p>

<p>“Do not think of that, my love,” said the wily
old creature, who easily conjectured what was
passing in that amiable maiden’s ingenuous soul.
“When you know me better, you will appreciate
my conduct towards you as it deserves. Doubtless
your father set you against me&mdash;and then that little
misunderstanding relative to the affair of Lord
William Trevelyan&mdash;&mdash;But enough of that for the
present! Let me conclude my little narrative relative
to yourself. Well, I was describing to you
how I compelled the man to stop; and I was about
to tell you that I was by no means satisfied with
the explanations he gave me. Indeed, I threatened
to summon the assistance of the police; and you
may be well assured that this menace suddenly became
a settled resolution, when, as the moonlight
fell upon the countenance of the fair creature whom
the man carried in his arms, I recognised yourself,
my sweet Agnes! You can conceive my astonishment,
perhaps&mdash;but you can form no idea of the
apprehension that seized on me; for I really love
you dearly, although I have seen so little of you.
The man was dreadfully alarmed when he perceived
that I knew you; and I had no difficulty in compelling
him to surrender you into my charge. He
then decamped; and I placed you in a cab which
happened to be passing at the time. You now
know all.”</p>

<p>“Ah! from what inconceivable perils have you
not saved me!” exclaimed Agnes, full of enthusiastic
and impassioned gratitude towards the
woman whom she looked upon as her deliverer. “My
dear mother will thank you warmly&mdash;earnestly&mdash;most
sincerely for this generous act on your part;
and I shall never, never forget the deep obligation
under which you have placed me.”</p>

<p>“Enough on that subject, my dear child,” said
Mrs. Mortimer. “You have spoken several times
of your mother&mdash;may I ask how you came to discover
her, or how she happened to have remained so
long unknown to you?”</p>

<p>“I am bewildered when I think of all that!” returned
Miss Vernon, in a mournful tone. “It was
last evening that she came to me&mdash;that she sought
me out in my retirement&mdash;that she announced herself
as my parent; and my heart’s feelings gave me
the assurance that she was indeed what she represented
herself to be. Then I agreed to accompany
her&mdash;for she told me that she was unhappy, and she
claimed my love and my duty as a daughter. Oh!
my dear madam, you can doubtless understand how
joyous&mdash;how delightful were my emotions on thus
encountering a mother whom I had never known
till then! I only thought of giving way to those delicious
feelings&mdash;until I found myself left in the charge
of strangers. Then it was that I grew afraid&mdash;that
vague and undefinable apprehensions took possession
of my soul&mdash;that I became suspicions of all
and everything&mdash;and that I fled! Foolish, mistaken
creature that I was! That one false step of
mine threw me into the hands of a monster, who
would perhaps have killed me had you not rescued
me from his power.”</p>

<p>Agnes paused, and arranged her hair&mdash;her dark,
luxuriant, glossy hair&mdash;floating so wildly and yet
so beauteously in its dishevelled state, over her
shoulders;&mdash;and now, as the tint of the rose had
returned to her cheeks, and her eyes had recovered
their witching softness of expression, she appeared
transcendantly lovely to the view of the old woman,
whom the moon-light enabled to survey the charming
creature seated opposite to her.</p>

<p>Suddenly the vehicle stopped;&mdash;and Agnes, hastily
looking from the windows, beheld a row of handsome
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
houses on one side, and an enclosure of verdant
shrubs and plants on the other.</p>

<p>“This is not Stamford Street, madam,” she said
to Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“No, my dear child,” was the almost whispered
reply: “but it is a place of safety to which I have
brought you. Do you imagine that I, who have
saved your life this night, could intend you any
harm? Wherefore be thus ever suspicious respecting
your best friends?”</p>

<p>These words not only reassured Agnes, but made
her blush at what she deemed to be her ingratitude
towards her deliverer;&mdash;and, pressing the old woman’s
hand fervently, she murmured, “Forgive me,
I implore you!”</p>

<p>“Think no more of it, my love,” said Mrs. Mortimer,
as she alighted from the vehicle: then,
turning towards the maiden, she added, “Remain
in your place for a few minutes until I have aroused
the people of the house: the chill air of the early
morning will give you cold, lightly clad as you are.”</p>

<p>Agnes signified an assent; and the old woman
hastened up to the front door of the house at which
they had stopped. She knocked and rang: but
some time elapsed ere the summons was answered.
At length a domestic, who had huddled on some
clothing, made his appearance; and, to Mrs. Mortimer’s
query whether his master were at home, an
affirmative reply was given.</p>

<p>“Then hesitate not to arouse him&mdash;for I have
called upon a matter of great importance to his
lordship,” said the old woman.</p>

<p>“Certainly I will do so, madam,” returned the
domestic; “since you assure me that your business
is pressing. But will you not walk in and await his
lordship’s readiness to receive you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Mortimer; “and I have a
person with me who must accompany me. But
listen to something that I have to urge upon you.
You will conduct us both, as a matter of course,
into the same room: but when your master is
ready to receive me, take care that I obtain an interview
alone with him in the first instance. It is
of the highest consequence that these instructions
should be fully attended to.”</p>

<p>“You shall be obeyed, madam,” said the servant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer now fetched Agnes from the
vehicle, which she ordered to be kept waiting for
herself; and the two females were conducted by the
domestic into a handsome apartment, where, having
lighted the wax-candles, he left them.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXX">CHAPTER CLXXX.<br />

<span class="medium">AGNES AND TREVELYAN.</span></h2>

<p>In spite of her anxiety to place confidence in Mrs.
Mortimer&mdash;in spite of the deep obligation under
which she believed herself to be lying towards her,
Agnes could not subdue a partial feeling of uneasiness
when she found that she was in a strange
house, evidently the abode of a rich person.</p>

<p>She gazed round the walls covered with splendid
pictures&mdash;on the chandelier suspended to the ceiling&mdash;on
the elegant and costly furniture&mdash;the superb
mantel-ornaments&mdash;and down upon the luxurious
carpet, so thick that her tiny feet were almost imbedded
in it, as if she were walking in snow.</p>

<p>Whose dwelling could it be? Assuredly not Mrs.
Mortimer’s&mdash;for she was only treated as a visitress.
At length, after the lapse of a few minutes, the
young maiden ventured to ask, “Who are the
friends, madam, with whom you propose to leave
me?”</p>

<p>“Does not that very question, Agnes, imply a
suspicion injurious to me?” said Mrs. Mortimer,
evasively.</p>

<p>“Oh! no&mdash;no!” exclaimed Miss Vernon, in a melting
tone of the profoundest sincerity. “But may I
not ask so simple a question without being liable to
such a distressing imputation?”</p>

<p>“Can you not leave yourself in the hands of one
who has saved your life and who wishes you well?”
said the old woman, speaking in a voice of mingled
reproach and conciliation.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;certainly, madam,” was the immediate
answer: “but you yourself are not going to remain
here&mdash;inasmuch as you have ordered the cabriolet
to wait for you.”</p>

<p>“True, Agnes: because I have business of importance
to transact at an early hour this morning,
and at a considerable distance hence. Reassure
yourself, my darling girl,” continued the iniquitous
hag: “you will be delighted to meet the person
whom you will presently see. Indeed, it is only a
little surprise which I am preparing for you&mdash;and,
after all I have done for you, you surely will not
deny me the pleasure which I promise myself in
beholding the interview between yourself and the
owner of this splendid mansion.”</p>

<p>By degrees, as Mrs. Mortimer spoke, the countenance
of Agnes brightened up; for it struck the
young maiden that it was her mother whom she
was now to meet&mdash;and this idea grew into a positive
conviction by the time the old woman had uttered
the last words of her sentence. She was accordingly
about to express renewed gratitude for the
happy surprise thus reserved for her, when the
door opened and the domestic returned to the
apartment.</p>

<p>“Madam, will you follow me?” he said, addressing
himself to Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” observed the old woman, turning
towards Agnes and patting her face with a show of
affection, “you will remain here for a few minutes&mdash;a
very few minutes; and then,” she added, with a
sly smile, which meant as much as to intimate that
she read the hope entertained by Agnes, and should
speedily have the pleasure of gratifying it,&mdash;“and
then, my love, you will not scold me for having
kept you a little in suspense.”</p>

<p>Tears of gratitude trembled upon the long dark
lashes of the beauteous maiden, although her lips
were wreathed in smiles:&mdash;but when Nature melts
into April softness, ’tis with mingled rain and sunshine.</p>

<p>While Agnes remained alone in the handsome parlour,
cradling herself in the hope that the lapse of a
few minutes would see her embraced in the arms of her
mother, Mrs. Mortimer was conducted into another
apartment, where she found herself in the presence
of Lord William Trevelyan, who had dressed himself
with as much despatch as possible.</p>

<p>“Well, madam,” he said, in a hasty and even
anxious tone, “what has brought you hither at
this unseasonable hour?&mdash;whom have you with
you?&mdash;and wherefore this desire, as expressed to my
domestic, to see me alone in the first instance?”</p>

<p>“My lord, it is Agnes Vernon who has accompanied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
me, and who is in the room which I have
just left,” answered the old woman.</p>

<p>“I thought so&mdash;I was afraid that it was so,
when the servant gave me a description of her&mdash;a
very rapid and partial one, it is true, inasmuch as
he beheld her only for a few moments. But, great
heavens! madam,” continued the young nobleman,
speaking with singular and unusual vivacity, “what
means this strange proceeding?”</p>

<p>“That Agnes required an asylum, and I brought
her hither,” was the response.</p>

<p>“And do you for an instant imagine, madam,
that I am capable&mdash;that I would be guilty&mdash;that
I&mdash;&mdash;But, enough! I will say no more to you:
I see through your real character&mdash;and I loathe and
despise it! My God! to think that I should have
enlisted a common procuress in my service! Oh!
how can I ever look Agnes in the face?&mdash;how venture
to accost her, after having thus offered her the
most flagrant of insults? But, tell me, vile woman,”
he exclaimed, seizing Mrs. Mortimer forcibly by the
wrist, while his tone and manner alike indicated
the most painful excitement,&mdash;“tell me, I say, by
what detestable artifices you have induced that
innocent and unsuspecting maiden to accompany
you hither?”</p>

<p>“My lord, you will be ashamed of yourself for
this unworthy conduct towards me, when you come
to know all,&mdash;yes, ashamed and astonished at the
same time,” said Mrs. Mortimer, assuming an air
of offended dignity and wounded pride.</p>

<p>“How!&mdash;speak!” ejaculated Lord William,
dropping the woman’s arm and surveying her with
mingled surprise and repentance.</p>

<p>“I shall not waste precious time in entering into
details,” resumed Mrs. Mortimer. “Yesterday
morning I saw Agnes and induced her to peruse
your letter. She was offended, and tossed it indignantly
back to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried the nobleman, his countenance assuming
an expression of extreme vexation.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and here it is,” continued Mrs. Mortimer,
producing the epistle from her reticule, and laying
it upon the table.</p>

<p>“But she read it, you say?” exclaimed Lord
William.</p>

<p>“Every word,” was the response. “Nevertheless,
though softened and even pleased at first, she subsequently
thought better of it, and rejected the
communication in the manner I have described. I
was disheartened, and felt unwilling to return to
you with such unwelcome intelligence. An hour
ago I quitted the house of a friend in Stamford
Street; and in that same street the following adventure
occurred to me.”</p>

<p>The old woman then related precisely the same
anecdote which she had already told to Agnes,
relative to the pretended rescue of that young
lady from the power of a man who was bearing
her along insensible in his arms.</p>

<p>The young nobleman was astounded; and his
manner denoted incredulity.</p>

<p>“I perceive that your lordship puts no faith in
my narrative,” said Mrs. Mortimer, who conjectured
what was passing in his mind: “but the tale which
Agnes can tell you, will corroborate it. She herself
will inform you how she fell into the power of the
ruffian from whom it was subsequently my good
fortune to deliver her; and if you place confidence
in her words, you will perforce be led to accord the
same favour to mine?”</p>

<p>“And her tale&mdash;what is it?” demanded the nobleman,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Yesterday she discovered the mother whom she
had lost since her infancy,” answered Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Her mother!” exclaimed Trevelyan. “And
where is that mother? who is she? Tell me, that
I may hasten to her at as early an hour as possible,
and implore of her to accord me the hand of her
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Be not so hasty, my lord. I am totally unacquainted
with Agnes Vernon’s mother; and she
herself&mdash;poor artless girl! knows, I believe, but
little more. It is however certain that the young
lady was induced to accompany her newly-found
parent from the cottage&mdash;that she was consigned
to the care of two ladies named Theobald, and
dwelling in Stamford Street&mdash;that in the night
she became the prey to vague and unfounded terrors,
which induced her to attempt an escape from
the house&mdash;and that she fell into the hands of the
man from whom I rescued her.”</p>

<p>“And wherefore have you brought her hither?”
asked Lord William. “Why not have conducted
her back to the ladies to whose care her mother had
consigned her&mdash;or to the cottage where she has
dwelt so long?”</p>

<p>“I have put you in the position of one who may
perform a chivalrous action, and thereby win the
permanent esteem, gratitude, and love of this beautiful
creature whom you adore,” said Mrs. Mortimer;
“and now you appear inclined to load me with
reproaches. Yes&mdash;I perceive that reproaches <em>are</em>
trembling upon your lordship’s tongue;&mdash;and I who
have done all I could to serve you, shall experience
nought save ingratitude. Oh! short-sighted lover
that you are! Here is a young girl whom I pick
up as it were houseless and homeless&mdash;and I am
already half-way with her to your mansion, before I
even learn from her lips how she came in Stamford
Street at all, or that she has friends there. But
when I do glean those facts, I find that she has
escaped from the guardianship of those friends:
and could I suppose that they would be willing to
receive her again? Now, my lord, it is for you to
grant her an asylum&mdash;to treat her with all imaginable
delicacy and attention&mdash;and to leave me to
find out her mother, that you may restore the lost
daughter to the distracted parent. Doubtless the
Miss Theobalds will give me the desired information:
and then calculate the amount of gratitude
that will be due to you! In spite of her father&mdash;whoever
he may really be, and whatever opposition
he might raise&mdash;Agnes is yours; and you gain the
object of your heart’s dearest wishes.”</p>

<p>“And think you, woman,” exclaimed Lord William
Trevelyan, unable any longer to subdue his
resentment,&mdash;“think you that I will blast the fair
fame of this young lady by retaining her for even a
single hour beneath my roof?&mdash;think you that I
will obtain for her the inevitable reputation of
having been my mistress, previously to becoming
my wife? No&mdash;a thousand times no! And do
you imagine that I read not your heart aright? do
you suppose that I am your dupe? I tell you, vile
woman, that in bringing the innocent and artless
Agnes hither, you fancied you would be throwing in
my way a temptation which I could not resist,&mdash;a
temptation which would thaw all my virtuous principles
and honourable notions, and lead me to sacrifice
the purity of the confiding girl to my passion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Yes&mdash;such was your base calculation: or you would
at once and unhesitatingly have conducted her
either to the abode of her friends in Stamford
Street, or home to her own cottage! Ah! madam,
because I belong to the aristocracy, you imagine
that I must necessarily be as vile, depraved, and unprincipled
as ninety-nine out of every hundred individuals
who bear lordly titles. But you have deceived
yourself&mdash;grossly deceived yourself: and you
shall at once have the proof that you are so deceived!
Follow me.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Lord William advanced rapidly
towards the door, imperiously beckoning the vile
woman to accompany him.</p>

<p>“Whither are you going, my lord?” she demanded,
finding that she had indeed over-reached herself&mdash;that
the nobleman’s principles were more profoundly
rooted than she had imagined&mdash;and that all her
trouble was likely to go unrewarded.</p>

<p>“Follow me, I say: as you have done this amount
of mischief, you shall at least see it remedied to the
utmost of my power;”&mdash;and the nobleman burst
from the room, literally dragging the old woman
with him.</p>

<p>In less than a minute they entered the apartment
where Agnes was anxiously&mdash;oh! most anxiously
awaiting the presence of her mother;&mdash;and the
moment the door was opened, she darted forward
to precipitate herself into the arms of her parent.</p>

<p>But, recognising Lord William Trevelyan, she
stopped short with a cry of mingled disappointment,
surprise, and alarm; while an ashy pallor overspread
her countenance.</p>

<p>“Reassure yourself, Miss Vernon&mdash;I am your
friend, and a man of honour!” were the encouraging
words which Trevelyan hastened to address to her.</p>

<p>“And my mother?” said the young maiden, bending
a look of earnest appeal upon Mrs. Mortimer,
who however shrank back in confusion.</p>

<p>“Your mother is not here, Miss Vernon,” exclaimed
the nobleman: “neither does this woman
know where to find her. An act of the greatest
imprudence has been committed in bringing you
hither&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! what do I hear?” cried Agnes, clasping
her hands. “Is this your house, my lord? If so,”
she added, with dignity succeeding grief, “I am innocent
of any intention to intrude: indeed, your
lordship might full well conceive that I should not
have come hither of my own accord&mdash;oh! no&mdash;not
for worlds!”</p>

<p>And tears rolled down the cheeks of the gentle girl
for she felt humiliated in the presence of the very
man in whose eyes, if her young heart had a preference,
she would have fain appeared in another
light.</p>

<p>“Oh! Miss Vernon, it is you who do not understand
me!” ejaculated Lord William, advancing and taking
her hand. “If I spoke of the imprudence which
had been committed, it was on your account only!
For believe me when I declare that I should be
proud,&mdash;yes, and in the enjoyment of an elysian
happiness, could you enter this mansion to remain
here&mdash;to command here, with honour to yourself!
But I will not avail myself of this opportunity to
urge a suit that I have already ventured to prefer,
and in the prosecution of which I unfortunately
selected so improper an agent.”</p>

<p>As he uttered these words, he bent an indignant
look upon Mrs. Mortimer, who turned away petulantly
and made for the door.</p>

<p>“Stop, woman!” cried the young nobleman, hastening
to detain her: “I cannot yet part with you,
intolerable as your presence has become to me.
“Miss Vernon,” he continued, again turning toward
the maiden, whose sense of humiliation had
vanished, and who in her heart of hearts now rejoiced
in the conviction that Lord William Trevelyan
was indeed as noble in nature as he was in
name,&mdash;“I need scarcely observe that circumstances
compel me to procure for you an asylum for the
remainder of the night as speedily as possible. You
will permit me to conduct you to the abode of a
lady of my acquaintance,&mdash;a lady who will receive
you with open arms, and who will to-morrow&mdash;or
rather, in a few hours’ time&mdash;herself conduct you
to the abode of your friends in Stamford Street, or
to your own home near Streatham.”</p>

<p>With these words, the nobleman took the hand
of the blushing Agnes, and led her from the house
to the vehicle that was still waiting.</p>

<p>“Now, madam, you may depart,” he said sternly
to Mrs. Mortimer, as soon as he had seated himself
in the cab, opposite to Agnes.</p>

<p>The old woman turned sulkily away, muttering
threats of vengeance; but these were unheeded by
the chivalrous Trevelyan, who gave hasty instructions
to the driver, and the vehicle rolled rapidly
on towards Kentish Town.</p>

<p>Agnes could not do otherwise than appreciate
all the delicacy of Lord William’s conduct towards
her; for it is no disparagement to the extreme artlessness
of her mind to state that she comprehended
wherefore he had compelled Mrs. Mortimer
to wait until they had quitted the house. But she
could scarcely collect her bewildered ideas into a
settled state&mdash;so rapid was the whirl of incidents
and adventures through which she was doomed to
pass on this memorable night. Had she paused to
reflect upon her position, with that seriousness
which it required, she would have requested the
nobleman to conduct her at once to the dwelling
of the Misses Theobald: but he had deported himself
towards her with the generosity of a brother,
and she acted in obedience to his suggestions without
waiting to analyse them. In a word, she was
full of confidence and ingenuous reliance in him;
and she felt as if she had suddenly found a stanch
and sincere friend in the midst of cruel difficulties
and deep embarrassments. A dreamy kind of repose
stole over her as she was borne along in the vehicle:
and yet she not only heard the few remarks
which her companion addressed to her, but likewise
answered them in a befitting manner.</p>

<p>On his side Trevelyan was a prey to the strangest
excitement; accident having not only thus procured
him the acquaintanceship of her whom he loved
so fondly, but having likewise placed them in a
relative position, establishing as it were a friendship&mdash;almost
an intimacy. Moreover, had he not
touched her delicate white hand&mdash;touched it gently,
it is true, and without venturing to press it,&mdash;but
still touched it, and even held it for a few moments
in his own? Had he not discovered, too, that if
she appeared surpassingly lovely when seen from a
distance, a nearer contemplation of her charms
was only calculated to enhance his admiration and
strengthen his devotion? And, lastly, had not the
musical tones of her silver voice been breathed in
his hearing, wafting words that were addressed
to himself, and making every fibre in his heart
vibrate deliciously to the dulcet sounds? Yes&mdash;all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
this he felt and appreciated; and he was
happy.</p>

<div id="i_313" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_313.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The conversation that passed between them during
the drive to Kentish Town was slight, and
chiefly confined to such observations as a well-bred
gentleman would address to a lady under circumstances
of embarrassment, and to such responses
as those remarks were calculated to elicit. The
young nobleman was careful to avoid any allusion
to the letter which he had sent to Agnes, or to the
circumstances that had thus thrown them so singularly
together; and she, understanding his forbearance
and perceiving his unwillingness to take
the least advantage of her peculiar position, felt her
esteem&mdash;we might almost say her <em>love</em>&mdash;increase in
his favour.</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes the cab stopped at the
gate of a beautiful villa; and as the orient sky was
now flickering with the first struggling beams
of a summer sunrise, Agnes was enabled to obtain
a tolerably distinct view of the picturesque spot.
The fresh breeze, too, fanned her countenance, recalling
the roses to her damask cheeks; and as she
threw back the shining masses of hair from her
forehead, Trevelyan’s eye could trace the blue veins
so delicately marked beneath the white skin of that
fair and polished brow.</p>

<p>On alighting at the entrance to the villa, Trevelyan
and his beautiful companion were both
struck by the glimmering of lights which shone
through the divisions in the parlour shutters, and
the rays of which, peeping forth, struggled with
sickly effect against the dawning of a new day.
Those lights, too, were evidently moving about;
and it was therefore clear that the inmates of the
dwelling were astir even at that early hour.</p>

<p>The summons at the front door was almost immediately
responded to by a female servant, who,
in reply to the young nobleman’s questions, stated
that Mrs. Sefton was at home, and had risen thus
early in order to make preparations for removal to
a new house which she had taken in another suburb
of London.</p>

<p>Trevelyan and Agnes were accordingly admitted
forthwith; and the domestic conducted them to the
parlour, where Mrs. Sefton was busily engaged in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
packing up her effects. She was much surprised
when she heard Trevelyan’s voice, and immediately
apprehended that some misfortune was in store for
her&mdash;some evil tidings, perhaps, relative to Sir Gilbert
Heathcote.</p>

<p>But scarcely had Agnes reached the threshold of
the apartment, when&mdash;the moment Mrs. Sefton
turned to receive her visitors&mdash;the young girl gave
vent to an ejaculation of mingled astonishment and
joy, and, bounding forward, was in the next instant
clasped in that lady’s arms.</p>

<p>“My dearest&mdash;dearest mother!”</p>

<p>“Agnes&mdash;my beloved child!”</p>

<p>These were the words which explained to Trevelyan
the scene that he now witnessed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXXI">CHAPTER CLXXXI.<br />

<span class="medium">EXPLANATIONS.</span></h2>

<p>The reader need scarcely be informed that if Lord
William were amazed at the discovery of the relationship
subsisting between two ladies whom he
had hitherto deemed to be perfect strangers to each
other, Mrs. Sefton was not less astonished at having
her daughter thus unexpectedly introduced into her
presence and at such an unseasonable hour.</p>

<p>For a few minutes, however, she had no leisure
for reflection,&mdash;joy at once more being enabled to
strain that beloved child to her bosom triumphing
over all other considerations.</p>

<p>But when the first gush of feeling had somewhat
subsided, a horrible suspicion entered her mind.</p>

<p>Could Lord William have seduced Agnes away
from the care of those friends to whom she was consigned?&mdash;could
he have entertained the vile and
derogatory idea of using the villa as the receptacle
for a young creature whom he intended to make
his mistress?&mdash;did he suppose that Mrs. Sefton
would lend herself to such an atrocious proceeding?&mdash;and
had he unconsciously brought the child to
the house of the mother, thinking to make a pander
of the latter to the dishonour of the former?</p>

<p>All these thoughts flashed with lightning rapidity
to Mrs. Sefton’s mind, as, disengaging herself from
the embraces of Agnes, she turned towards Lord
William, and, with flashing eyes and quivering lips,
peremptorily demanded an explanation of the circumstances
which had rendered him the companion
of her daughter at such an hour.</p>

<p>Trevelyan instantly divined what was passing in
the lady’s bosom; and, perceiving at once the awkwardness
of his position and the grounds of her
suspicions, he hastily gave such explanations as
were satisfactory to Mrs. Sefton, Agnes herself corroborating
the main facts.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my dear friend,” said the now happy
mother, taking Trevelyan’s hand and pressing it fervently
in token of gratitude,&mdash;“pardon me if for a
moment I entertained the most unjust and derogatory
suspicions.”</p>

<p>“Mention them not, madam,” exclaimed Trevelyan
warmly: “but let your daughter seek that repose
which she must so deeply need&mdash;and I will then, as
a man of honour, explain to you how I became interested
in her, and how it was that the Mrs. Mortimer
whose name has already been mentioned happened
to bring her to my house.”</p>

<p>A slight smile&mdash;almost of archness&mdash;played upon
the lips of Mrs. Sefton, as she turned towards
Agnes,&mdash;a smile which seemed to intimate that she
already knew more than the young nobleman
fancied, but was not vexed with him in consequence
of the facts thus known to her.</p>

<p>“Come with me, dearest girl,” she said, addressing
her daughter, “and I will conduct you to a
chamber where you may obtain a few hours’ repose.
You need not bid farewell to his lordship; for I have
no doubt he will honour us with his presence at
breakfast&mdash;when you will see him again.”</p>

<p>Agnes blushed and cast down her eyes&mdash;she
scarcely knew why&mdash;as these words met her ears;&mdash;and
again the arch smile played upon her mother’s
lips. Trevelyan observed that there was some mystery,
though not of a disagreeable nature, in Mrs.
Sefton’s manner; and in a moment&mdash;with galvanic
swiftness&mdash;the reminiscence of the tears upon the
portrait and the lost letter flashed to his mind.</p>

<p>The ladies disappeared, and Trevelyan threw himself
in a chair, to muse upon the discovery which he
had thus made, and which was well calculated to
afford him pleasure. Inasmuch as it was evident
from Mrs. Sefton’s manner and the significant words
she had uttered relative to the meeting at the breakfast-table,
that she was <em>not</em> inimical to his suit.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she returned to the room.</p>

<p>“My dear madam,” said Trevelyan, rising and advancing
to meet her, “you already know that I love
your daughter Agnes&mdash;that I adore her?”</p>

<p>“And you have already divined how the letter
which you must have missed, came to be lost?” returned
Mrs. Sefton, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam&mdash;and I likewise observed the trace
of a tear upon the portrait which I painted from
memory,” continued the young nobleman.</p>

<p>“Oh! then you can make allowance for the feelings
of a mother!” exclaimed Mrs. Sefton, with enthusiasm:
“and you will forgive me that act of
apparent ingratitude&mdash;nay, of treachery&mdash;I mean
the purloining of a document so sacred as a sealed
letter&mdash;and at a moment, too, when I sought your
aid, and you so generously afforded it?”</p>

<p>“It is for me to implore your pardon as a mother
for having dared to address such a letter to your
daughter,” said Trevelyan, with some degree of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Then let us accord mutual forgiveness,” exclaimed
the lady, extending her hand, which was
immediately pressed with the fervour of gratitude.
I am well aware that my conduct in taking that
letter was improper to a degree,” she continued,
after a short pause: “but pray consider all the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I do&mdash;I do,” interrupted Trevelyan; “and you
have nothing to explain. Oh! I am delighted at the
discovery that the beautiful and much-loved Agnes
is your daughter&mdash;delighted also to think that, by
the perusal of that letter, you have acquired the certainty
of the ardent and honourable feelings which
animate me with regard to her.”</p>

<p>“And Agnes is deserving of your affection, my
lord,” said Mrs. Sefton: “I am convinced that she
is in heart and soul all she appears to be&mdash;ingenuousness,
amiability, candour, and virtue!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am well assured of the value of that jewel
which, in due time, I shall implore you to bestow
upon me!” exclaimed the generous and impassioned
young nobleman: “and I rejoice that you not only
observed the letter in my apartment, but that you
also took it; for it has&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It has enabled me to discover my child, whom
I had fruitlessly sought for years, and whom I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
longed to embrace!” added Mrs. Sefton, wiping
away the tears of joy that started to her eye-lashes.
“Oh! my lord, you may conceive my surprise&mdash;my
joy, when I beheld that portrait in your portfolio.
Although I had never seen my child since her infancy,
yet it seemed as if a heavenly inspiration
imparted to me the conviction that I was then
gazing on her likeness. At all events I murmured
to myself, while contemplating it, ‘<em>Such must Agnes
now be: tall, beautiful, and with innocence depicted
in her countenance, even as this portrait.</em>’ And then
I wept as I thought that the dear girl was lost to
me for ever&mdash;buried in some seclusion by <em>one</em> who
cruelly kept us separated! I closed the portfolio&mdash;rose&mdash;and
mechanically approached the mantel.
There I beheld the letter&mdash;and the address immediately
rivetted my attention. ‘<em>Miss Agnes Vernon!</em>’
Oh! yes&mdash;it was my own dear daughter whose portrait
I had been contemplating; and I was not
mistaken! For I may be allowed to say, without
incurring the imputation of vanity, that in the
countenance of the portrait I traced my own lineaments;
and then&mdash;on discovering the letter&mdash;I felt
assured that nature’s promptings had not been misinterpreted
by me! Because I knew that Agnes
passed under the name of Vernon: that fact I
accidentally learnt years ago, through my husband’s
solicitor, who was permitted from time to time to
give me the assurance that my daughter was alive
and in health. You can now conceive, my dear
friend, how strong were the emotions which agitated
within me, and which influenced me in seizing upon
the letter&mdash;tearing it open&mdash;and devouring its contents.”</p>

<p>“And your first impression was doubtless one
of indignation against me for having dared thus to
address your daughter?” said Lord William Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“Far from it, I can assure you!” returned Mrs.
Sefton, in a tone of the deepest sincerity. “I
already knew enough of your character to be well
aware that you were honourable in principle and
generous in heart! and the whole tenour of the
letter was respectful and delicate, though earnest
and decided,” added the lady, with a smile, as Trevelyan’s
cheeks were suffused with a deep blush.
“Besides, my dear friend,” she continued, in a serious
tone, “I have acquainted you with the history of
the crushed hopes and the blighted affections of
my own early years&mdash;and I should be the last person
in the world to raise an obstacle in the way of
a pure and honourable attachment on the part of
those in whom I felt interested.”</p>

<p>“Then you approve of my suit in respect to your
daughter?” exclaimed Trevelyan, his handsome
countenance becoming animated with joy; “and
you will not refuse me her hand?”</p>

<p>“When she attains her twenty-first year, my
lord,” replied Mrs. Sefton, in a solemn tone. “Until
then I dare not dispose of her hand in marriage.
She is now nineteen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Two years to wait!” exclaimed Trevelyan,
mournfully: “and in the mean time how many adverse
circumstances may occur to separate us!”</p>

<p>“Yours is the age when Hope smiles most
brightly,” said Mrs. Sefton; “and if your affection
for my daughter be as strong as you represent it,
believe me, my dear friend, that time will not impair&mdash;but
rather strengthen and confirm it.”</p>

<p>“Were years and years to elapse, ere Agnes could
become mine, I should not love her the less!” exclaimed
Lord William. “But this may not be so
with her: indeed, I have no reason to hope&mdash;much
less any assurance&mdash;that she in any degree reciprocates
my passion.”</p>

<p>“Agnes will not prove indifferent to your lordship’s
merits,” said Mrs. Sefton, encouragingly.
“But we must postpone any farther conversation
on this subject until another occasion. Behold the
confusion that prevails in the house,” she continued,
in a more cheerful tone, as she glanced round the
room at the various boxes and packages on which she
had been busied when the arrival of Trevelyan and
her daughter had compelled her to desist from her
occupation. “I am about to remove this morning to
a beautiful little villa which I have taken at Bayswater.
By those means I hope to destroy all trace
of my new abode, in respect to those who might
seek to tear Agnes from my arms. But I have the
law with me:&mdash;yes, the law is in my favour,” she
added, in an emphatic tone; “and I will not surrender
up my daughter to <em>him</em>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She checked herself, and hastily advancing to the
window, opened the shutters.</p>

<p>It was now quite light; and, having extinguished
the candles, Mrs. Sefton returned to her task of
placing various valuable effects in a box. Trevelyan
volunteered his assistance, which was accepted;
for circumstances had placed him and the
lady on a footing of the most friendly intimacy
together.</p>

<p>“I received your note on my return last evening,”
said Mrs. Sefton, after a pause; “and I regretted
much to find that you had obtained no clue
to the place where Sir Gilbert Heathcote is confined.”</p>

<p>“But you must remember, my dear madam,
that no time has been lost,” observed Trevelyan.
“It was only yesterday morning that we acquired
the knowledge of Sir Gilbert’s real position; and I
have employed my valet Fitzgeorge, who is an intelligent
and faithful man, to obtain an interview
with Green, Heathcote’s clerk, and bribe him to
serve us. From the specimen of the fellow’s character
which we had yesterday morning in this very
room, I entertain but little doubt of Fitzgeorge’s
success.”</p>

<p>“God grant that it may be so!” exclaimed Mrs.
Sefton, fervently. “And if you succeed in discovering
the den where Sir Gilbert is confined, how
do you intend to proceed?”</p>

<p>“Still by artifice, my dear madam. We must
fight that bad man, James Heathcote, with his own
weapons&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! think you not, my lord, that our unfortunate
friend is hemmed round with all imaginable
precautions to prevent his flight?” demanded Mrs.
Sefton.</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” answered Trevelyan: “but the janitors
and dependants of a lunatic-asylum are as accessible
as other people to the influence of gold.”</p>

<p>“I now more than ever, if possible, desire the
restoration of Sir Gilbert,” said Mrs. Sefton: then,
after a pause, she added in a low and peculiar tone,
“I have many&mdash;many strange things yet to tell you,
Lord William: but the present is not the most fitting
occasion. In a few days I will explain every
thing&mdash;yes, everything,” she said, emphatically;
“and thenceforth there will be no secrets between
you and me.”</p>

<p>The lady again applied herself to the task of preparing
for her removal; and the young nobleman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
assisted her with as much kindliness of manner and
good-tempered alacrity as if he were her brother,
or already her son-in-law. In this manner the
hours passed away until the time-piece struck nine,
when Agnes descended to the breakfast which was
now served up. A messenger was despatched to
the Misses Theobald to give them an assurance of
the young maiden’s safety; and in the course of
the day the mother and daughter, accompanied by
Lord William, removed to the beautiful villa prepared
for the ladies’ reception at Bayswater.</p>

<p>Lord William remained with them until the
evening, when he took his leave&mdash;but not without
observing that pleasure beamed in the eyes of Agnes
as he intimated his intention of becoming a frequent
visitor at the villa.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXXII">CHAPTER CLXXXII.<br />

<span class="medium">LAURA MORTIMER’S NEW INTRIGUES.</span></h2>

<p>We must now return to Laura Mortimer, whom
we left in Paris, and of whom we have lost sight for
some time.</p>

<p>It was in the evening of the fourth day after the
incidents recorded in the preceding chapter, that
Laura was seated in her handsome drawing-room,
wrapped up in deep meditation.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were not, however, of a disagreeable
nature;&mdash;for ever and anon the fire of triumph
flashed from her fine eyes, and her rich moist lips
were wreathed into a smile.</p>

<p>She held a book open in her hand; but her gaze
was fixed upon the ceiling as she lay, rather than
sate, on the voluptuous cushions of the purple velvet
ottoman.</p>

<p>The windows were open, and a gentle evening
breeze, which had succeeded the stifling heat of a
Parisian summer-day, fanned her countenance and
wantoned with the luxuriant ringlets that floated
over her naked shoulders,&mdash;those shoulders so
white, so plump, so exquisitely shaped!</p>

<p>The perfumes of choice flowers and the odour of
ravishing oriental scents rendered the atmosphere
fragrant: gold and silver fish were disporting in an
immense crystal globe which stood upon a marble
table between the casements&mdash;and two beautiful
canaries were carolling in a superb cage suspended
in one of those open windows.</p>

<p>On the table near which Laura was placed, stood
several crystal dishes containing the finest fruit
that the Parisian market could yield,&mdash;the luscious
pine, the refreshing melon, strawberries of extraordinary
size and exquisite flavour, cherries of the
richest red, and mulberries of the deepest purple.</p>

<p>A bottle of champagne stood in a cooler filled
with ice; and in the middle of the table was a
superb nosegay of flowers.</p>

<p>The entire appearance of the room and its appointments
was luxurious in the extreme,&mdash;comfort
being combined with elegance, and the means of
enjoyment distributed with taste;&mdash;while she&mdash;the
mistress of the place&mdash;the presiding genius of the
scene&mdash;was pillowed voluptuously upon the immense
velvet cushions. So complete was the abandonment
of her attitude, in her deep reverie, that
she seemed ten hundred times more charming than
when her artifice devised a thousand studied graces
in order to effect a conquest and captivate a lover.</p>

<p>One of her naked arms, plump, white, and beautifully
formed, lay across her person as the hand held
the book, on which the eyes rested not, and against
the dark binding of which the taper fingers were
set off in the dazzling purity of their complexion
and the rosy tint of the almond-shaped nails: the
other arm hung down negligently&mdash;not quite
straight, but gently rounded&mdash;the fingers of that
hand playing mechanically with the ottoman’s
golden fringe that swept the thick carpet. One of
her legs lay stretched completely upon the ottoman:
the other hung over the side, displaying the well-formed
foot, the delicate ankle, and the robust
swell of the calf. More voluptuously modelled
than Venus, but with all the elegance attributed
to the form of that fabled divinity,&mdash;handsome as
Juno, without the stern imperiousness that characterised
the queen of heaven,&mdash;and with that subdued
nobility of demeanour which Diana, when out
of sight of her attendant huntresses, might have
been supposed to wear,&mdash;Laura Mortimer united in
her own person the most fascinating of the charms
belonging to the three principal goddesses of heathen
worship.</p>

<p>But let us endeavour to ascertain the subject of
her thoughts, as she lay thus wrapped up in a deep
reverie.</p>

<p>“Fortune appears resolved to favour me, and I
accept the auspicious omen with joy. The Marquis
is in my power&mdash;is my slave&mdash;inextricably shackled
by my silken chains! Four short days have been
sufficient to accomplish this victory. When first
introduced to him in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, I saw that
he regarded me with attention&mdash;nay, with admiration;
and I that moment signalled him out as the
man who is destined to place me in a proud position&mdash;to
render me independent of Charles Hatfield’s
hated father! The evening before last I met him
for the second time: this was at the party given by
my music-master. The nobleman was almost instantly
by my side, as soon as I made my appearance;
and I knew full well how to gain his favour.
When handsome young men approached me, I received
them coldly, and continued my discourse
with the Marquis in a more animated and friendly
style than before. I even hinted to him&mdash;or rather
suffered him to believe that it was a relief to escape
from the frivolities of the average run of conversation,
in the indulgence of discourse on intellectual
subjects. I saw that the old man was flattered&mdash;that
he thought highly of me: in a word, I secured
his esteem as I had already acquired his admiration.
We sate next to each other at supper; and he lavished
all his attentions upon me&mdash;attentions which I accepted
with an air as if they came from a young and
handsome gallant. The Marquis handed me to my
carriage, and solicited permission to call. I signified
an assent with an ingenuousness that could
not possibly have seemed affected; and he squeezed
my hand slightly as he bade me farewell. On the
following afternoon he called: this was yesterday&mdash;and
he remained a long time. Two hours passed&mdash;doubtless
like two minutes to him: and I was completely
triumphant. Never did I appear to such
advantage: my glass told me that I was radiantly
beautiful&mdash;and I could observe full well that my
manner&mdash;my conversation&mdash;and the delicate artifices
I called to aid, were pre-eminently successful. The
old man was ready to fall upon his knees and
worship me: he was in that humour when he would
have laid his whole fortune at my feet. He appeared
to be longing to throw his arms around my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
neck, and exclaim, ‘<em>Laura, I adore you!</em>’ But
when I had excited him to the highest possible
pitch, I suddenly directed his attention to some subject
of comparative indifference; and thus did I
play with his feelings during two long hours. He
went away half crazy&mdash;dazzled, bewildered, not
knowing what to think or how to act&mdash;intoxicated
with sensual passions mingling with the purer sentiments
of a profound admiration and a cordial
esteem. Then this morning he called again, and I
made him become my companion at luncheon. I
affected to be rejoiced that he had thus unexpectedly
dropped in, as I had previously felt low-spirited and
dull. He seemed charmed that his presence was
calculated to cheer me: It was a delicate compliment
paid to his conversational powers&mdash;and he
was flattered and pleased. Oh! how admirably
did I wind myself, as it were, around him during
the three hours that he remained with me this
morning: how successfully did I insinuate myself,
as one may say, into his very soul;&mdash;not seizing
upon his heart by a sudden attack&mdash;but gaining
possession of it by means the more sure because so
stealthy,&mdash;not carrying that heart by storm&mdash;but
gradually and imperceptibly enmeshing it in snares
and toils whence it never can escape, so long as my
real character shall remain a mystery to him. Yes&mdash;and
this morning, too, was he not a thousand
times on the point of falling upon his knees, and
exclaiming,‘<em>Laura, I adore you!</em>’ But still I tantalised
him&mdash;still I worked him up to the highest
possible pitch of excitement, and then suddenly discouraged
him by some word or gesture that threw a
coldness on all I had before said, and which yet
would admit of no positive interpretation so as to
render him hopeless altogether. And now he is to
return again&mdash;this evening,&mdash;to return, by his own
solicitation;&mdash;and this evening&mdash;yes&mdash;this evening,”
thought Laura, her lips wreathing into a smile of
triumph,&mdash;“he <em>shall</em> fall down at my feet and exclaim,
‘<em>Laura, I adore you!</em>’”</p>

<p>Thus ran the meditations of this dangerous woman,&mdash;so
strong in the consciousness of her almost
superhuman beauty&mdash;so confident in the power of
her matchless charms and in the witchery of her
guileful tongue!</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;four days will have been sufficient to reduce
the proud English noble to the condition of a
captive kneeling at my feet.” she continued, in her
silent but triumphant reverie. “What other woman
in the world can thus effect a conquest with
such amazing rapidity? The tigress hunts for her
prey&mdash;pursuing the affrighted deer through bramble
and through brake&mdash;by the margin of the lake in
the depths of the forest&mdash;amidst the trackless
mazes of the wild woods,&mdash;a long&mdash;tedious&mdash;and
fatiguing chase, with the possibility of escape for
the intended victim after all. But the boa-constrictor
fixes its eyes upon its prey&mdash;fascinates it&mdash;renders
it incapable of retreat&mdash;compels it even to
advance nearer and nearer to its mouth&mdash;plays with
it&mdash;tantalizes it&mdash;sets every feeling and every emotion
into fluttering agitation&mdash;and even when about
to gorge it, licks it over with his caresses. And
thus do I secure my prey! I am the anaconda
amongst women: none whom I choose to make my
victim can escape from the influence of my witchery&mdash;the
sphere of my fascination! With me it is no
long, tedious, and wearisome chase: ’tis instantaneous
capture and an easy triumph!”</p>

<p>And again the peculiar smile&mdash;half haughtiness,
half sweetness&mdash;returned to the lips of the peerless
beauty, who felt herself to be ten thousand times
more powerful in the possession of her transcendent
charms, than an Amazonian Queen clothed in armour
of proof from head to heel.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bell at the outer door of her suite
of apartments announced the coming of a visitor;
and in a few moments the Marquis of Delmour was
ushered into the room.</p>

<p>Laura had already assumed a sitting posture;
and she now rose to receive the English nobleman.</p>

<p>“Good evening, charming Miss Mortimer,” said
the Marquis, taking her hand and gently touching
it with his lips: then, leading her to the ottoman,
and placing himself at a short distance from her,
he looked at her tenderly, observing, “You perceive
that I am punctual to the hour at which I was to
make my appearance according to the kind permission
you granted me.”</p>

<p>“Your lordship is most generous thus to condescend
to enliven an hour that would otherwise
be passed in loneliness by me,” said Laura, bending
upon him all the glory of her fine bright eyes and
revealing the splendour of her brilliant teeth.</p>

<p>“Beautiful, intellectual, and agreeable as you
are, Miss Mortimer,” observed the nobleman, “it
is utterly impossible that you can feel yourself indebted
to an old man like me for the recreation of a
leisure hour. You would only need to throw open
your drawing-rooms to the <em>&eacute;lite</em> of Paris,to be surrounded
by admiring guests.”</p>

<p>“And what if I prefer an hour of intellectual
conversation to an entire evening of empty formalities,
ceremonial frivolities, and the inane routine of
fashionable <em>r&eacute;unions</em>?” asked Laura, with an affectation
of candour which seemed most real&mdash;most
natural.</p>

<p>“You possess a mind the strength and soundness
of which surprise me,” exclaimed the Marquis of
Delmour, enthusiastically. “How is it that, rich
and beautiful, young and courted, as you are, you
can have taken so just a view of the world,&mdash;that
you have learnt to prefer solid enjoyments to artificial
pleasures,&mdash;and that you can so well discriminate
between the <em>real</em> on which the gay and giddy
close their eyes, and the <em>ideal</em> or the <em>unreal</em> which
they so much worship?”</p>

<p>“You would ask me, my lord, I presume, wherefore
I dislike that turmoil of fashionable life which
brings one in contact with persons who flatter in a
meaningless manner, and who believe that a woman
is best pleased with him who most skilfully gilds
his <em>pretty nothings</em>. It is, my lord, because I do not
estimate the world according to the usual standard,&mdash;because
I am not dazzled by outside glitter and
external show. If an officer in the army be introduced
to me, I am not captivated by his splendid
epaulets and his waving plumes: I wait to hear
his discourse before I form <em>my</em> estimate of his character.”</p>

<p>“Then neither youth nor riches will prove the
principal qualifications of him who shall be fortunate
enough to win your hand?” said the Marquis,
fixing his eyes in an impassioned manner upon the
syren.</p>

<p>“Oh! you would speak to me upon the topic of
marriage!” exclaimed Laura, laughing gaily. “To
tell your lordship the truth, I should be sorry to
surrender up my freedom beyond all possibility of
release, to any man in existence.”</p>

<p>“What!” ejaculated the old nobleman: “do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
you mean me to infer that you will never
marry?”</p>

<p>“I have more than half made up my mind to
that resolution,” responded Laura, casting down
her eyes and forcing a blush to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Never marry!” cried the Marquis, in unfeigned
surprise. “And what if you happened to fall in
love with some fine, handsome, eligible young
man?”</p>

<p>“In the first place it is by no means necessary
that a man should be fine, handsome, or young for
me to love him,” answered Laura, as if in the most
ingenuous way in the world; “and when I <em>do</em> love,
it is not a whit the more imperious that the person
or the priest should rivet my hand to that of the
object of my affections. It is within the power of
man to unite hands&mdash;and that is a mockery: but
God alone can unite hearts&mdash;and that is a solemn
and sacred compact that should be effected in the
sight of heaven only.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely understand you, beautiful and mysterious
being!” exclaimed the Marquis, drawing
nearer to the syren, who did not appear to notice
the movement.</p>

<p>“I am aware that some of my notions are not
altogether in accordance with those of society in
general,” observed Laura, with an affectation of
reserve and diffidence: “but since the conversation
has taken this turn, I do not hesitate to admit
that I do hold peculiar opinions with respect to
marriage.”</p>

<p>“You would have me understand, Miss Mortimer,”
said the Marquis, “that were you to find
your affections enchained by some deserving individual,
you would not hesitate to join your destinies
to his, without the intervention of the Church to
cement the union.”</p>

<p>“Your lordship has interpreted my meaning in
language so delicate as to be almost ambiguous,”
observed Laura. “And yet why should the truth
be thus wrapped up in verbiage? I do not entertain
opinions which I am afraid to look in the face.
God forbid! In a word, then, I would ten thousand
times rather become the mistress of the man
I loved, than the wife of him whom I abhorred;&mdash;and
in loving the former, and with him loving
me, is it not that union of hearts which, as I ere
now said, should be effected only in the sight of
heaven?”</p>

<p>“And have you ever yet loved?” asked the nobleman,
in a tone of profound emotion, as he gazed
long and ardently upon the splendid countenance
whereon the light from the casements now fell
with a Rembrandt effect, delineating the faultless
profile against the obscurity that had already begun
to occupy the end of the room most remote from
the windows.</p>

<p>“Oh! my lord, that is a question which you can
only ask me when we come to know each other
better!” exclaimed Laura, after a few moments’
pause.</p>

<p>“And yet I already feel as if I had known you
for as many years as our acquaintance numbers
days,” said the Marquis. “Methought yesterday&mdash;and
this morning too&mdash;that a species of intimacy&mdash;a
kind of impromptu friendship had sprung up
between us; and now you are somewhat cold
towards me&mdash;your manner is not the same&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If I have been guilty of any want of courtesy
towards your lordship, I should be truly&mdash;deeply
grieved,” exclaimed Laura, surveying the nobleman
with well affected astonishment at the accusation
uttered against her.</p>

<p>“Oh! use not such chilling language, Laura&mdash;Miss
Mortimer, I mean!” cried the old nobleman,
half inclined to throw himself at her feet and implore
her to take compassion upon him. “But I
an mad&mdash;I am insane to appeal to you thus!” he
continued, in a species of rage against himself.
“How can I suppose that the society of an old
man like me is agreeable to a young and beautiful
creature such as you!&mdash;how can I give way to those
glorious but fatal delusions that have occupied my
brain for the last forty-eight hours! Oh! Miss
Mortimer&mdash;would that I had never seen you!”</p>

<p>And the old nobleman, covering his face with his
hands, literally sobbed like a youthful lover quarrelling
with an adored mistress.</p>

<p>“My lord&mdash;my lord, what have I done to offend
you?” demanded Laura, as if deeply excited; and,
seizing his hands, she drew them away from his
countenance, well aware that the contact of her
soft and warm flesh would make the blood that
age had partially chilled, circulate with speed and
heat in his veins.</p>

<p>“If you had attempted my life,” replied the Marquis,
with fervid emphasis, “I should rejoice at a
deed that would elicit such kindness from you as
you manifest towards me now!”</p>

<p>And thus speaking, he raised her hands to his
lips and covered them with kisses.</p>

<p>“Tell me&mdash;how did I offend you?” she asked, in
a voice that was melting and musical even to
ravishment.</p>

<p>“Oh! let us think not of what has passed,” he
exclaimed: “but bless me with the assurance that
you can entertain a sentiment of friendship for the
old man!”</p>

<p>“I would rather possess your friendship, my lord,
than that of the handsomest and wealthiest young
gentleman whom we met at the party the other
evening,” responded the artful woman, still abandoning
her hands to the Marquis. “Did you not
observe that I was pleased with your attentions&mdash;that
I refused to dance in order that I might remain
seated next to you, and listening to your
conversation&mdash;that when the gay moths of fashion
approached me with their fulsome compliments, I
exhibited signs of impatience, and by my coldness
compelled them to retreat&mdash;that I gave no encouragement
to them in any way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” interrupted the enraptured Marquis:
“I noticed all <em>that</em>&mdash;and were I a young man I
should have felt myself justified in addressing you
in the language of passion&mdash;aye, of ardent and
sincere affection. But&mdash;although such are indeed
my sentiments towards you&mdash;I perceive all the folly
and ridicule of daring to give utterance to them
in your presence: yet God knows that I am ready
to lay my fortune at your feet&mdash;and could I offer
to place the coronet of a marchioness upon your
brow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Were you in the position to do so, I should refuse
it,” said Laura, emphatically. “All the rest I
might listen to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you are aware that I am married?” interrupted
the nobleman, fixing an earnest and
enquiring gaze upon her beauteous countenance.</p>

<p>“Rumour declares as much,” replied Laura;
“and it likewise avers that you are not happy in
your matrimonial connexion. I pity you from the
bottom of my heart&mdash;and I behold in the fact itself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
a new argument in support of my own peculiar
tenets relative to marriage-ties;&mdash;for assuredly you
are endowed with qualities calculated to render a
woman happy&mdash;or I am deeply, deeply deceived.”</p>

<p>“Ah! It is a sad tale&mdash;and I dare not venture
upon the narration now,” said the Marquis, with a
profound sigh. “But should our acquaintance
continue&mdash;as I ardently hope it may&mdash;I will some
day give you the fullest and most ample explanations.
And you yourself, charming creature&mdash;is
there not some mystery attached to you? How
happens it that at your age you should be so well
acquainted with the world?&mdash;how is it that you
seem free to follow the bent of your own inclinations,
uncontrolled even by your mother? For
rumour declares that you have a mother alive&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am independent of her in a pecuniary point of
view, my lord,” interrupted Laura; “and I am determined
to consult my own ideas of happiness, instead
of adopting the standard of enjoyment and
pleasure established by the fashionable world.”</p>

<p>“Would to heavens that it lay in my power to
ensure your happiness&mdash;or even to contribute to it!”
exclaimed the Marquis, gazing upon her with admiration
and ardent passion. “Long years have
elapsed since I encountered any woman who inspired
me with even half the interest that I feel in
you; and it seems to me that I become young again
when in your sweet society.”</p>

<p>“And, on my side,” answered Laura, casting
down her eyes and assuming a bashful demeanour,
“I do not hesitate to admit that I experience greater
enjoyment from your conversation than from that
of any other nobleman or gentleman with whom I
am acquainted.”</p>

<p>“Just now, my sweet Miss Mortimer,” said the
Marquis, approaching still nearer to her, and speaking
in a tone that was low and tremulous with
emotion,&mdash;“just now you declared that ‘<em>all the rest
you might listen to</em>’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And I do not attempt to revoke the admission
that thus fell from my lips,” murmured the designing
young woman, turning a glance of half-timidity
and half-fondness upon the old nobleman, who, in
spite of a strong and vigorous intellect, was rendered
childish and plunged as it were into dotage
by the fascinating&mdash;ravishing influence of the
syren-enchantress.</p>

<p>“What am I to understand by those words?” he
asked, in an ecstacy of delight. “Oh! is it possible
that you can become something more to the old
man than a mere acquaintance&mdash;something more
than even a friend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I could wish to retain your good opinion&mdash;your
esteem for ever!” said Laura, now turning upon
him a countenance radiant with hope and joy.</p>

<p>“It is scarcely possible&mdash;I am dreaming&mdash;’tis a
delicious delusion&mdash;a heavenly vision!” murmured
the Marquis in broken sentences,&mdash;for he was
dazzled by the transcendant beauty of the houri
who seemed to encourage him in the aspirations
which he had formed.</p>

<p>“Is it, then, so extraordinary that I should have
learnt to love one who is so kind&mdash;so generous-hearted&mdash;so
intellectual as yourself?” asked Laura,
leaning towards him so that her fragrant breath
fanned his countenance and her forehead for an
instant touched his own.</p>

<p>“Great heaven! Is it possible that so much happiness
awaits me?” cried the Marquis, scarcely able
to believe his eyes or his ears: then, after gazing
upon her for a few instants with all the rapturous
ardour of a youthful lover, he sank upon his knees
before her, exclaiming, “<em>Laura, I adore you!</em>”</p>

<p>The designing woman’s triumph was complete:
the Marquis was inextricably entangled in her
snares;&mdash;and, throwing her arms around his neck,
she murmured, “Oh! it is an honour as well as a
joy to possess your love!”</p>

<p>Then the old man covered the charming young
woman’s countenance with kisses; and for several
minutes not a word was spoken between them. But
at length the Marquis, who could scarcely believe
that he had won a prize the possession of which all
the noblest, handsomest, and wealthiest young men
in Paris would envy him, began to speak upon the
course which it would be prudent for them to adopt.
Laura at once gave him to understand that she
should experience no sentiment of shame in appearing
as his mistress; and she undertook&mdash;as well
indeed she might do&mdash;to reconcile her mother to this
connexion which she had formed.</p>

<p>“Let us then return to England without delay,’
said the Marquis. “The business which has brought
me to Paris is now in such a position that an agent
may manage it for me. But tell me&mdash;is your mother
dependent upon you?”</p>

<p>“Entirely,” answered Laura, anticipating the
course which her noble lover was about to adopt.</p>

<p>“And your fortune is doubtless large?” he continued,
interrogatively.</p>

<p>“It is not nearly so large as rumour has alleged,”
was the reply. “Still it is a handsome competency
for one person.”</p>

<p>“Then, as there shall be nothing having even the
slightest appearance of selfishness in my attachment
towards you, Laura,” resumed the nobleman, “you
must immediately assign all your property to your
mother; and I will at once&mdash;yea, at once&mdash;give you
a proof of the boundless devotion with which you
have inspired me. Permit me the use of your desk
for a few moments.”</p>

<p>Laura rang the bell, and ordered Rosalie to bring
writing materials; and when this was done, the
marquis seated himself at the table and wrote something
upon a sheet of paper. He next penned a
letter, which he folded up, sealed, and addressed;
and, turning towards Laura, he said, “This draught,
beloved girl, is for the sum of sixty thousand pounds,
payable at sight at my bankers’ in London. This
letter, which you will have the kindness to send
through the post to-morrow, is to advise them of
the fact of such a cheque having been given, and to
prepare them to meet it, so that there may be no
hesitation in paying such a large amount. For it
will be my joy and delight to enrich you, my dearest
Laura; so that the old man may to some extent
repay the immense obligation under which he is
placed by the possession of such a heart as thine.
I would not have you remain wealthy through your
own resources: henceforth you must owe every
thing to me&mdash;for if you cannot be my wife in name,
you shall at least be the sharer of my fortune, as you
have consented to be the partner of my destinies.”</p>

<p>“Your generosity, my dear Marquis, only binds
me the more closely to you,” exclaimed Laura,
lavishing upon the old man the most exciting and
apparently fervent caresses. “At the same time
permit me to remind you that there is nothing selfish
in that affection which so suddenly sprang up in my
bosom towards you: because I am no needy adventuress&mdash;no
intriguing fortune-hunter,&mdash;and you are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
well aware that many a French nobleman would be
proud to lay his title at my feet, were I disposed
to decorate my brow with a coronet. My father&mdash;who,
as you have doubtless heard, accumulated some
money in India&mdash;left me well provided for; and
that fortune I shall cheerfully abandon to my mother,
preferring to remain dependent on yourself.”</p>

<p>“Ah! your father dwelt a long time in India!”
exclaimed the Marquis, as if struck by a sudden
idea. “Is it possible, then, that I could have encountered
your mother in England? But, no&mdash;that
woman could not have been the parent of such a
lovely, charming creature as yourself!”</p>

<p>“To whom do you allude, my lord?” demanded
Laura, now seized with the apprehension that her
mother might be known to the wealthy lover whom
she had succeeded in ensnaring, and whom she intended
to fleece of the greater portion of his fortune.</p>

<p>“It was but a momentary thought&mdash;it exists no
longer in my mind, dearest,” responded the nobleman,
who, as he gazed upon the bright and splendid
being before him, felt an ineffable disgust at having
even for an instant associated her in any way with
the loathsome old hag to whom he was alluding.
“The fact is,” he continued, “I met a certain
female in London&mdash;or rather, in the neighbourhood
of London&mdash;a short time ago&mdash;indeed, just before I
left England; and this woman bore the name of
Mortimer.”</p>

<p>“It is not altogether an uncommon one,” observed
Laura, maintaining an unruffled countenance,
though her heart palpitated with continued apprehension.</p>

<p>“The singularity of the coincidence is that the
female to whom I am alluding announces herself as
the widow of a General-officer who had died in
India,” resumed the Marquis.</p>

<p>“My lamented father was a merchant,” said
Laura.</p>

<p>“Then of course there can be no identity in that
case,” continued the nobleman. “Besides, having
an intimate acquaintance with all military matters&mdash;as
I myself held the post of Secretary at War
many years ago, and have since taken a deep interest
in that department&mdash;I am enabled to state that no
General-officer of the name of Mortimer has recently
died in India.”</p>

<p>“The woman, then, of whom you am speaking,
was an impostress?” said Laura, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“I have little doubt of it,” answered the marquis.
“But let us not dwell upon a subject so perfectly
indifferent to us. We were talking of our plans.
Will it suit you, dearest Laura, to quit Paris to-morrow,
or the day after at latest?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, if you will,” the young woman
hastened to reply: for she now trembled lest her
mother should suddenly return and perhaps prove,
though unintentionally, a marplot to all the plans
which her intriguing disposition had conceived.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, then, be it,” said the Marquis. “At
noon I shall call for you in my travelling-chariot.
We will return by easy stages to London; and, on
our arrival in the English capital, the handsomest
mansion that money can procure shall be fitted
up with all possible speed for your abode.”</p>

<p>“I care not for a splendid dwelling in London
itself,” replied Laura. “Rather let me have some
beautiful and retired villa in the suburbs, where you
can visit me at your leisure, and where we can pass
the hours together without intrusion on the part of
a host of visitors.”</p>

<p>“Your ideas on this subject concur with mine,”
observed the Marquis, enchanted with the belief
that Laura intended to retire from the fashionable
world and devote herself wholly to him. “The seclusion
of a charming villa will be delightful; and
I think I can promise,” he added with a smile,
“that the said villa will have more of my company
than my town mansion. But I shall now take my
departure&mdash;although with reluctance: it is however
necessary for me to make certain preparations
this evening, as I am to leave Paris thus unexpectedly
to-morrow. For a few hours, then, my Laura,
adieu&mdash;adieu!”</p>

<p>The old man embraced the young woman with the
most unfeigned&mdash;unaffected fondness; and as his
arms were cast about her neck, and he felt her bosom
heaving against his chest, he longed to implore her
to allow him to remain with her until the morning&mdash;for
the dalliance and the toyings he had already
enjoyed had inflamed his blood, and he aspired to be
completely happy without delay. But he feared lest
he should offend her by any manifestations of sensual
longings; for he flattered himself that the
connexion which had commenced between them had
its origin in sentiment on her side. He accordingly
withdrew&mdash;but reluctantly&mdash;from her embrace; and
took his departure, promising to call for her punctually
at noon on the following day.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXXIII">CHAPTER CLXXXIII.<br />

<span class="medium">AN UNEXPECTED VISIT AND A DREADED
ARRIVAL.</span></h2>

<p>The moment Laura heard the outer door close
behind the Marquis of Delmour, she exclaimed
aloud, “I have triumphed! I have triumphed! He
is in my power&mdash;he fell at my feet&mdash;he said, ‘<em>Laura,
I adore you!</em>’&mdash;and the proof of his utter credulity
is here&mdash;here!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she clutched the draught for sixty
thousand pounds&mdash;devoured it with her eyes&mdash;and
then secured it in her writing-desk.</p>

<p>“Yes: sixty thousand pounds!” she murmured to
herself, as she resumed her voluptuously reclining
position upon the ottoman;&mdash;“sixty thousand
pounds&mdash;gained with but little trouble and in a
short time! It would scarcely matter if I never
touched another piece of gold from his purse; for I
am now independent of him&mdash;of the hated Hatfields&mdash;of
all the world! But I will not abandon my
doating English Marquis in a hurry: I will not cast
aside a nobleman who is so generous&mdash;so rich&mdash;so
confiding! No&mdash;no: he will be worth two hundred
thousand pounds to me;&mdash;and then&mdash;yes&mdash;<em>then</em>, I
may espouse a peer of high title! My fortune is
assured&mdash;my destiny is within the range of prophecy.
I have taken a tremendous step this evening: an
hour has seen me grow suddenly rich&mdash;already the
possessor of sixty thousand pounds! Thanks to
this more than human beauty of mine&mdash;thanks to
that witchery of manner which I know so well how
to assume&mdash;and thanks also to that fascinating influence
wherewith I can invest my language at will,
the Marquis has become my slave. Thus does the
strong-minded&mdash;the resolute&mdash;the intellectual man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
succumb to woman, when she dazzles him with her
loveliness and bewilders him with her guile. Sixty
thousand pounds now own me as their mistress!
’Tis glorious to possess great wealth: but ’tis an
elysian happiness&mdash;a burning joy&mdash;a proud triumph
to feel that I am released from the thraldom of
those Hatfields&mdash;or rather from a state of dependence
upon the father of him whom I lately loved so
well! And my mother, too&mdash;my selfish, intriguing,
deceitful old mother, who has ever hoped to make
a profitable market of my charms, and hold despotic
sway over me at the same time,&mdash;she is no longer
necessary to me&mdash;and I may in a moment assert my
independence should she dare to attempt to tyrannise
again. The mad old fool! to fancy that she
will succeed in discovering Torrens,&mdash;or, even if she
did, to hope that she could compel him to disgorge
the treasures which he has perilled his life here and
his soul hereafter to gain! She will return to me
penniless&mdash;totally dependent upon me; and I shall
allow her a small income on condition that she
locates herself in some obscure spot, whence her
machinations and her intrigues cannot reach me.
Not for worlds would I have her fastened to my
apron-strings in London&mdash;that London whither I
am about to return, and where I may yet hope to
punish that Mr. Hatfield who for a time so savagely
triumphed over me! No&mdash;my mother must be forced
into seclusion; her notoriety of character would
ruin me. Constantly incurring the chance of being
discovered as the Mrs. Slingsby of former years&mdash;certain
to be recognised as the Mrs. Fitzhardinge
who was arrested on suspicion of being concerned
in the murder of the old miser&mdash;and having evidently
entered into some intrigue which has brought
her under the notice of the Marquis of Delmour,
she can no longer be allowed to associate with me!
<em>Her</em> day has gone by&mdash;<em>mine</em> has scarcely begun.”</p>

<p>Laura&mdash;the beauteous, wanton,unprincipled Laura&mdash;had
reached this point in her musings, when she
was startled by an unusually violent ringing at the
front door bell; and in a few moments a gentleman
burst into the room, his impatience having urged
him to cast away all ceremony and dispense with
the introductory agency of Rosalie, who had uttered
an ejaculation of surprise on beholding him.</p>

<p>“Captain Barthelma!” cried Laura, in an astonishment
which even surpassed that of her abigail.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;my angel: It is I!” exclaimed the enthusiastic
young Italian, as, bounding towards Laura,
he caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>His lips were instantaneously fastened to her
ripe mouth; and, remembering the night of love
and pleasure which she had passed with him, she
experienced no vexation at his sudden and most
unexpected appearance.</p>

<p>“Can you pardon me for this intrusion?” he demanded,
at length loosening her from his embrace,
but seating himself closely by her side on the ottoman
and taking her hands in his own; “can you
pardon me, I ask, adorable woman?” he repeated,
gazing upon her in boundless and passionate admiration.</p>

<p>“It seems that it were useless to be offended
with you,” she replied, smiling with voluptuous
sweetness.</p>

<p>“Oh! then you will not upbraid me&mdash;you will
not reproach me with having broken the solemn
promise that I made you to depart and seek to see
you no more in Paris?” he exclaimed. “But even
if you were inclined to be angry, Laura, it could not
in justice be upon me that your wrath would fall.
You must blame your own matchless beauty&mdash;you
must take all the fault unto yourself. I feel that I
cannot live without you. Ever since we parted, my
brain has been in a ceaseless ferment&mdash;my soul a
prey to incessant excitement. By day and by night
has your lovely image been before me: by day and
by night have I fancied that I heard your voice pouring
forth the most eloquent music:&mdash;I have dreamt
that your lips, breathing odours and bathed with
sweets, were pressed to mine:&mdash;and your looks,
beaming love, and happiness, and joy, have ever been
fixed on mine! Oh! my imagination has maintained
me in a condition of such pleasing pain that I have
been in a species of restless elysium,&mdash;a giddy and
sometimes agonising whirl, although the scene was
paradise! At length I could endure this state no
longer: and when at a considerable distance from
Paris, on the road to Italy, I suddenly and secretly
quitted the service of the Grand Duke&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! what madness&mdash;what insanity!” exclaimed
Laura, grieved that the handsome young Castelcicalan
should have made so deep a sacrifice for her&mdash;inasmuch
as his generous devotion had not only
flattered her pride, but also touched her soul.</p>

<p>“It may be madness&mdash;it may be insanity,” repeated
Lorenzo Barthelma, with impassioned warmth:
“but those words must in that case be taken only
as other terms for the deepest&mdash;sincerest&mdash;and most
ardent devotion. Were I a beggar on the face of
the earth, I should have acted in the same manner;
because I should have come to you&mdash;I should have
thrown myself at your feet&mdash;I should have implored
you to render me happy,&mdash;and in return I should
have toiled from morning to night to make up for
the deficiency of my means.”</p>

<p>“Generous Lorenzo!” exclaimed Laura, speaking
with more sincerity than had characterised her
words for years.</p>

<p>“Ah! then you are somewhat touched by my
devotion, angelic woman!” cried the handsome
young officer, drawing her still more closely towards
him, and passing his arm round her slender
waist. “But happily I am no pauper&mdash;fortunately
I am <em>not</em> dependent upon my own exertions.
When I was with you before, my adorable Laura, I
told you that I possessed a competency; and I then
offered to link my destinies with yours for ever.
Now my circumstances have materially altered&mdash;and
I rejoice in the fact! For the French papers
of this day contain intelligence of the death of my
cousin, the Count of Carignano, at Montoni; and
by that unexpected event I have succeeded alike to
his title and his princely revenues.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my beloved Lorenzo,” exclaimed Laura,
now giving way to all that tenderness towards him
which was really in accordance with her inclinations,
but which her more selfish interests would
have prompted her to subdue and stifle had not this
last announcement met her ear: “Oh! my beloved
Lorenzo,” she cried, pressing closer to him, so that
he could feel her bosom throbbing like the undulations
of a mighty tide&mdash;for she was now powerfully
excited, alike morally and sensually: “how can I
reward&mdash;how recompense this generosity on your
part?”</p>

<p>“By becoming my wife&mdash;yes, my wife, Laura&mdash;if
you will,” returned the enraptured young man.
“For you know not how I love you&mdash;how intense
is the passion with which you have inspired me. I
am blind and deaf to all&mdash;everything, save your
beauties and your witching voice. If you be the
greatest profligate the world ever saw, I care not&mdash;so
madly do I love you.”</p>

<p>“And when this delirium shall have passed
away, Lorenzo,” murmured Laura, concealing her
burning countenance on his breast, “you will repent
the rashness which induced you to wed with one
who had so easily abandoned herself to you when a
complete stranger&mdash;and whom&mdash;whom&mdash;you knew
to be unchaste even then!” she added, her voice
becoming touchingly low and tremulously plaintive.</p>

<p>“To suspect even for an instant that I should
ever repent of making you my wife, Laura, is to
doubt my love,” said the Count of Carignano&mdash;for
such we may now call him; “and <em>that</em> wounds me
to the very soul! ’Tis sufficient for me to know
that you are an angel of beauty&mdash;and I reck not if
you are a demoness in character. But <em>that</em> I am
sure is impossible. Your loveliness may have led
you into temptations, and your temperament may
have induced you to yield: but that you are generous&mdash;good&mdash;amiable,
I am convinced, Laura;&mdash;and
that you will prove faithful to one who places all
his own happiness in you, and who will study incessantly
to promote yours&mdash;oh! of that I am well
assured also. Say, then, my adored one&mdash;can you
consent to become the Countess of Carignano, with
a revenue of twelve thousand a year?”</p>

<p>“Not for the dross&mdash;oh! not for the despicable
dross,” murmured Laura, scarcely able to restrain
her joy within reasonable bounds, and induce her
suitor to believe that no selfish interests were mixed
up with the motives for that assent which she was
about to give,&mdash;“not for vile and sordid gold, Lorenzo,
do I respond in the affirmative to the generous proposal
that you have now made to me&mdash;because I
myself am possessed of a fortune of sixty thousand
pounds: but it is because I love you&mdash;yes&mdash;I love
you, my handsome Lorenzo&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say no more, Laura&mdash;beloved Laura!” interrupted
the impassioned young nobleman, straining
her to his breast: then fondly&mdash;oh! how fondly did
he gaze upon her&mdash;upon <em>her</em>, that guileful woman&mdash;reading
the reflection of his own voluptuous feelings
in her fine large eyes, and then bestowing upon
her the most ardent caresses.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed away,&mdash;minutes that
glided by with rapid and silent wings;&mdash;and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
handsome pair scarcely noticed that a single second
had elapsed since last they spoke.</p>

<p>“Tell me, my sweet Laura,” at length said the
Count, toying with the glossy and fragrant tresses
of her hair,&mdash;“tell me what meant certain words
which you addressed to me on that evening when I
was first blessed with your kindness. You declared
that you could not marry me, although you
were not married&mdash;that you could not be my mistress,
although you were not the mistress of another&mdash;and
that you could not hold out any hope to me,
although you were pledged to no other man.”</p>

<p>“That language, apparently so mysterious, is easily
explained,” said Laura, forcing a deep blush into
her cheeks as she spoke, and winding one of her
snow-white and naked arms round her lover’s neck,
so that the contact of the firm warm flesh against
his cheek sent the blood rushing through his veins
in boiling currents. “I had abandoned myself to
you in a moment of caprice&mdash;no, of weakness&mdash;of
passion, which I could not subdue: I had yielded
to an invincible impulse, not knowing its nature,
and not waiting to ask myself the question. But
when you had been with me a short time, I felt that
I could love you&mdash;yes&mdash;deeply, tenderly love you;
and as I fancied that, even though you protested
the contrary, you could entertain no lasting affection
for me, but on the other hand would soon regret
any hastily and rashly-formed connexion, I was resolved
not to place my own heart in jeopardy, nor
incur the risk of loving well and then sustaining a
cruel disappointment. For I feared that you addressed
me in an impassioned tone only because
you were labouring under the delirium of passing
excitement and strong though evanescent feelings.
Thus was it, then&mdash;for my own sake&mdash;that I spoke
mysteriously to you, in order to convince you of the
necessity of seeing me no more. But now, my
Lorenzo&mdash;now, that you have had several days to
reflect upon the proposal which you then made me&mdash;now
that I have received such unequivocal proofs
of your love, and that I no longer fear lest you
should be acting in obedience to a sudden impulse,&mdash;oh!
now, I say, I can hesitate no longer&mdash;and I
will become your wife!”</p>

<p>The Count of Carignano drank in the delicious
poison of her words until his very soul was intoxicated;
and loving so well as did this generous-hearted,
confiding young man, he paused not for an
instant to demand of himself whether he were loving
wisely. But he was contented to risk all and everything,&mdash;happiness&mdash;honour&mdash;fame&mdash;and
name,&mdash;in
this marriage upon which he had set his mind:&mdash;he
longed&mdash;he burnt&mdash;he craved to possess Laura altogether&mdash;to
have her to himself;&mdash;and he felt jealous
of all the rest of the world until the nuptial knot
should have been tied. It is in this humour and in
such a temperament that the highest peer will
marry an actress, who would jump at an offer to
become his pensioned mistress for a few hundreds
a-year.</p>

<p>And Laura&mdash;what was passing in her mind? The
readers may easily conceive: and yet, lest there
should be one or two of imaginations so opaque as
not to be able to divine her thoughts, we will describe
them as succinctly as possible.</p>

<p>She had run down the institution of marriage
when in conversation with the Marquis of Delmour,
because she knew that he was already bound in
matrimonial bonds, and that <em>she</em> therefore could
not become his wife. The result was that she was
enabled to consent to become his mistress with
much less apparent violation of decency, and without
the risk of shocking his feelings. And his
mistress she would have become, as she indeed promised,
had not the arrival of the Count of Carignano
turned her thoughts into an entirely new channel,
and placed her interests altogether in a new light.
From the moment that he announced his title and his
wealth, Laura resolved to throw the poor Marquis
of Delmour overboard and accept the proposals of
the Italian nobleman.</p>

<p>In fact, Fortune appeared to favour Laura marvellously.
Ere now she had beholden a coronet at
the end of a vista of some years: in her musings, she
had said, “The Marquis will be worth two hundred
thousand pounds to me: and <em>then</em> I may espouse a
peer of high title!” Such was her ambitious speculation
previously to the arrival of Lorenzo: and
now, since he had come, she no longer need pass
through the apprenticeship of mistress to one nobleman
in order to become the wife of another. No&mdash;a
coronet was within her grasp: a few days&mdash;a few
hours might behold her Countess of Carignano,&mdash;with
a husband of whom she could not but be
proud, and not with an animated corpse bound to
her side.</p>

<p>Here was another triumph for Laura&mdash;another
cause of glorification in the possession of those
matchless charms which thus captivated so hastily
and triumphed so effectually. Within a few short
weeks she had seen Charles Hatfield&mdash;the Marquis
of Delmour&mdash;and the Count of Carignano at her
feet. The first and last had enjoyed her favours:
the second was in anticipation of them&mdash;and, in that
anticipation, had paid sixty thousand pounds. To
the first she was wedded&mdash;and their marriage was
a secret: to the last she had consented to be allied&mdash;and
their union would be proclaimed to all the
world!</p>

<p>Oh! associated with all these reflections, were
triumphs&mdash;glorious triumphs for Laura Mortimer;
and as those thoughts rushed through her mind, as
she lay half embraced in the arms of the fond and
doting Italian nobleman, the delicious rosiness of
animation spread over her cheeks, and kindred fires
flashed from under her long silken lashes.</p>

<p>“How beautiful art thou, my adored one!” exclaimed
Carignano, as he contemplated the glorious
loveliness of her looks: and then he pressed his
lips to that mouth which was so voluptuously
formed, and which rather resembled a luscious fruit
than anything belonging to human shape. “Oh!
how I long to call thee mine&mdash;to know that thou
art indissolubly linked to me! But say&mdash;tell me&mdash;when
shall this happy, happy union take place?&mdash;when
wilt thou accompany me to the altar?”</p>

<p>“Let us depart for England without delay, my
dearest Lorenzo,” murmured Laura, lavishing upon
him the most tender caresses; “and there&mdash;in
London&mdash;our marriage can be celebrated immediately
after our arrival. Have you any tie&mdash;and
business on hand to retain you in Paris?”</p>

<p>“None in the world,” was the answer: “and
even if I had, everything should give place to the
accomplishment of my felicity and the fulfilment of
your wishes.”</p>

<p>“Then let us take our departure as early as convenient
to-morrow morning,” said Laura.</p>

<p>“And we shall not separate in the meantime?”
observed the young Count, straining the syren to
his breast.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p>She murmured a favourable reply; and, after
some minutes of tender dalliance, she hastened to
give her servants the necessary instructions relative
to the preparations for her departure.</p>

<p>A delicate supper was then served up; and the
sparkling champagne made the eyes of the lovers
flash more brightly, and enhanced the rich carnation
glow of their countenances.</p>

<p>The time-piece struck eleven; and they were
about to retire to rest, when Rosalie hastily entered
the room, and approaching Laura, said in an
under tone, “<em>Mademoiselle</em>, your mother has this
moment arrived. I told her that you were engaged&mdash;and
she awaits your presence in the breakfast-parlour.”</p>

<p>“It is my mother, dear Lorenzo,” Laura observed
to the Count, who had not overheard the abigail’s
communication: “but her arrival will not in any
way interfere with our arrangements,” she hastened
to add, perceiving that the young nobleman’s
countenance suddenly expressed apprehension.</p>

<p>“And yet you yourself appear to be but little
pleased at this occurrence, dearest Laura,” he whispered,
gazing fondly upon her.</p>

<p>“I could have wished it were otherwise,” she
responded: “but no matter. There is nothing to
fear: I am independent of my mother. Have
patience for ten minutes&mdash;and I will return to
you.”</p>

<p>With these words, she pressed his hand tenderly
and then hurried from the apartment&mdash;the discreet
Rosalie having already retired the moment she had
delivered her message.</p>

<p>Laura hastened to the breakfast-parlour; and
there she found her mother, whose garments indicated
that she had just arrived in Paris after a
journey in an open vehicle and on a dusty road.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXXIV">CHAPTER CLXXXIV.<br />

<span class="medium">LAURA AND HER MOTHER.&mdash;ANOTHER INTERRUPTION.</span></h2>

<p>“Here I am in Paris once more, Perdita&mdash;Laura,
I mean,” said the old woman, without moving from
the seat which she had taken, and without offering
to embrace her daughter; “and I am within the
fortnight stipulated, too.”</p>

<p>“You have travelled post from Calais or Boulogne,
doubtless?” observed Laura, interrogatively:
“for your clothes are covered with dust&mdash;and it is
evident that you were not cooped up in the interior
of a diligence. I may therefore conclude that you
were successful in your search after Torrens and
your designs upon him,” she added, fixing a penetrating
glance upon her mother’s countenance.</p>

<p>“I was so far successful that I obtained certain
intelligence concerning him,” responded the old
woman: “but I failed altogether in my hope of becoming
the possessor of his money.”</p>

<p>“And what was the intelligence to which you
allude?” demanded Laura, who felt convinced from
her mother’s manner that she had <em>not</em> failed in the
object of her journey.</p>

<p>“I learnt, beyond all question or doubt, that
Torrens really was the murderer of Percival, but
that he himself had met with a violent death.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Torrens is no more?” exclaimed Laura:
then, bending a look full of deep meaning upon her
mother, she said in a tone of equal significancy,
“You went to London to be revenged upon him&mdash;and
he is dead! He has experienced a violent end.
Well&mdash;I understand you&mdash;I read your secret&mdash;and
you need not be more explicit.”</p>

<p>“By heaven! you wrong me, Laura,” exclaimed
the old woman, starting in astonishment and alarm
as the justice of her daughter’s horrible suspicion
became suddenly apparent&mdash;a suspicion that she
herself had so incautiously engendered by the mysterious
manner in which she had announced Torrens’
death.</p>

<p>“It is not worth while disputing upon the subject,”
said Laura, in a tone which convinced her
mother&mdash;and, indeed, was intended to convince her,
that no explanation could now possibly wipe away
the suspicion alluded to. “You are doubtless well
pleased that Torrens is no more&mdash;and that is sufficient.”</p>

<p>“Perdita&mdash;Laura, I mean,” said the old woman,
speaking as if her tongue were parched, or as if
ashes clogged up her throat, “why should you take
delight in uttering things to vex and annoy me?
For some time past&mdash;indeed ever since the date of
your connection with Charles Hatfield, a barrier
has appeared to rise up between us. We seem to
act towards each other as if it were tacitly understood
that we are enemies, or that we mutually
harboured distrust and suspicion.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of it, mother&mdash;and it is all your
own fault,” answered Laura. “You sought to exercise
over me a sway to which I would not and
never will submit; and you menaced me in a manner
not easily to be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“But you had your revenge&mdash;for you abused me
vilely,” retorted Mrs. Mortimer, with a malignant
bitterness of accent.</p>

<p>“Acknowledged! And you yourself must admit
that you provoked my resentment. But let us not
remain here bandying words, which may only lead
to an useless quarrel. Circumstances have opened
to me a grand career&mdash;a career, in which my happiness
and my interests may be alike promoted; and
I have accepted the destiny thus favourably prepared
for me. In a word, I am about to marry a
young Italian nobleman whom I feel I can love&mdash;whom
I already love, indeed&mdash;and who possesses a
proud title and princely revenues.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you are about to be married?” said Mrs.
Mortimer, speaking as if the project were perfectly
natural and without an objection: but in her heart&mdash;in
the depths of her foul and vindictive soul, she
was rejoiced,&mdash;for this alliance would place her
daughter completely in her power.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that the old woman
was aware of Laura’s union with Charles Hatfield,
but that the young lady herself was totally unsuspicious
of that fact being thus known to her
mother.</p>

<p>“Yes,” resumed Laura: “I am about to be married.
I leave Paris for England to-morrow morning.
I return to London, because I am now independent
of the Hatfields; and at my leisure I shall devise
means to avenge myself for the insults I have received
at their hands. It now remains for you and
me to decide upon what terms we are to exist in
future. Be friendly&mdash;and I shall allow you a handsome
income: be hostile&mdash;and I shall dare all you
can do against me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that my daughter should think it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
necessary to propose such alternatives,” said Mrs.
Mortimer. “State what you require me to do.”</p>

<p>“To settle in France&mdash;wherever you please,” responded
Laura; “and I will grant you an allowance
of two hundred pounds every three
months.”</p>

<p>“The pecuniary portion of the conditions is liberal
enough,” said Mrs. Mortimer; “but the rest is as
despotic and galling as the terms which Mr. Hatfield
made the other day with you.”</p>

<p>“I much regret that prudence should compel me
thus to dictate to you,” returned Laura: “there is,
however, no alternative. ’Tis for you to yield to
my conditions&mdash;or open war will at once commence
between us.”</p>

<p>“I consent&mdash;I agree,” said the old woman, who
knew that the time was not yet come for her to
show her teeth in defiance of her daughter.</p>

<p>“So much the better!” exclaimed Laura, but
in a tone indicating that the matter was one of
perfect indifference to her; for she little knew&mdash;little
suspected how irretrievably her marriage with
the Count of Carignano would place her in her
mother’s power. “And now I have one question
to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Speak, Perdita,” observed the old woman.</p>

<p>“Pray remember that my name is <em>Laura</em>!” cried
her daughter, petulantly. “You perceive how
necessary it is that we should dwell apart from
each other. Your imprudence is really great; and the
question I am about to put to you, refers to some
matter in which you doubtless compromised yourself.
Are you acquainted with the Marquis of
Delmour?”</p>

<p>“The Marquis of Delmour!” repeated Mrs.
Mortimer, with an expression of countenance denoting
the most unfeigned astonishment. “No&mdash;certainly
not. I have heard of him, it is true; but
only in the same way that one hears of any other
person conspicuous for rank, wealth, or station.
I have never seen the Marquis of Delmour to my
knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have been in his company without
knowing who he was,” resumed Laura. “At
all events, have you recently represented yourself,
in any circle or place, as the widow of a General-officer
whom you stated to have died in India?”</p>

<p>The system of duplicity which the old woman
determined to adopt towards her daughter, had so
well prepared her to sustain any questioning or
cross-examination on any point, that she did not
betray the least surprise, nor did her countenance
undergo the slightest change as that interrogatory
suddenly brought to her mind the conviction that
Mr. Vernon and the Marquis of Delmour must be
one and the same person. Without at the moment
perceiving how this discovery could be in any way
useful to her, but still acting with that reserve and
wariness with which she had armed herself in order
to meet her daughter, she resolved not to mention
a single word of anything that had occurred in London
relative to the beautiful Recluse of the Cottage,
her father, and Lord William Trevelyan.</p>

<p>Accordingly, and without the least hesitation,&mdash;nor
quailing, nor changing colour beneath the penetrating
gaze which Laura fixed upon her,&mdash;she said,
“I do not remember ever to have made any such
representation as that to which you allude.”</p>

<p>“It is singular&mdash;this coincidence,” mused Laura,
audibly; “and yet it is of little import to me.”</p>

<p>“It would appear, at all events, that you must be
acquainted with this Marquis of Delmour of whom
you speak?” said Mrs. Mortimer, in a careless and
indifferent tone.</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words uttered, when a violent
ringing at the front door was heard; and in a few
moments a voice, instantly recognised alike by
Laura and her mother, exclaimed to Rosalie, “Has
your mistress retired to rest yet? I must see her
immediately.”</p>

<p>The abigail, suspecting that it would be better
not to allow the Marquis of Delmour&mdash;for he the
visitor was&mdash;to be brought face to face with the
handsome young Italian, unhesitatingly conducted
the nobleman into the parlour where Laura and Mrs.
Mortimer were holding their interview.</p>

<p>But the moment Rosalie had closed the door
behind the Marquis, he uttered an ejaculation of
mingled astonishment and rage, and springing
towards Mrs. Mortimer, exclaimed, “Ah! I meet
you again, vile woman! Give me up my daughter&mdash;tell
me where you have hidden her!”</p>

<p>And he caught her violently by the arm.</p>

<p>“I know what you mean, my lord,” said the old
woman, hastily: “but you accuse me wrongfully.”</p>

<p>“Wrongfully!” repeated the Marquis, his countenance
white with rage: “no&mdash;no! I only
accuse you justly&mdash;for it must be you who have
spirited away my child&mdash;my beloved Agnes!”</p>

<p>“It is false!” ejaculated the old woman, with an
emphasis which made him release his hold of her
and fall back two or three paces.</p>

<p>“False, you say!” he cried. “Oh! then, if you
have really not done this flagrant wrong&mdash;but if you
are in possession of any clue&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am&mdash;I am,” interrupted Mrs. Mortimer, seeing
in a moment that a reward was to be obtained and
her spite against Lord William Trevelyan to be
gratified at the same time: for she <em>did</em> cherish the
bitterest animosity against that young nobleman,
on account of his conduct towards her when, four
days previously, she had taken Agnes Vernon to
his house in Park Square.</p>

<p>“And yet I cannot conceive you to be innocent
in this matter,” exclaimed the nobleman, surveying
her with deep distrust and aversion&mdash;and all this
time taking no notice of Laura, so profoundly were
his feelings engrossed by the subject which now
occupied his mind: “for wherefore did you visit
the cottage where Agnes dwelt?&mdash;why did you
intrude yourself upon her presence?”</p>

<p>“All that can be readily explained, my lord,”
responded Mrs. Mortimer, not losing an atom of
her self-possession.</p>

<p>“Then tell me where my daughter is&mdash;tell me
what has become of her?” cried the nobleman, in
an appealing tone; “and if you have been concerned
in removing her from the cottage, I will
forgive you! Nay, more&mdash;I will reward you handsomely.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter is in safety&mdash;that much I can
inform you at once,” said Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Thanks&mdash;thanks for this assurance!” cried the
old nobleman, clasping his hands together in gratitude
for the relief thus imparted to his mind: then,
suddenly recollecting the presence of Laura, he
turned towards her, and in a tone of mingled suspicion
and reproach, said, “But how is it that I
find you with the very person of whom I spoke to
you somewhat disparagingly two short hours ago?”</p>

<p>“She claims some distant relationship with me,
my dear Marquis,” Laura hastened to observe&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
without manifesting the slightest embarrassment;
while the rapid and intelligent sign which she made
to her mother, and which was altogether unperceived
by the nobleman, was fully understood by
the old woman.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is on account of her name being <em>Mortimer</em>,”
said the Marquis, completely satisfied by the
answer which Laura had given him&mdash;especially as
the old woman offered no contradiction. “And
now I must request you to accede to some alteration
in our plans for to-morrow,” he continued,
drawing Laura aside, and speaking to her in a low
tone. “On my return just now to the hotel where
I am staying, I found a letter containing the afflicting
intelligence that a daughter of mine&mdash;a
daughter whom circumstances have compelled me
to keep in the strictest seclusion&mdash;had suddenly
and most mysteriously disappeared from her dwelling
in the neighbourhood of London. This happened
five days ago;&mdash;but Mrs. Gifford&mdash;my dear
child’s housekeeper, and I may almost say <em>guardian</em>&mdash;did
not immediately write to me, hoping that
Agnes would return. Oh! you may conceive how
deeply this event has grieved me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I sympathise sincerely with you, my dear Marquis,”
interrupted Laura, affecting to wipe away
tears from her eyes: for it suited her purpose to
remain on good terms with the old nobleman until
she should have cashed her draft for the sixty
thousand pounds. “Yes&mdash;I sincerely sympathise
with you,” she repeated: “and I can anticipate the
proposed alterations in our arrangements. You intend
to start immediately for England&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Without a moment’s unnecessary delay,” said
the Marquis, who was greatly excited by the intelligence
he had received from Mrs. Gifford: “the instant
I return to my hotel, a post-chaise and four
will be in readiness for me. But may I hope that
you will follow me to London as speedily as convenient?”</p>

<p>“I shall depart to-morrow, my dear Marquis, at
the hour already arranged,” responded Laura; “and
deeply do I regret that my preparations are so
backward as to render it impossible for me to offer
to become your travelling-companion at once.”</p>

<p>“Dearest Laura!” murmured the Marquis, for a
single moment losing the remembrance of his affliction
in the doting passion he had formed for the
beautiful woman who was thus grossly deluding
him. “Our separation will not be very long,” he
continued; “and I hope that when we meet in
London three days hence, I may have good news to
tell you respecting Agnes. Now, madam,” he exclaimed
aloud, turning towards Mrs. Mortimer,
who, while affecting to be examining the mantel-ornaments,
was vainly endeavouring to catch the
sense of what was passing at a little distance between
her daughter and the Marquis; “now,
madam,” he said, approaching her with an abruptness
that made her start, “I do not think I shall
be insulting you if I offer you a hundred guineas
for the information which you professed yourself
able and willing to give relative to my daughter&mdash;my
dear and well-beloved Agnes.”</p>

<p>“A hundred guineas, my lord!” exclaimed Mrs.
Mortimer, contemptuously: “if you really love
that young lady whom you call your daughter, you
must surely consider that it is worth five or six
times the amount named in order to regain possession
of her.”</p>

<p>“Laura dearest:&mdash;&mdash;I mean, Miss Mortimer,” said
the nobleman, impatiently, as he turned towards
the young lady,&mdash;“oblige me with writing materials,
and I will speedily satisfy this woman’s rapacity.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I might also exact a recompense for
keeping secret the good understanding which exists
between your lordship and ‘<em>dearest Laura</em>,’
and which you so unguardedly betrayed?” observed
Mrs. Mortimer, in a tone of bitter sarcasm, and
with a malignant glance darted from her snake-like
eyes at her daughter.</p>

<p>“Silence, woman!” ejaculated the Marquis,
speaking with the emphasis of authority: then,
the writing materials being now placed before
him, he sate down and wrote a cheque, which he
tossed across the table to Mrs. Mortimer, saying,
“I am sorry that I have not enough money about
my person to satisfy your demands. I am therefore
compelled to give you a draft upon my London
bankers; and you will perceive that it is for <em>six
times</em> as much as I at first offered you,” he added,
dwelling on the words which the old woman had
herself used to indicate the amount of her expectations.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;my lord: I see that it is for six hundred
pounds,” she observed, coolly and quietly, as she
folded up the cheque and secured it about her person.
“And now I will tell you what I know concerning
your daughter; and I take heaven to witness
that I will not mislead you.”</p>

<p>“If you do, my good woman,” interrupted the
Marquis, “you will find payment of the cheque
stopped at the bank. Go on; and delay not&mdash;for
my time is precious.”</p>

<p>“In a word, my lord,” said Mrs. Mortimer, the
contemptuous manner in which she was treated by
the haughty peer being fully counterbalanced by
the handsome bonus that had just fallen into her
hand,&mdash;“Lord William Trevelyan, whom you doubtless
know well by name, if not personally, is deeply
enamoured of your daughter; and he employed me
to take a letter to her. I acquitted myself of the
task: but Miss Agnes is a perfect dragon of virtue&mdash;and
I could make little impression upon her.”</p>

<p>“God be thanked!” ejaculated the Marquis, fervently.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;although Lord William’s passion is
honourable enough, I have no doubt, yet Miss
Agnes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And is it Lord William who has taken her
away?” demanded the Marquis, unable to restrain
his impatience or any longer endure the tortures of
suspense.</p>

<p>“No, my lord&mdash;it was her mother!” said Mrs.
Mortimer, watching through profound curiosity the
effect which this announcement would produce
upon the nobleman.</p>

<p>“Ah! then my worst apprehensions are confirmed!”
he exclaimed, in a tone of poignant anguish.</p>

<p>“But do not give way to despair, my lord,” said
Mrs. Mortimer: “for Miss Agnes subsequently
escaped from the house where her mother placed
her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! I then she loves me still&mdash;<em>me</em>&mdash;her father!”
exclaimed the Marquis, in accents of joy: “and she
yielded not to the wiles of that woman&mdash;&mdash;But proceed,
madam&mdash;proceed!” he cried, suddenly interrupting
himself, and again speaking in a tone of
impatience.</p>

<p>“Having escaped, as I have just said,” resumed
Mrs. Mortimer, “Agnes fell into the power of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
ruffian, from whose hands I was fortunate enough
to rescue her; and, not knowing precisely whither
to take her, I thought it best to consult Lord William
Trevelyan upon the proper course to adopt.
His lordship, who is a man of honour&mdash;and pray
remember to tell him that I say so,” she added, with
a slight accent of malignity,&mdash;“his lordship immediately
placed her in the care of a lady of his
acquaintance; and it is to him that you must apply,
my Lord Marquis, for the address of your daughter’s
new abode.”</p>

<p>“And all that you have told me is true?” exclaimed
the old nobleman.</p>

<p>“If it should prove otherwise, your lordship has
in your own hands the means of punishing me,”
responded Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“True!” cried the Marquis; “and now I am
somewhat consoled by the tidings you have given
me. My daughter is safe, and in the society of
honourable persons. I thank you, madam.”</p>

<p>He then turned away to shake Laura cordially by
the hand ere he took his departure.</p>

<p>“You will leave to-morrow at mid-day, dearest,”
he said, in an under tone to her whom he fondly
hoped to make his mistress, but who was so grossly
deluding him.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;without fail,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And on your arrival in town you will instantly
send me word at which hotel you take up your
temporary residence?” continued the Marquis. “I
shall hasten to join you, and hope to have a charming
villa ready to receive you.”</p>

<p>“You are too good, my dear Marquis, to think to
much of me at a time when your heart is so severely
lacerated on account of your daughter,” said Laura,
likewise speaking in a whisper.</p>

<p>“There is nothing that I would not do for you,
beloved Laura,” responded the infatuated old noble.
“You hold already a cheque for sixty thousand
pounds: that is nothing to what I will do for you,
my dearest angel. And if I allude to pecuniary
affairs at all, it is to convince you how anxious I am
to ensure your happiness, not only now&mdash;but likewise
when I shall be no more.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the Marquis of Delmour pressed
Laura’s hand fervently, and was about to hurry
away, when, suddenly recollecting something, he
drew her still farther aside, and said in a very low
whisper, “Have nothing to do with that woman
dearest! I dislike her looks&mdash;I mistrust her altogether.
She is evidently an adventuress. Oh! how
could I have ever supposed even for an instant that
such a wretch was the mother of such an angelic
being as my Laura?”</p>

<p>Another fond and impassioned look&mdash;another
pressure of the hand&mdash;and the Marquis was gone.</p>

<p>Of all this latter dialogue which took place between
that nobleman and Laura, and which was
carried on in a very low tone, Mrs. Mortimer, who
strained all her auricular faculties to catch even a
syllable, succeeded only in overhearing a very short
sentence. But that one sentence she did manage
to catch; and a highly significant as well as deeply
important one was it for her.</p>

<p>And these were the words which she thus
caught&mdash;“<em>You hold already a cheque for sixty
thousand pounds!</em>”</p>

<p>Quickly as the first glass of sparkling wine infuses
a delicious sensation throughout the entire
frame,&mdash;so speedily did that one sentence create a
burning joy in the breast of the old woman. She
saw through it all:&mdash;Laura had wheedled the Marquis
out of that immense sum&mdash;and now she intended
to jilt him, and espouse the Italian noble!</p>

<p>“A cheque for sixty thousand pounds!” thought
Mrs. Mortimer within herself, while the Marquis
and Laura were still whispering together: “sixty
thousand pounds! Well&mdash;we shall see! It is
better than a paltry six hundred.”</p>

<p>And, while thus musing, she affected to be
smelling the flowers on the mantel-piece, until the
door suddenly opened and closed again instantaneously&mdash;and
then she turned round towards Laura,
for the Marquis was gone.</p>

<p>“And you assured me that you knew nothing of
the nobleman who has just left us?” said Laura,
fixing her eyes with cold contempt on her mother.</p>

<p>“I knew him only as Mr. Vernon until I saw him
here this evening,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“But it was to him that you had passed yourself as
the widow of a General-officer in the Indian army,”
persisted Laura: “and yet you denied having ever
made such a representation to any one. You perceive,
mother, that I cannot trust you: you are full
of duplicity and deceit even to me&mdash;and still you
complain that a coolness subsists between us.”</p>

<p>“I may observe, on my side, Laura,” retorted the
old woman, with a subdued and cunning malignity,
“that you were not more communicative to
me relative to the Marquis of Delmour than I was
disposed to be to you. We are therefore even upon
that score; and, at all events, let us not dispute.
I shall now leave you, Laura&mdash;for I am well aware
that my room will be preferable to my company.
It is my present intention to remain in Paris; and
from time to time I will send you tidings of my
whereabouts, so that you may duly remit me my
quarterly income, as promised just now. The cheque
of the Marquis I shall send through the medium of
some Parisian banker.”</p>

<p>The old woman then took her departure, a cool
“Good-bye” being all the farewell salutation that
passed between her daughter and herself as she
crossed the threshold of the handsome suite of apartments.</p>

<p>“Thank God! she is gone!” thought Laura, as
she hastened to rejoin her handsome Castelcicalan,
who was growing impatient of her protracted absence.</p>

<p>“The haughty and self-sufficient creature!” murmured
Mrs. Mortimer to herself, an she hastily
descended the stairs: “she is completely in my
power&mdash;at my mercy&mdash;in every way!”</p>

<p>And did the old woman remain in Paris in fulfilment
of her declared intention?</p>

<p>No:&mdash;wearied and exhausted by travel as she already
was, but animated with an indomitable energy,
Mrs. Mortimer hastened, late though the hour now
was, to procure a post-chaise and four; and while
Laura was passing a night of voluptuousness
and love in the arms of the handsome Count of

<span class="medium">THE LAWYER’S HEAD CLERK.</span></h2>

<p>It was about four o’clock in the afternoon of the
day following the incidents just related, that Mr.
James Heathcote, the lawyer, was seated at his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
writing-table in that private office which we have
already described to our readers,&mdash;when a low,
timid knock at the door fell upon his ears.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he exclaimed, in his short, abrupt,
and almost brutal manner, well knowing that the
individual about to enter was the poor wretch
whom he bullied when in an ill-humour, and whom
on all occasions he was wont to make his vile agent
and spaniel-like slave.</p>

<p>Creeping up as usual&mdash;rather than walking with
the natural dignity of a man&mdash;towards the table,
Mr. Green bowed humbly and waited until his
dreaded, but also hated master should deign to give
him leave to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Green,” said Heathcote, after a pause
of a few minutes, during which he waited to see
whether his grovelling serf would dare to open his
lips until he received permission,&mdash;for the lawyer
was a man who liked to ascertain the full extent
of the power that he wielded over his subordinates,
and also to make <em>them</em> feel that he <em>did</em> exercise
that power;&mdash;“well, Mr. Green, what news this
afternoon?”</p>

<p>And, throwing himself back in his arm-chair,
he passed his thin, yellow hand through his iron-grey
hair.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir, I have several things to report,
as you were so much engaged this morning
that you could not give the time to hear me,” observed
Green, in that subdued and almost affrighted
tone of voice which years of servility had rendered
habitual to him;&mdash;for such is ever the case with
those who mistake the most abasing sycophancy
for proofs of respect. And here we may observe
that it is only in the demoralising and degrading
influence of Royal Courts that this disgusting
susurration is adopted as a species of homage to
the divinity raised up by man’s stupid and most reprehensible
idolatry.</p>

<p>“Ah! I recollect&mdash;I was busy this morning,”
exclaimed Mr. Heathcote. “Well&mdash;what have you
to report?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” resumed the trembling clerk,
“Gregson the upholsterer has put his affairs into
the hands of Goodman and Meanwell, who have
got all his creditors save yourself, sir, to sign a
letter of license; and Mr. Goodman has been here
this afternoon to say that unless you will give your
name also, his client must inevitably go into the
<cite>Gazette</cite>.”</p>

<p>“Then let him go&mdash;and to the devil also, if he
chooses!” vociferated Mr. Heathcote, flying into a
passion&mdash;a most unusual thing with one so cool,
calculating, and self-possessed as he. “Goodman
and Meanwell are what are called <em>honest attorneys</em>&mdash;conscientious
lawyers&mdash;straightforward practitioners;&mdash;and
they will exert all their energies to
carry their client through his difficulties. But I
will thwart them, Mr. Green&mdash;by God! I will
thwart them; Gregson <em>shall</em> go into the <cite>Gazette</cite>&mdash;even
if I lose every penny he owes me. I <em>hate</em> your
honest attorneys;”&mdash;and his lips were curled in
bitter irony and demoniac malignity. “Go on,
sir!” he exclaimed savagely, as if it were his
wretched clerk who had irritated him.</p>

<p>“Thompson, sir&mdash;the defendant in Jones’s case,
you know,” resumed Mr. Green, “was arrested yesterday&mdash;in
pursuance of your orders, sir. I took
the liberty of mentioning, sir, that his wife had
just been confined&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?” exclaimed Mr. Heathcote, impatiently.</p>

<p>“And that his eldest child was at the point of
death, sir,” added Green, more timidly than before.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what next?” demanded the attorney.</p>

<p>“The poor child has since died, sir.”</p>

<p>“The poor child, indeed! Who cares a fig about
a child? Why&mdash;you are growing quite soft-hearted,
Mr. Green,” said Heathcote, in a tone of cutting
irony. “The <em>poor</em> child, indeed! I suppose the
wife has died also?” he added, with heartless jocularity.</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I am sorry to say you are right in
your conjecture,” responded Green, scarcely venturing
to make the announcement.</p>

<p>“No!&mdash;is it really the case, though?” exclaimed
Heathcote, startled for a moment at finding that
what he had said as a brutal jest turned out to be a
solemn and shocking truth. “Well&mdash;what next?”
he demanded, mastering those emotions which he
was ashamed at having betrayed.</p>

<p>“Thompson himself, sir&mdash;driven to despair by
these numerous afflictions&mdash;cut his throat in prison
this afternoon,” added Mr. Green.</p>

<p>“Is this possible?” cried Mr. Heathcote, again
excited to a degree more powerful than the clerk
had ever before observed: but speedily subduing
his feelings, by dint of a strong and almost superhuman
effort&mdash;so sudden and effective was it&mdash;he
said, “Well&mdash;it is not my fault. Maudlin sentimentalists
will perhaps lay his death at my
door&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, sir, that <em>all</em> the three deaths will
be attributed to you,” interrupted Green, with an
affectation of exceeding meekness, while from beneath
his brows he darted a rapid glance of fiend-like
expression at his master&mdash;a glance which
denoted how the man in his secret soul feasted
upon the pangs which now rent the heart of the
attorney.</p>

<p>“I am tough enough to bear everything that
people may say of me, Mr. Green,” observed Heathcote,
in his usually cold tone of irony. “But proceed
with your communications.”</p>

<p>“Beale’s wife, sir, called this morning&mdash;you know
Beale?&mdash;the man you put into Whitecross Street
prison, and whose wife and children have been
starving ever since&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Green,” interrupted Heathcote,
fixing a stern look upon his clerk, “it would appear
that you are purposely entering into minute details
this afternoon in order to annoy me. Of
course I know who Beale <em>is</em>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<em>Was</em>, sir, if you please,” said Green, with difficulty
concealing the savage delight that he took
in thus torturing&mdash;or, at least, endeavouring to
torture, his master.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?” demanded Heathcote,
savagely.</p>

<p>“That Beale died in the infirmary at Whitecross
Street last night, sir,” responded Green, his
tone and manner becoming more abjectly obsequious
in proportion as his internal joy augmented
at the increasing excitement and irritation of his
master.</p>

<p>“The man was doubtless a drunkard, Green,”
observed Heathcote, roughly: “and therefore,
when no longer able to get liquor, the reaction
carried him off.”</p>

<p>“I dare say, sir, that you know best&mdash;and I am
sure you must be right,” returned the clerk, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
a low bow: “but the man’s friends <em>do</em> say that a
more sober, hard-working, and deserving fellow
did not exist.”</p>

<div id="i_329" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_329.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“And therefore I suppose that <em>his</em> death will be
laid at my door!” exclaimed Heathcote, now for
the first time in his life glancing timidly&mdash;almost
appealing, at his clerk, as if to implore him to
devise some excuse or start some palliation that
might ease his troubled conscience.</p>

<p>But Green, whose very obsequiousness and servility
afforded him the means of venting his spite
on his hated master, pretended to take the observation
as an assertion and not an interrogatory, and
replied in a humble tone, “Your foresight and
knowledge of the world, sir, are beyond all dispute;
and, as you say, Beale’s death is certain to be laid
at your door. But of course you are perfectly indifferent
to the tittle-tattle of scandalous tongues.”</p>

<p>Heathcote rose from his seat&mdash;or rather started
from it, and walked rapidly up and down the room
thrice. He felt sorely troubled; for, hardened as
his heart was&mdash;obdurate as his soul had become, he
could not shut out the whispering voice of conscience
which now proclaimed him to be the author
of all the deaths that his clerk had enumerated.
And, while he was racked by these painful convictions,
the thought suddenly flashed to his brain
that Green had displayed a savage delight in detailing
those horrors; and, man of the world as
James Heathcote was, it occurred to him, as a natural
sequence to the suspicion just mentioned, that
his clerk hated and abhorred him.</p>

<p>Acting under the influence of these impressions,
he stopped suddenly short close by the spot where
Green was standing; and he fixed his snake-like
gaze upon the shabbily-dressed, senile-looking,
self-debasing individual, who appeared to be maintaining
his eyes bent timidly and reverentially on
the floor&mdash;as if his master’s emotions were something
too sacred to look upon.</p>

<p>“Green!&mdash;Mr. Green!” exclaimed Heathcote,
laying his hand with such abruptness and also with
such violence upon the grovelling wretch’s shoulder,
that it made him start convulsively&mdash;though he
knew all the while that his master had accosted
him, and was also gazing on him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” cried the clerk, raising his eyes diffidently
toward Heathcote’s countenance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>“Do you conceive that the deaths of those people
can be righteously attributed to me?” demanded the
lawyer, speaking in a low, measured, and solemn
tone, and looking as if he sought to read into the
most secret depths of his clerk’s soul: “do you, I
say, dare to associate any act or deed of mine with
<em>their</em> fate?” he asked, raising his voice, while his
face became terrible to gaze upon.</p>

<p>“Who?&mdash;I, sir!” ejaculated Green, as if in
astonishment at the questions put to him; and his
own countenance assumed such a sinister aspect
that Heathcote surveyed him with increasing suspicion
and distrust.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you!” cried the lawyer, ferociously.
“Now, mark me, Green,” he continued, in a lower
and more composed tone of voice,&mdash;“if you dare to
harbour ill feelings towards me&mdash;if even a scintillation
of such feelings should transpire from your words
or manner, I will crush you as I would a
worm&mdash;I will send you to Newgate&mdash;abandon you
to your fate&mdash;and, if necessary, <em>help</em> to have you
shipped for eternal exile.”</p>

<p>“My God! how have I deserved these implied reproaches&mdash;these
terrible menaces?” demanded
Green, his countenance expressing real alarm, and
his whole frame shivering from head to heel.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have <em>not</em> deserved them&mdash;and in
that case they will serve as a warning,” said Heathcote,
now becoming suddenly calm and imperiously
scornful: “but I think that you <em>did</em> merit all I
have uttered&mdash;and now you know me better, perhaps,
than you knew me before. However, let all
this pass. I do not for an instant suppose that I
possess your affection; but I will guard against the
effects of your hate. Answer me not, sir: you cannot
wipe away the impressions which this afternoon’s
scene has conjured up in my mind. And
now proceed with anything more that you may have
to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Fox, the ironmonger, sir,” resumed Green, in a
more timid and servile tone than ever, and with a
manner so cowed and grovelling that it completely
veiled the strong pantings for revenge and the emotions
of bitter, burning hate which dwelt in the
clerk’s secret soul,&mdash;“Fox, the ironmonger, sir, has
realised all his property and absconded.”</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you to issue execution against his
goods without delay?” demanded Heathcote, angrily.</p>

<p>“I obeyed your commands, sir, as soon as the
usual forms were gone through,” responded Green:
“but in the interval the man, knowing the steps
you were taking against him, sold off everything
and ran away&mdash;no one can tell whither.”</p>

<p>“Then all your intelligence is evil this afternoon,
Mr. Green?” said Heathcote. “What about Mrs.
Sefton?”</p>

<p>“The spy that I set to watch her has reported her
removal from Kentish Town to a house at Bayswater,
sir,” answered Green; “and as she has a
young lady with her&mdash;a Miss Vernon, it appears&mdash;she
does not seem to be busying herself in any way
that might interfere with your interests.”</p>

<p>“But that insolent young nobleman&mdash;that Lord
William Trevelyan?” demanded Heathcote.</p>

<p>“I do not think he is troubling himself any more
in the business, sir,” answered Green.</p>

<p>“Good and well!” ejaculated the attorney.
“These latter tidings constitute something like
an agreeable set-off in respect to all your former
communications. Hah!” he cried, suddenly interrupting
himself, as the clock proclaimed the hour:
“five already! Well, you may go now, Green&mdash;and
see that your spies keep a good look-out upon
the movements of Mrs. Sefton and Lord William
Trevelyan.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir,” was the reply; and the clerk bowed
himself out of the office.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards Mr. Green was wending
his way towards the aristocratic quarters of the
West End; and at length he entered a respectable-looking
public-house in the neighbourhood of Portland
Place.</p>

<p>Having called for some refreshment, he took up the
newspaper to while away the time until the arrival
of the person whom he was expecting: but he could
not settle his thoughts to the perusal of the journal.
He read an article through, from beginning to end;
and, when he reached the termination, he had not
retained a single idea of the subject.</p>

<p>The fact was that the man’s mind was excited
and bewildered by the scene which had taken place
that afternoon with his master. He felt that he
had been trampled upon&mdash;treated with every possible
indignity&mdash;despised, menaced, and almost spit
upon;&mdash;and he was compelled to suffer all&mdash;to bear
everything&mdash;to endure those flagrant wrongs, without
daring to murmur.</p>

<p>“But I will be avenged&mdash;terribly avenged!”
thought he within himself, as he bent over the table
in the public-house parlour, supporting his head
upon his two hands: “yes&mdash;even though I should
sacrifice myself, I will be avenged sooner or later.
For years and years have I been his slave&mdash;his menial&mdash;his
instrument&mdash;his tool;&mdash;and he has kept
me in such utter subjection that it was not until
lately I remembered that I really possessed a soul
and a spirit of my own. The hard-hearted&mdash;cruel&mdash;remorseless
wretch! I hate and abhor him with a
malignant hatred and a savage abhorrence. No
words are strong enough&mdash;no terms sufficiently potent
to convey even to myself an idea of the magnitude
of that aversion which I now entertain for him.
But if he has me in his power in one way, he is at
my mercy in many other others. He little suspects
how deep an insight I possess into his affairs&mdash;his
machinations&mdash;his dark plots. He thinks that I
behold but the surface: he knows not that I have
fathomed to the bottom!”</p>

<p>At this point in the clerk’s musings, the door of
the parlour was opened, and a respectable-looking
man, dressed in black, but with a white cravat
entered the room.</p>

<p>“You are somewhat behind your time, Mr. Fitzgeorge,”
said Green, as this individual&mdash;who was
Lord William Trevelyan’s valet&mdash;seated himself by
the clerk’s side.</p>

<p>“Only a few minutes,” responded Fitzgeorge.
“And now to business without delay. It is fortunate
that we are all alone in this parlour at present:
otherwise I should have proposed to adjourn
to a private room. Have you thought well of the
subject I mentioned to you yesterday?”</p>

<p>“I have,” was the answer, delivered in a tone of
decision: “and I am prepared to meet your wishes.
But remember that I told you how completely I
am in the power of the villain Heathcote; and if he
were to discover that your noble master received
his information through me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He cannot possibly detect your instrumentality
in the business, provided you do not betray yourself,”
said Fitzgeorge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>“Then I cannot hesitate to serve you,” responded
Green.</p>

<p>“Here are a hundred pounds in advance of the
sum promised you,” continued the valet, producing
bank-notes to the amount named; “and the other
moiety shall be paid the moment the information
you are about to give me shall have proved to be
correct.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it is a long&mdash;long time since I could call
so much money my own,” said Green, with a deep
sigh, as he gazed upon the notes&mdash;half doubting
whether it were possible that they were about to
find their way into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Take up the money and use despatch&mdash;for my
time is precious,” exclaimed Fitzgeorge.</p>

<p>The clerk followed the first suggestion with
amazing alacrity; and his sinister countenance was
now as radiant with joy as such a face could be.</p>

<p>“Your master is generous&mdash;very generous,” he
said, as soon as the notes were secured in his waistcoat-pocket;
“and I will serve him to the utmost
of my power. The mad-house to which Sir Gilbert
Heathcote has been consigned, is kept by Dr. Swinton,
and is situated in the neighbourhood of the
new church facing the end of the Bethnal Green
Road.”</p>

<p>“I am well acquainted with the locality,” said
Fitzgeorge. “The church you speak of is in the
Cambridge Road, and stands at one of the angles of
the Green?”</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” answered the clerk; “and the
lunatic asylum looks upon the Green itself, its
back windows commanding a view of Globe Town.
But here is the exact address,” continued the man,
producing a card from his pocket.</p>

<p>“That is all I require,” said Fitzgeorge. “Three
days hence you can meet me here again; and if in
the meantime I should have discovered that Sir
Gilbert Heathcote is really confined in Dr. Swinton’s
asylum, the other hundred pounds shall be
handed over to you.”</p>

<p>The valet and the clerk then separated.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXXVI">CHAPTER CLXXXVI.<br />

<span class="medium">DR. SWINTON.</span></h2>

<p>The mad-house kept by Dr. Swinton was a spacious
building, with a large garden, surrounded by
a high wall, at the back.</p>

<p>It was by no means a gloomy-looking place, although
the casements were protected by iron bars:
for to mitigate that prison-like effect, the curtains
were of a cheerful colour, and the window-sills
were adorned with flowers and verdant evergreens
in bright red pots. Moreover, the front of the house
was stuccoed; and wherever paint was used, the
colours were of the gayest kind.</p>

<p>The front door always stood open during the day-time,
because there was an inner door of great
strength which led into the hall; and a porter in
handsome livery was constantly lounging about at
the entrance.</p>

<p>The Doctor himself was an elderly person, of
highly respectable appearance, and of very pleasing
manners <em>when</em> he chose to be agreeable: but no
demon could exhibit greater ferocity than he, when
compelled to exercise his authority in respect to
those amongst his patients who had no friends to
care about them.</p>

<p>It was between nine and ten o’clock in the evening
of the day following the interview between Fitzgeorge
and Heathcote’s head clerk, that a plain carriage
and pair drove up to the door of Doctor Swinton’s
establishment.</p>

<p>The porter immediately rushed forward to open
the door and let down the steps of the vehicle; and
two persons alighted.</p>

<p>One was a tall, handsome young man of genteel
bearing, and handsomely dressed: the other was
some years older, and might be described as respectable
without having anything aristocratic in
his appearance.</p>

<p>“Have the kindness to say that Mr. Smithson,
accompanied by his friend Mr. Granby, requests an
interview with your master,” were the words immediately
addressed to the porter by the elder of
the two visitors, while the other appeared to be
gazing about him in a vacant and stolid manner.</p>

<p>“Walk in, gentlemen,” said the obsequious porter,
with a low bow: he then rang a bell, and a footman
in resplendent livery opened the inner door.</p>

<p>Mr. Granby and Mr. Smithson were now conducted
through a spacious hall into an elegantly
furnished parlour, lighted by a superb lustre suspended
to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“The Doctor will be with you in a minute, gentlemen,”
said the domestic, who immediately retired
to acquaint his master with their arrival: but
the moment the door had closed behind him, a
smile of deep meaning instantly appeared upon the
lips of the visitors, as they exchanged equally significant
looks.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Dr. Swinton appeared&mdash;his
countenance wearing such a benignant expression
that if the Saints at Exeter Hall could only have
bribed him to attend on the platform at their May
Meetings, they would have secured a sufficiency of
<em>outward appearance</em> of philanthropy to draw gold
from the purses of even the most cynical. In fact,
the doctor was precisely the individual from whose
lips might be expected a most touching and lachrymose
speech upon the “benighted condition” of the
heathen, and the absolute necessity of procuring
funds for the purpose of circulating a million of
Bibles amongst the poor savages of the Cannibal
Islands.</p>

<p>His thin grey hair was combed with precision
over his high and massive forehead: a smile played
on his lips, showing his well-preserved teeth;&mdash;and
his eyes beamed with mildness&mdash;almost with
meekness, as if he had succeeded, by long perseverance,
in resigning himself to a profession which
militated sadly against a natural benevolence of
heart.</p>

<p>He was dressed in deep black; his linen was of
the finest material and of snowy whiteness;&mdash;he
wore a low cravat; and his enormous shirt-frill was
prevented from projecting too much by means of a
diamond pin that could not have cost less than
fifty guineas.</p>

<p>The middle finger of his right hand was adorned
with a ring of equal value; and a massive chain
with a bunch of gold seals depended from his fob.</p>

<p>We should have observed that the Doctor wore
black silk stockings and shoes&mdash;it being evening;
and we have every cause to believe that the reader
may now form a tolerably accurate idea of that
gentleman’s personal appearance.</p>

<p>Leaning forward as he walked, and with a kind
of mincing gait&mdash;half familiar, and half obsequious&mdash;Dr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
Swinton advanced towards the visitors, only
one of whom rose at his approach;&mdash;and this was
Mr. Smithson, the elder of the two. The other remained
in an apparent state of apathetic laziness
on the sofa, where he had taken his seat.</p>

<p>“Your most obedient, Mr. Smithson,” said the
Doctor, proffering his hand to the individual whom
he thus addressed. “This is your friend Mr. Granby,
I presume&mdash;the gentleman of whom you made mention
when you honoured me with a visit this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Doctor&mdash;that is indeed my unfortunate
friend Granby,” responded Smithson, drawing the
physician into the window-recess, and speaking in
a whisper.</p>

<p>“He is a fine, handsome young man,” observed
the mad-doctor, glancing towards the subject of his
remark, and likewise adopting a low tone. “What
a pity it is!” he added, turning towards Mr. Smithson,
and placing his fore-finger significantly to his
forehead.</p>

<p>“A thousand&mdash;thousand pities, Doctor!” was the
reply, delivered in a mournful voice. “Such a
splendid intellect to be thus clouded!&mdash;such a genius
to be thus crushed&mdash;annihilated!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;do not anticipate such a calamity,” hastily
interposed the physician. “Rather let us hope that
a judicious system&mdash;<em>my</em> system, Mr. Smithson&mdash;will
eventually succeed in effecting a cure. But have
you the regular certificates, my dear sir?&mdash;because
you are well aware that a heavy responsibility rests
upon gentlemen of my profession, who receive patients&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Everything is straightforward, Doctor,” interrupted
Mr. Smithson, producing two papers from
his pocket. “These certificates are signed by medical
men of eminence, and whose honour is unimpeachable.”</p>

<p>“Oh! assuredly,” exclaimed Swinton, glancing
over the documents: “Dr. Prince is an ornament to
the profession&mdash;and Mr. Spicer is equally well
known. I have not the pleasure of their personal
acquaintance&mdash;but I am no stranger to their high
reputation and rigid integrity. So far, so good, my
dear sir,” continued the mad-doctor, restoring the
certificates to Smithson. “And now, I think,
we have little more to say in respect to arrangements&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nothing that I am aware of,” interrupted Mr.
Smithson. “When I saw you this morning, you
told me that your usual terms for first-class patients
were six hundred a-year&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Each quarter payable in advance, you will please
to recollect, my dear sir,” said the physician, in a
tone of bland insinuation. “It is a mere matter of
form, you know&mdash;just the bare trouble of writing a
cheque at the beginning instead of the close of the
three months&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! pray offer no apology for such an excellent
regulation,” interrupted Smithson: “short
accounts make long friends.”</p>

<p>“Ah! ah! very good&mdash;very good indeed!” said
the Doctor, with a jocular cachinnation. “You are
quite right, my dear sir&mdash;quite right. Shall I give
you a stamped receipt?” he asked, as Smithson
placed in his hands two bank notes&mdash;one for a
hundred and the other for fifty pounds.</p>

<p>“You can send me the acknowledgment at your
leisure,” answered Smithson. “And now, as I
must take my leave, permit me to beseech you to
bestow all possible attention upon my unhappy
friend, and to spare no expense in rendering him as
comfortable as possible. His relations, who have
empowered me thus to place him in your establishment,
are very wealthy, and will cheerfully augment
the allowance, if required. No coercion is necessary
with him: he is very tractable and by no means
dangerous. At the same time, any thing resembling
restraint would only induce him to move heaven
and earth to escape. He cannot even endure to
have his chamber-door locked at night; and you
may safely trust him with a candle. Indeed, he
<em>will</em> have a light. As for placing a keeper in his
room, such a step would be as unwise as it is uncalled
for. But I need not attempt to counsel a
gentleman of your great experience and well-known
skill&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my dear sir,” interrupted Dr. Swinton,
drawing himself up at the compliment thus
paid to his professional ability;&mdash;“but I am always
delighted to receive any hints which the friends of
my patients are kind enough to give me; and I can
assure you that your suggestions shall be fully
borne in mind. Of course you will call upon Mr.
Granby occasionally?” asked the Doctor, in a tone
which was as much as to imply that the less frequent
such visits were, the better he thought it
would be.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I shall call now and then,” responded
Smithson, catching the physician’s meaning in a
moment: “but not too often&mdash;as the visits of friends
are likely, no doubt, to produce an injurious effect
on those minds which, under the influence of your
admirable system, are becoming settled and tranquil.
It is however my intention to return in a few
days, just to assure myself that Granby is comfortable,
and likewise that you are not displeased with
your patient.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the Doctor; “I shall be delighted
to see you. But will you not remain and
partake of supper with us? You will then have an
opportunity of judging how I treat my patients&mdash;for
we all sit down to table together,&mdash;at least,
those who belong to the first class, and who may be
termed the parlour boarders. Besides, I forgot to
mention to you this morning that the religious
principles of my patients are not neglected, and
that I keep a regular chaplain in the establishment.
If you will stay to supper, you will have the pleasure
of hearing him say grace before meat, and deliver
a most soul-refreshing exhortation afterwards.
Indeed, I may consider myself highly fortunate in
having secured the spiritual services and the constant
companionship of such a worthy man as the
Reverend Mr. Sheepshanks.”</p>

<p>“I should be much gratified by remaining to partake
of your hospitality,” answered Smithson,&mdash;“and
even still more rejoiced to form the acquaintance
of such an estimable character as Mr. Sheepshanks;
but, unfortunately, my time is precious&mdash;and
I must depart at once.”</p>

<p>With these words Smithson turned away from
the window; and approaching Mr. Granby, who was
lounging upon the sofa, seemingly gazing on vacancy,
he touched him on the shoulder, saying,
“Good bye, my dear friend: you are going to stay
here for a few days with Dr. Swinton&mdash;and you will
find yourself very comfortable.”</p>

<p>“I am already very comfortable,” observed Granby,
beginning to play with his fingers in a stolid, silly
manner. “Can you talk with the hands, Smithson?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;and I will come to-morrow and hold
a conversation with you by that method,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;don’t forget,” said Granby; “and bring
all my friends with you,&mdash;twenty&mdash;thirty&mdash;forty of
them, if you like. I shall know how to entertain
them.”</p>

<p>“In that case I will bring them all, my dear fellow,”
returned Smithson: then, in a whisper to the
Doctor, he observed, “You perceive how childish he
is&mdash;but perfectly harmless.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I begin to fear with you that his cure will
be no easy nor speedily-accomplished matter,” responded
the physician, also in a low tone.</p>

<p>“But you will do your best, Doctor, I know,”
said Smithson: then, turning once more to his
friend, he exclaimed, “Good-bye, Granby&mdash;I am
off.”</p>

<p>“Well, go&mdash;I don’t mean to accompany you,”
answered the patient, without moving from his recumbent
position, and without even glancing towards
Smithson; but maintaining his eyes fixed
upon his fingers, with which he appeared to be
practising the dumb alphabet. “Go along, I say&mdash;I
am very comfortable where I am.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson heaved a profound sigh, and, bidding
the Doctor farewell, hurried to the carriage, with
his cambric handkerchief to his eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah! he feels deeply for his afflicted friend,”
thought Dr. Swinton, as he remained for a few moments
on the threshold of the front door, looking
forth into the mild, clear, and beauteous night:
“but I shall be the greatest fool in existence if
ever I allow Mr. Granby to recover his reason. An
annuity of six hundred pounds is not to be thrown
away in a hurry. But I must prevent this fellow
Smithson from calling more than once or twice a-year
at the outside&mdash;and then only on stated days, or
else with a week’s notice. However, I shall get
him here to supper in a short time, and will then
cajole him into anything I propose. He is a soft-pated
fool himself,&mdash;<em>that</em> I can see with half an
eye.”</p>

<p>Having arrived at this complimentary conclusion
in respect to Mr. Smithson, the Doctor returned
to the room where Mr. Granby was still lying
upon the sofa, and still playing with his fingers.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXXVII">CHAPTER CLXXXVII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.</span></h2>

<p>Almost immediately after the departure of Mr.
Smithson, supper was served up in a spacious and
handsomely-furnished apartment.</p>

<p>The table literally groaned beneath the load of
plate and China spread upon it: a splendid epergne,
upon a large silver tray, occupied the middle of the
board;&mdash;and numerous crystal decanters, containing
choice wines of various sorts, sparkled in the
flood of golden light poured forth from a magnificent
lustre suspended to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Upwards of a dozen persons took their places at
the table&mdash;all the first-class patients partaking of
their meals in the delectable society of the Doctor.</p>

<p>That eminent individual seated himself at the
head of the board; and our old friend, Mr. Sheepshanks,
occupied the other extremity. The reverend
gentleman, though now well stricken in years, was
so little altered since the reader last found himself
in his company, that no minute description of his
personal appearance is again necessary: suffice it
to say, that his long, pale countenance was as sanctimoniously
hypocritical at ever,&mdash;his hair, now
quite grey, was combed with its wonted sleekness
over his forehead,&mdash;and his speech was as drawling
in tone and as full of cant in respect to language,
as when we beheld him holding forth to the members
of the South Sea Islands Bible Circulating
Society, or figuring so ignominiously in the Insolvents’
Court.</p>

<p>Mr. Granby, being a new-comer, was placed in
the post of honour&mdash;namely, on the Doctor’s right
hand: but the unfortunate young gentleman did
not appear to understand, much lest appreciate the
distinction&mdash;for he scarcely uttered a syllable, did
but little justice to the succulent viands, and remained
for the most part of the time gazing in
listless vacancy straight before him.</p>

<p>We should however observe that, on first being
introduced into the supper-room, he had darted a
rapid and searching glance around,&mdash;embracing
with that sweeping look the countenances of the
dozen patients who were already assembled there:
but immediately afterwards he resumed his stolid,
meaningless expression, as if his mind were indeed
a blank and mournful void.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Sheepshanks,” said the Doctor, when
all were duly seated at the table, “will you ask the
usual blessing?”</p>

<p>“With your permission, most respected sir,” replied
the reverend gentleman: then, with a countenance
as rueful as if he were about to go forth to
the place of execution, he drawled out a lengthy
grace in such a droning voice, that one of the
lunatics fell fast asleep, and did not wake up again
until the savoury odour of a plate of roast duck
which was placed before him recalled to him his
recollection and his supper.</p>

<p>“How do you find yourself this evening, Mr.
Sheepshanks?” inquired Dr. Swinton, after having
assured himself that all his guests were duly served.
“You were complaining of a bilious attack this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Alas! yes, kind sir,” responded the reverend
gentleman, in a most doleful tone and with a profound
sigh: “it pleased the Lord to ordain that the
salmon of which I partook bountifully at yesterday’s
dinner should disagree with me&mdash;or peradventure
it was the cucumber;&mdash;but, by the aid of
the Divine blessing and the black draught, my dear
patron, I have pretty well come round again.
Nevertheless, I feel my appetite failing me.”</p>

<p>And as he uttered these words, Mr. Sheepshanks
helped himself to about a pound and a quarter of
pigeon-pie&mdash;that being his second attack on the
same dish.</p>

<p>“I shall be happy to assist you to some roast
duck, Mr. Sheepshanks,” said the Doctor, after a
pause of about seven minutes.</p>

<p>“It would be an act of rudeness to decline an
offer which bespeaks such delicate attentions on
your part, worthy sir,” returned the pious gentleman.
“I have just managed to pick a morsel of
this savoury pie; and I will endeavour to get
through the wing of a duck, with heaven’s assistance.”</p>

<p>“So you shall,” said the Doctor. “In the meantime
I recommend you to take a little wine&mdash;for
your stomach’s sake.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span></p>

<p>“Ah! that was salutary advice which Paul gave
to Timothy&mdash;‘<em>a little wine for the stomach’s sake</em>,’”
drawled out the excellent Mr. Sheepshanks;&mdash;and
to prove that he really thought so, he filled a
tumbler with claret and imbibed the delicious
draught without a pause.</p>

<p>By this time a plate, containing the wing, leg,
and part of the breast of a duck, was placed before
him; and, with a hollow groan as if he thought he
should never get through it all, he commenced the
attack.</p>

<p>We may here observe that the Doctor, who was
a widower, was fond of good living himself, and was
well pleased when he found any one inclined to
keep him company in the enjoyment of the pleasures
of the table. For this reason he especially admired
the Reverend Mr. Sheepshanks; and he well knew
that when his chaplain pretended to have no appetite
at all, he was in reality prepared to do ample
justice to every dish. Hence the copious supply of
duck which the physician had sent him; and that
hospitable gentleman heard with secret pleasure
the groan which Mr. Sheepshanks had given, and
which was a sure indication that the modesty of the
reverend glutton would be so far overcome as to
induce him to allow the Doctor to help him again
presently.</p>

<p>And here we may likewise remark that Swinton
was no niggard of his good cheer. If he kept an
excellent table, he liked to see justice done to the
viands served up; and, as he received handsome
remuneration from the friends of his first-class
patients, he could well afford to regale them sumptuously,
and amass a splendid fortune out of them
into the bargain.</p>

<p>In conversation of the trivial kind of which we
have just recorded a specimen, did the Doctor
and Sheepshanks pass the time during supper,&mdash;the
patients all maintaining a profound silence, and
conducting themselves with the most perfect propriety.
Indeed, were it not for a certain vacancy
in the eyes of some, and a peculiar but inexplicable
expression in the looks of the rest, it were impossible
for a stranger to believe that there were any
lunatics at all in the room.</p>

<p>After supper Mr. Sheepshanks delivered himself
of a long prayer;&mdash;but as his libations had been
somewhat copious, in spite of his bilious attack, his
voice was occasionally so thick as to be unintelligible,&mdash;and
it appeared as if he at times fancied himself
to be an Irvingite speaking in the unknown
tongues. Towards the conclusion of his oration,
which very much resembled a funeral sermon in
those parts where the meaning and sense could be
caught, the reverend gentleman became so much
affected that he began to weep; and had a maliciously-disposed
person been present, he would have
probably entertained the derogatory notion that
Mr. Sheepshanks was in that maudlin condition
vulgarly termed “crying drunk.”</p>

<p>However, the affair passed off to the satisfaction
of the worthy Doctor, who, as he thought of
all that his chaplain had eaten and drunk during
the evening, felt really proud of having beneath his
roof a man of such splendid qualifications.</p>

<p>The after-supper oration being concluded, the
keepers, all dressed in plain clothes, made their
appearance to conduct the patients to their respective
chambers; but as this was Granby’s first night
in the house, the Doctor volunteered to show him
to the apartment prepared for his reception.</p>

<p>The new inmate of the asylum immediately obeyed
the hint which the physician gave him relative to
the hour for retiring; and he was forthwith escorted
up a handsome staircase to a long corridor on the
second floor. From this passage, which was carpeted,
adorned with statues in recesses, and lighted
by lamps hanging to the ceiling, opened several
rooms, the doors of which were numbered.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the passage the Doctor pulled
a wire which communicated with a bell on the
storey overhead; and a matronly, respectable-looking
woman made her appearance in answer to
the summons.</p>

<p>“Which chamber is Mr. Granby to occupy, Mrs. Probert?”
said the Doctor to his housekeeper&mdash;for
such was the situation filled by the female.</p>

<p>“I have moved the gentleman&mdash;you know whom
I mean, sir&mdash;that was in Number 7&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! I understand,” interrupted the physician,
with some degree of impatience, as if he were afraid
that his housekeeper was about to be more communicative
than was necessary in the presence of
the stranger. “Well&mdash;you have removed a certain
person&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To Number 12, sir,” replied Mrs. Probert; “and
therefore Mr. Granby will please to occupy Number
7.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the Doctor. “Now, Mr.
Granby, my dear friend&mdash;have the kindness to follow
me.”</p>

<p>The request was instantaneously obeyed; and
the physician conducted his docile patient into the
room that had been selected for him, and which was
indeed the most spacious, airy, and elegantly furnished
bed-chamber in the whole establishment. It
was usually appropriated to any new-comer of the
first class whose friends appeared to take an interest
in him; so that on the occasion of their first
visit after his location in the asylum, the doctor
might be enabled to show them, with pride, and
even triumph, the magnificent apartment in which
the patient was lodged. It was afterwards an easy
matter to remove him to another and inferior,
though still comfortable chamber&mdash;so as to make
room for another arrival; and it was very seldom
that a lunatic ever thought of mentioning to his
friends, when they visited him again, the change of
apartments that had taken place.</p>

<p>Having introduced Mr. Granby into the elegantly
furnished chamber, the Doctor placed the candle
upon the table, wished the young gentleman a
good night’s rest, and then retired&mdash;closing, but
not locking, the door behind him.</p>

<p>The moment he had departed, a remarkable and
signal change took place in the appearance and
manner of Mr. Granby. His countenance lost its
stolid vacancy of expression, and became animated
with its natural intelligence; and, instead of seeming
a dull, drivelling idiot, he stood erect&mdash;a fine
intrepid young man, conscious of the possession of
superior mental faculties, and prepared to carry out
effectually the scheme which had already been so
successfully commenced.</p>

<p>Indeed, all further mystery in this respect being
unnecessary, we may as well at once declare that
the fictitious Mr. Granby was the real Lord William
Trevelyan&mdash;and that Smithson, who had so well
performed the part of an afflicted and faithful
friend, was none, other than the astute valet, Fitzgeorge.</p>

<p>The young nobleman had made confidants of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
two friends, Dr. Prince and Mr. Spicer, who at his
request had drawn up and signed the certificates
necessary to procure his introduction into the abode
of Dr. Swinton.</p>

<p>We must likewise here observe that when the
short colloquy had occurred between the Doctor
and his housekeeper, it instantly struck Trevelyan
that allusion was made by them to Sir Gilbert Heathcote
as being the individual whose sleeping-place had
been changed from No. 7 to No. 12. He had noticed
that the woman had observed a degree of mystery in
referring, in the first instance, to the late occupant of
the best bed-room&mdash;and that the Doctor, as if fearful
that walls had ears, or that even a lunatic (such as
he believed Trevelyan to be) might learn a dangerous
secret, had hastily interposed to prevent Mrs.
Probert from making a more direct allusion. All
these circumstances induced Trevelyan to conjecture
that the late occupant of his room was none
other than Sir Gilbert; and, if this were the case,
he had acquired the certainty that the baronet was
the tenant of a neighbouring apartment in the
same corridor.</p>

<p>It was now eleven o’clock; and the young nobleman
resolved to wait until a much later hour ere
he took any steps in pursuance of the clue which
he believed himself to have gained relative to the
chamber occupied by his persecuted friend.</p>

<p>He walked to the window, and looked forth
through the iron bars, upon the mass of narrow
lanes and squalid alleys constituting the suburb
known as Globe Town, and all the features of
which were brought vividly forward in the powerful
moonlight,&mdash;for the atmosphere was as bright as if
it were of transparent quicksilver.</p>

<p>But in a few minutes, Trevelyan grew wearied of
the sameness of the prospect, so still and inanimate
at that hour; and he began to examine, more
minutely than at first, the chamber in which he
found himself.</p>

<p>A massive wardrobe of dark mahogany, and elaborately
carved, particularly attracted his notice;
and, impelled by that curiosity which frequently
seizes upon persons who seek to while away an
hour or two by any means that opportunity or accident
may afford, he opened the large and heavy
doors. There were several shelves inside, filled
with blankets and counterpanes, evidently deposited
there during the summer-months, when the beds
required less clothing than in winter.</p>

<p>Trevelyan was about to close the doors, when
he suddenly caught sight of something that appeared
to be a roll of papers thrust between the
blankets. He drew forth the object of his attention,
and found that his conjecture was correct;
for he held in his hand a manuscript consisting of
several folios of foolscap closely written upon in a
genteel and fluent style.</p>

<p>A farther examination of the papers showed him,
by means of certain dates, that the manuscript was
only recently composed; and an indescribable feeling
of interest, superior to any thing like vulgar
curiosity, prompted him to read the documents that
had thus strangely fallen into his possession.</p>

<p>Besides, he had determined to let a couple of
hours slip away ere he took any step in pursuance
of the design that had brought him to the mad-house;
and he was by no means sorry at having
discovered a mode of passing the interval otherwise
than by restlessly pacing his chamber or gazing
from the window.</p>

<p>He accordingly seated himself at the table, and
commenced the perusal of the extraordinary document
that will be found in the ensuing chapter.</p>

<span class="medium">THE CONFESSIONS OF A LUNATIC.</span></h2>

<p>“My blood has been boiling like a lava-stream.
It appears to me as if I can now freely respire the
fresh air, after having only breathed by gasps. What
agony, then, has it been that has thus convulsed my
soul?&mdash;of what kind was the anguish which has
left such strange and unnatural sensations behind?
Have I just awakened from a reverie of burning
thoughts and appalling visions?&mdash;or was there any
truth in the hideous things which seem to have
passed like a frightful phantasmagoria through my
brain? What means this suffocating sob that has
struggled upward, and as it were spontaneously
from my breast? O God! it appears to me now as
if the wildest&mdash;most maniacal ideas have crowded
into volumes, but become compressed into instants!
Do I rave?&mdash;am I really here&mdash;in a room elegantly
furnished&mdash;and seated at this table, writing? Is
the bright sun-light streaming in at the open casement?&mdash;and
does the breeze penetrate into the
chamber, fanning my feverish cheek and throbbing
brow, and wafting to me the delicious perfume
of flowers? Is all this true&mdash;or a dream?
Am I still a denizen of the earth,&mdash;that earth of
which I seem for some time to have lost all forgetfulness&mdash;dwelling
during the interval in a chaos
peopled with horrible images&mdash;ghastly spectres&mdash;frightful
beings of nondescript shape? Oh, I remember&mdash;I
found this paper, this pen, and this ink
in that large and massive ward-robe so exquisitely
carved;&mdash;and something tells me that there are persons
watching my movements&mdash;spying my actions&mdash;and
who will be angry with me&mdash;perhaps ill-treat
me&mdash;if they behold me writing down my ideas. Oh!
I am afraid&mdash;I am afraid. My God! where am I?
There is a hurry in my brain&mdash;my blood again
begins to boil&mdash;my hand trembles as I write. But
wherefore do I write at all? I know not:&mdash;and yet
it seems to do me good!</p>

<p>“If any persons&mdash;any of those men whom I remember
to have seen just now&mdash;should endeavour
to enter the room, I will hide my papers in yonder
ward-robe. Or else under the bed?&mdash;or between
the mattresses? No: in that ward-robe&mdash;it is the
safest place, I feel confident.</p>

<p>“But why should I not go forth and walk in
that garden which I can see from the window?&mdash;or
else penetrate into the fields at a great distance,
and lie down and think? If the breeze coming into
this room, does me good, how much more refreshed
should I feel were I to ramble about in the open
country! Yes&mdash;I will go.</p>

<p>“What does this mean? I have tried the door&mdash;and
it is locked! Who dares to treat me thus&mdash;<em>me</em>&mdash;a
gentleman of birth and fortune? I will
not endure such conduct: I will appeal to my
brother, the magistrate, for protection. He shall
hang the wretches who have perpetrated this insolence.</p>

<p>“O God! what do I see? There are bars at the
window! Great heavens! I shall go mad!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mad!</span> Yes&mdash;that was the last word that I wrote
yesterday&mdash;I suppose it must have been yesterday&mdash;when
I so hastily concealed my papers, on hearing
some one approach the door. I remember <em>that</em> full
well! Yes&mdash;it was an elderly man, with a mild and
benevolent countenance&mdash;dressed in black, with
linen beautifully white&mdash;and with a massive chain
and seals. I looked at him well: but I knew him
not. I do not think that I ever saw him before.
He sate down by my side&mdash;felt my pulse&mdash;and asked
me several questions. Ah! a thought flashes to my
mind: that good old gentleman is a doctor. And
now,&mdash;yes&mdash;I think I can recollect it all,&mdash;I abused
him&mdash;I insulted him very grossly;&mdash;and then some
men entered and compelled me to go to bed. They
undressed me by force. I struggled against them;
but it was useless.</p>

<p>“Oh! what does it all mean? Why those men
to coerce me?&mdash;why that doctor to attend upon
me?&mdash;and why those bars at the window? Gracious
God! it cannot be&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;the horrible
thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes: it must be so&mdash;I am really mad!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Again I sit down, calmly and tranquilly, to
write. I have weighed well my condition&mdash;have
asked myself a thousand questions&mdash;have read what
I have written above&mdash;have striven to recollect all
the past&mdash;have carefully examined the present&mdash;and
have dared to think of the future. By all this&mdash;and
by the bars at the window&mdash;I know that I
am <em>mad</em>!</p>

<p>“Yes: but I can write the word now without
growing excited; and I must practise writing it
again, so that I may by degrees gather to my aid
such an amount of self-possession as to be able to
trace on this paper all that has occurred to me.
Then shall I possess a positive memorial&mdash;a substantial
key to the past; and should I again forget,
in an interval of delirium, all that has occurred, I
can speedily recommit the mournful history to my
memory during a lucid interval like the present.</p>

<p>“<em>Mad&mdash;mad&mdash;mad&mdash;mad!</em> There&mdash;now I can
write the word without the least excitement; and
this is a triumph already achieved. By gaining a
complete and accurate knowledge of my real position,
I shall know how to act. I am aware that
I am in a lunatic asylum: I am also aware that I
have passed through intervals of fearful delirium.
But I must compose myself as much as possible.
I cannot remain in this horrible place;&mdash;and if I
cannot become really sane again, I may at all events
pretend to be so&mdash;and then they will let me out.
But in order to regain my intellects, or appear to
recover my reason, I must remember all that has
occurred to me, so as to be enabled to converse
calmly and sensibly on the subject. Stay! I will
think&mdash;I will reflect profoundly for the rest of the
day; and to-morrow I will resume my pen.</p>

<p>“God forbid that the doctor or his men&mdash;or that
prying old housekeeper, should look into the wardrobe!
I would not lose my manuscript for worlds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="author">
“<em>June 13th, 1846.</em><br />
</p>

<p>“I have learnt the day of the month. The doctor
has been with me for an hour; and he readily complied
with my request to be furnished with an almanack.
He told me that this is the 13th of June;
and henceforth I hope I shall be enabled to keep
the dates accurately. When I was at school&mdash;but
that is many years ago!&mdash;I used to make an almanack
to calculate how long it was to the holidays;
and every evening I scratched out the day that had
just passed. Oh! happy&mdash;happy age of boyhood&mdash;wilt
thou never come back? hast thou gone for
ever? Now must I erase each day as it passes, and
hope that the period of my release is near at hand.
<em>That</em> shall be the holiday of my manhood, to which
I must look forward with such anxious&mdash;fervid&mdash;burning
hope!</p>

<p>“But to my narrative.</p>

<p>“A hundred thousand pounds became mine on
the day that I attained my majority. That was
nine years ago! I was my own master: my parents
had long been dead&mdash;and my guardians attempted
not even to advise me&mdash;much less control me. They
were not relations&mdash;mere men of business to whom
my fortune had been intrusted, with a view to its
accumulation. The moment I became possessed of
that wealth, I plunged headlong into the vortex
of pleasure. Heavens! in what dissipation did I
indulge. Who could drink deeper than I, and walk
home steadily afterwards?&mdash;who was more sought
after and caressed amongst the fair sex?&mdash;who was a
more constant attendant at race-courses, gaming-houses,
and the haunts of fashionable vice and aristocratic
debauchery? Fool that I was! I imagined that
to spend money profusely, was to enjoy life largely.
I had three mistresses at the same time,&mdash;three
women, having each a separate establishment, maintained
at my cost! What were the consequences?
At five-and-twenty my constitution was nearly
ruined, and eighty thousand pounds of my fortune
had been expended. The very principles of my
existence seemed to be undermined&mdash;disease was
gnawing at my vitals&mdash;an unbroken career of the
wildest dissipation was hurrying me, with race-horse
speed, to the tomb!</p>

<p>“Suddenly I awoke, as from a dream. But it
was not because remorse touched me,&mdash;nor because
good counsels were proffered me,&mdash;nor because
some latent feelings of virtue sprang into existence.
Neither was it because my fortune was nearly
wasted and my health failing rapidly. No: but it
was because I at that epoch saw my Editha for the
first time! Oh! how can I retain my calmness
<em>now</em>, when I think of her as I <em>then</em> beheld her,&mdash;beheld
her in all the glory of her matchless
beauty&mdash;radiant with that loveliness that seemed
to surround her with the halo that only angels have!
Yes&mdash;I was then twenty-five, and Editha Greville
was nineteen&mdash;that delightful age when the female
figure swells into womanly loveliness&mdash;round, full,
and exquisitely modelled!</p>

<p>“We loved&mdash;almost at first sight; and though
several weeks passed ere I ventured to declare my
passion, I could read in Editha’s eyes that I was far
from being displeasing to her. She was an only
child; her father was dead; her mother, though a
woman of considerable wealth, mixed little in society;
and the wildness of my conduct was not
therefore fully known to Mrs. Greville. At the
same time, she had heard that I was extravagant
and imprudent; but when I implored her to bestow
upon me the hand of her daughter, she yielded her
assent, expressing a hope that I had sown all my
wild oats by that time, and should grow steady in a
matrimonial state. Thus was it that I became the
recognised suitor of Editha; and when some of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
Mrs. Greville’s friends, who knew me well, represented
to her that I was notoriously a half-ruined
rake, the old lady had too much confidence in all
the promises of reformation which I had made, to
revoke the consent she had given to our union.
Besides, she saw that Editha was deeply attached
to me, and that the beauteous girl’s happiness depended
on the smooth progress of love’s course.</p>

<div id="i_337" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_337.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“But, alas! painful thoughts forced themselves
upon my mind. I felt that my constitution was
ruined&mdash;and I believed myself to be in a consumption.
Faithful to the solemn pledges which I had
made to Mrs. Greville, I established a complete
change in my habits; and instead of drinking wine
to excess, I foreswore all alcoholic liquor whatsoever.
Likewise, instead of passing my nights in
dissipation, I returned home at an early hour and
sought my couch. But the suddenness of this
alteration in my habits produced effects which I
can only compare to the terrible reaction that a
man experiences when waking in the morning after
a night of deep debauch. A dead weight fell upon
my spirits. I became so low and depressed that
horrible thoughts of suicide were constantly floating
in my brain. My nervousness was extreme,
and intensely painful. An unusually loud knock
or ring at the front-door would make me start as
if I had committed a crime and was expecting the
officers of justice to come and arrest me. I was
constantly conjuring up the most shocking visions
respecting the future; and when immersed in those
reveries, I verily believed that I was contemplating
realities&mdash;such was the morbid state of my mind!</p>

<p>“It was therefore natural that I should begin to
reflect upon the step which I had taken with regard
to Editha. I had sought and won the affections of
a beautiful creature, who was possessed of a generous
heart, an amiable disposition, and a loving
soul; and I was shocked to think that such a
being, in all the vigorous health of youthfulness,
should be led to the altar by one whose constitution
was shattered, whose vital energies were almost
ruined, and who seemed to be hovering on the very
verge of the tomb! Oh! how maddening were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
these thoughts! I looked upon myself as a villain&mdash;a
deceiver; and often&mdash;often was I on the
point of throwing myself at Mrs. Greville’s feet
and exclaiming, ‘<em>Pardon me, madam, for having
dared to ask the hand of your daughter in marriage!
I am but a phantom&mdash;a shadow: the finger of
Death is upon me,&mdash;and if Editha should accompany
me to the altar, it is probable that in less than a year
she will have to follow me to the tomb!</em>’&mdash;But when I
thought of Editha’s matchless beauty, and pondered
upon the immensity of the love that I experienced
for her, I could not command the courage necessary
to enable me to resign the hope of possessing such
a treasure. Besides, in her society I could smile
and be gay: her musical voice was more ravishing
to my ears than the inspired strains of an improvisatrice;&mdash;her
breath was more fragrant than the
perfume of flowers&mdash;her lips more delicious than
the honey-dew upon the blossoms! Oh! no&mdash;no:
I could not resign my Editha! But no day had
been as yet fixed for our marriage&mdash;and six weeks
had already elapsed since I had proposed and was
accepted. Shall I confess the truth? I dared not
ask her mother to name the day: I shrank from
the idea as if I were meditating a murder&mdash;had
marked out my victim&mdash;but dreaded to settle in my
own mind the night and the hour when the assassin-blow
should be struck!</p>

<p>“I was lying in bed one morning, reflecting on
all these things&mdash;for the dark fit of despondency
was upon me&mdash;when my valet entered the room
with the morning’s newspapers. I listlessly unfolded
one of the journals, when my eyes suddenly
caught sight of an advertisement, headed thus:&mdash;‘<em>Manhood,
the Reasons of its Early Decline; with
Plain Hints for its Complete Resuscitation.</em>’ This book
was announced to be an emanation from the pen of
T. L. Surtees and Co., Consulting Surgeons, residing
in one of the streets leading out of Soho Square;
and it appeared by certain quotations of notices
from the leading newspapers, that the book was a
medical treatise of great utility, merit, and importance.
Hope now dawned in upon my soul. Perhaps
my constitution was not irretrievably damaged?
Perchance I might not be in a consumption, after
all? Such were my thoughts, after perusing that
advertisement over and over again; and I resolved
to lose no time in calling upon the able practitioners
who undertook the resuscitation of any constitution,
no matter how hopeless the case might seem.
Accordingly, having hastily dressed myself, I repaired
in a street cab to the address indicated in the
advertisement. The house was one of imposing appearance;
and the words ‘<em>Surtees and Co., Consulting
Surgeons</em>,’ were displayed in deep-black letters,
on immense shining zinc-plates. The fawn-coloured
Venetian blinds were drawn down; and I said to
myself, as I alighted with a fluttering heart, ‘Doubtless
these eminent practitioners have patients waiting
in every room to consult them.’ Entering the
passage, I found an inner door, with a bronze
knocker and a ground-glass fan-light, on which
were inscribed the same words as those that appeared
on the polished zinc-plates. I was immediately
admitted by a footman, and conducted up
stairs to a drawing-room, every feature of which is
at this moment as fresh in my memory as if I were
seated and writing there now.</p>

<p>“This apartment at first sight impressed me with
an idea of luxurious splendour; but a closer examination
into its appointments showed me that the
most vulgar taste had presided over its fitting-up.
The paper was of crimson and gold; and to the
walls were suspended several paintings set in magnificent
frames, which only rendered the daubs the
more miserably ludicrous. Two of them were
covered with plate-glass, as if they were very valuable;
whereas they were as wretched as the others.
‘Some unprincipled person,’ thought I, ‘must have
imposed upon these worthy doctors, by recommending
pictures to which I would not accord house-room.
But men of philosophic minds and who are
devoted to professional studies, are seldom good
judges of works of art.’ Thus ruminating, I continued
my examination of the apartment; and I was
struck with surprise at the utter vulgarity and absence
of taste which characterised the profusion of
French porcelain ornaments scattered about. Here
was a Chinese Joss, with a moveable head: and
there was a pedlar mounted on a gigantic goat.
At the corners of the fire-place were two paintings
evidently cut out of a picture, and representing little
charity-school girls. In the centre of the room stood
a loo-table, upon which a writing-desk was placed;
and this was surrounded by medical publications,
bearing on their title-pages the magical names of
those gentlemen whom I was so anxiously waiting to
see. I had the curiosity to open one of the works:
but I was disgusted with the obscenity of the
coloured plates which it contained. A moment’s
reflection, however, induced me to believe that there
could be nothing indecent in the development of the
divine art of surgery; and I felt ashamed of myself
for having even for an instant entertained such
scruples. As a concluding observation respecting
the drawing-room itself, I must remark that its
entire appearance indicated the taste of a vulgar
upstart, rather than the refined elegance of a polished
mind.</p>

<p>“Having waited nearly three quarters of an hour,
a footman made his appearance, and, with many
obsequious bows, conducted me down stairs into a
dining-room most gaudily and extravagantly furnished.
The same grovelling vulgarity of taste
which I had noticed elsewhere was apparent in the
crimson damask curtains with yellow fringes and
tassels&mdash;the looking-glasses in ponderous frames&mdash;the
showy daubs suspended to the walls&mdash;and the
furniture arranged for the purpose of display.
Folding-doors admitted me into an inner apartment,
of equally vulgar appearance; and beyond
was a little room, only a few feet square, and which
the footman, as he ushered me in, denominated <em>the
surgery</em>.</p>

<p>“I must confess that my heart beat violently as
I traversed those two apartments leading to the
<em>sanctum</em> where I expected to find myself in the presence
of the eminent medical practitioners. I had
pictured to myself a couple of old and venerable-looking
gentlemen, with genius stamped upon their
high bald foreheads, and their eyes expressing all
the powers of vigorous intellects. I was therefore
somewhat surprised when, on being introduced into
the surgery, I beheld only one individual, who was
the very reverse of the portraiture I had drawn by
anticipation. His features were of the Jewish cast:
his complexion was of that swarthy and greasy
description peculiar to the lower order of the
Hebrew race;&mdash;his hair was black and very thick;
and his whiskers met beneath his chin. His eyes
were dark, and one of them was larger than the
other: his bottle-nose was rather on one side; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
his countenance altogether was as ignoble, as vulgar,
and as unintellectual as ever served as an index to
a sordid, grovelling soul. His dress was of the
flashy kind which belongs partly to the upstart or
<em>parvenu</em>, and partly to the swell-mob’s-man. He
wore a blue dress-coat, a gaudy waistcoat, and
large loose trousers hollowed at the instep so as to
be shaped to the polished leathern boot. A profusion
of jewellery decorated his person;&mdash;a thick
gold chain, with a large key, depended to his
watch&mdash;his worked shirt was fastened with diamond
and blue enamel studs;&mdash;and his dirty hands were
covered with costly rings, which appeared as ill-placed
upon the clumsy, grimy fingers as pearls
would be round the neck of a pig.</p>

<p>“Such was the individual in whose presence I
found myself; and had I not been at the time in
such a desperate state of mind that I was eager to
clutch at a straw, I should at once have seen
through the man and his system. But I reassured
myself with the adage which teaches that we
should never judge by outward appearances; and
it flashed to my mind that many men remarkable
for the brilliancy of their intellect, were far from
being prepossessing in either person, manners, or
address. Moreover, I never had partaken in the
shameful, unjust, and absurd prejudices which too
many of my fellow-countrymen entertain in respect
to the Jews; and therefore the mere fact of this
Mr. Surtees being a member of the Hebrew race
produced on my mind no unfavourable impression
with regard to him.</p>

<p>“‘Pray be seated,’ said the medical gentleman,
with a tone and manner which I at the time mistook
for professional independence, but which I
have since discovered to be the vulgar insolence of
an ignorant, self-sufficient upstart. I took a chair
in compliance with the invitation given; and when
he had seated himself at his desk, he extended
his dirty but jewel-bedizened paw, saying, ‘Vill you
obleege me vith yer card?’&mdash;I did as requested;
but not without a little hesitation, for I had hoped
to avoid giving my name and address.&mdash;‘Ah! I see,’
said Mr. Surtees, in a musing tone, as he examined
the card: ‘<em>Mr. Macdonald</em>,’ he continued, reading
my name. ‘By the vay, air you any relation to the
Markiss of Burlington? ’cos his family name is the
same as your’n.’&mdash;I replied that I was not a relative
of the nobleman mentioned.&mdash;‘Vell, it don’t sinnify,’
proceeded Mr. Surtees. ‘The Markiss is a
hexcellent friend of mine. He lays under a sight
of hobligations to me. He come to me in the first
hinstance vith a constitootion so veared out and
shattered that no medical carpenter in all Hingland
could have mended it up except me. But in the
course of a foo weeks I putt him as right as a
trivet; and now he’d go through fire and vater to
sarve me. It on’y cost him a couple of thousand
pounds to get quite cured; and that was cheap
enow, ’evvins knows! But how comed you
to call upon me this mornin’? Were it
in consekvence of having perooged von of my
medical vorks? Ah! them sells vell, them
does! Or were it ’cos you seed my adwer<em>tise</em>ment
in the noospapers?’&mdash;I was so completely bewildered
by this outpouring of execrable English
and vile grammar, that for some moments I was
utterly unable to answer the questions put to me.
Was it possible that this coarse, ignorant, and self-sufficient
vulgarian could be an eminent medical
authority&mdash;the author of valuable publications&mdash;the
celebrated surgeon whom the extracts from newspapers<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
quoted in his advertisement, spoke of so
highly? I was astounded. But again did hope
blind me to what the man really was: again did I
reassure myself by the reflection that Mr. Surtees
might be an excellent surgeon, although he was a
miserable grammarian; and I accordingly recovered
my self-possession sufficiently to inform him that I
had called in consequence of reading his advertisement
in the newspapers.</p>

<p>“The doctor seemed pleased at my answer, and
immediately exclaimed, ‘Vell, sir, and vot a blessin’
it is that people <em>do</em> read adwer<em>tise</em>ments: ’cos vy?
they gets at the knowledge of heminent medikle
prektishoners, which has devoted their lives to the
hart of ealing all kinds of diseases. You see before
you, sir,’ he continued, in a pompous tone, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
arrogant air, ‘a man vot knows hevery hin and hout
of the human constitootion. No von knows so vell
as myself wot consumption raly is.’&mdash;‘Then you
have made consumption your particular study, sir?’
I observed, seeing that he paused, in order to elicit
some remark from me.&mdash;‘Rayther!’ was his laconic
answer. ‘The fact is,’ he continued, ‘foo medikle
men is aweer what consumption is, nor in vot part
of the frame it begins. Vy, I vonce knowed a gentleman,
sir, which had a rapid decline begin in the
great toe of his left foot, and travel up’ards, till it
spread itself over the hentire system. The doctors
had all give him up, and the undertaker was actiwally
thinking of the good job he should soon have
putt into his hand, ven I vos consulted. I made
him take seventeen bottles of my bootiful <em>Balm of
Zura</em>, and he rekivered in less than a fortnit.’</p>

<p>“Weak, nervous, and attenuated as I was, this
anecdote made a deep impression upon me. I forgot
the bad grammar&mdash;I lost sight of the arrogance
and self-sufficient vulgarity: I saw and heard only
the man who solemnly assured me that he had
redeemed a fellow-creature from the jaws of death,
when all other members of the faculty had given up
the case as hopeless. Mr. Surtees doubtless perceived
that he had worked me up to the pitch
suitable to his purposes; and he accordingly said,
‘Vell, my good sir, vill you be so good as to explain
wot it is that you’ve come to consult me for?’ I
then frankly and candidly confessed that I had expended
four-fifths of a large fortune in a career of
unbroken dissipation&mdash;that my constitution was
grievously impaired, if not absolutely ruined&mdash;that
since I had given up drinking and all other sources
of unnatural excitement, I was subject to such
frequent fits of despondency that the idea of suicide
was almost constantly in my imagination&mdash;that
I loved and was beloved by a beautiful girl who was
possessed of property&mdash;but that I felt afraid to contract
the matrimonial engagement, lest I should leave
her an unprotected widow in the course of a short time.
Mr. Surtees listened with great attention; and when
I had concluded, he appeared to reflect profoundly.
At length he said, ‘Vell, let’s feel yer pulse.’&mdash;I extended
my hand towards him; and he applied his
thumb to a part of my wrist where I did not suppose
that a pulse lay: but I concluded at the time
that his great proficiency in medicine had led him
to discover a new pulse, and that the best mode to
test it was with the thumb.&mdash;‘Wery veak pulse indeed!’
he said, shaking his head with as much solemnity
as the Chinese Joss up in his drawing-room
might have been expected to display. ‘But
don’t go for to give vay to despair, my dear sir; the
case is a bad ’un, I admit&mdash;a wery, wery bad ’un;
and I can’t say as how that I ever knowed a wusser.
Pray, who’s the young lady which you intends to
marry? I’ve a motive in axing.’&mdash;I thought that as
the learned gentleman was already acquainted with
my name and address, there could be no harm in
answering this new question, the more especially as
even if I refused to reply, he could easily institute
those enquiries that would lead to a knowledge of
the fact: I accordingly satisfied him on that head.
‘Ah! I don’t know her,’ he observed, carelessly:
then, after a few moments’ reflection, he said
‘Vell, I undertake to cure you; but the business
vill be a hexpensive von. You must write me
a cheque for a hundred guineas, my consultation
fee; and then I’ll tell you wot you must
do next.’&mdash;Reassured by the promises he thus
held out, I unhesitatingly gave him a draft for
the amount demanded. He then opened a drawer,
and drew forth a small case containing six bottles.
‘This here is the rale elixir of life,’ he said, in a tone of
solemn mystery: ‘it inwigorates the constitootion in
no time, and puts a reglar stopper on the adwance
of consumption. The Grand Turk has a case sent
every veek to him through his Hambassador, and all
the crowned heads in Europe is patients of mine, I
may say. Take a bottle of this bootiful balm daily;
and ven it’s all gone, come back again to me. The
price of them six is fifteen guineas; and you can
write me out another cheque at vonce.’&mdash;I hastened
to comply with this demand; and Mr. Surtees
bowed me out of the surgery.</p>

<p>“But here I must leave off writing; for I am
wearied&mdash;my brain begins to grow confused&mdash;and
my memory fails me. Oh! what a fool&mdash;what an
idiot I was, not to have seen through the man and
his quackery on the occasion of that visit, the particulars
of which I have detailed at such length.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="author">
“<em>June 18th, 1846.</em><br />
</p>

<p>“I again resume my narrative. Five days have
elapsed since I last put pen to paper; and that
interval has been one of darkness. Yes&mdash;the fit
was upon me: but it has passed&mdash;and I am now
calm and collected once again. I have just read
over all that I have written above; and I have
laughed heartily at the fidelity and minuteness of
my description of the first visit that I paid to
the quack-doctor. Let me now continue my narrative;
for the incidents are once more all fresh
and vivid in my memory.</p>

<p>“I am well aware that the imagination has
much to do with our diseases and our cures. Possessed
of what I deemed to be a salutary medicine,
my spirits rose; and at the close of each of the six
days during which the supply of balm lasted, I said
to myself, ‘I certainly feel stronger and better.’
The fits of despondency were far less frequent,
and less intense: my appetite improved&mdash;and the
colour came partially back to my cheeks. This
change was no doubt effected principally by the
steady life which I adopted, and by the increased
mental tranquillity which I experienced. I was
moreover filled with hope that a complete restoration
to health would be accomplished; and thus,
while at the time I attributed everything to the
medicine, I have not the least doubt that the stuff
was utterly valueless in itself. Editha was rejoiced
to find my spirits so much improving; and her
mother expressed her delight at the regular habits
which I had adopted. I did not mention to a soul my
visit to Mr. Surtees: that was my secret&mdash;and a
sense of shame made me cherish it religiously.
At the expiration of the week I called upon
him again, and on this occasion was at once
admitted into his surgery. There was another fee
of a hundred guineas&mdash;another six bottles of medicine
prescribed, and another cheque given for the
amount thereof. He asked me if I had read his
book yet; and I was compelled to reply in the negative.
‘Vell, never mind,’ he said; ‘I ain’t offended;
but you shall have a hopportunlty of perooging
it before you come agen. I’ll jest step up
into the drawing-room and get you von.’ He accordingly
quitted the surgery; and during his temporary
absence an irresistible feeling of curiosity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
prompted me to look at a note which lay open upon
the table. I read it; and thus it ran, word for
word:&mdash;‘<em>Dear Joe, You ax me 2 lend you mi dipplomy
for a few days, just to make a show with to a
new payshent; but i vunce for all tell you as how i’d
rayther not lett it go out of my house. Besides, it’s of
no use to you, ’cos it’s made out in the name of La’Vert,
and you’ve took the name of Surtees. So no
more from your affecshonate brother, &amp;c.</em>’&mdash;This note
was signed by the name of La’Vert; and therefore
it was apparent that the real appellation of my
friend Mr. Surtees was Joseph La’Vert. It struck
me in a moment that I had become the dupe of a
quack; but I had sufficient command over myself
to restrain my indignation when he returned to the
room. He was accompanied by a woman&mdash;I cannot
say a lady&mdash;whom he introduced to me as his
wife. And here I must pause to say a few descriptive
words of her.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Surtees was a vulgar, dark-complexioned
Jewess, with a long hooked nose. Her flesh seemed
as if it had been smeared with oil, and then wiped
with a dry towel; but on her cheeks she wore an
immoderate quantity of rouge. She was exceedingly
stout, with an enormous bust: her hair, rough
and wavy, was arranged in bands and plastered down
with quince-pips. She was dressed in the most
outrageous style, and as she herself expressed it,
’was about to go hout for a haring in the carridge.’
Her gown was of green velvet; her shawl of bright
red; and her bonnet of rose pink, adorned with a
profusion of artificial flowers, inside and out. She
wore very pink silk stockings and short petticoats,
as she had conceived the erroneous impression that
there was something attractive in her elephantine
leg. As a matter of course, she carried a complete
jeweller’s shop about her person. She wore no
gloves; and her large red hands were covered with
rings. Her ear-rings were of gold studded with
turquoise; and now her portraiture is complete.</p>

<p>“Scarcely had the ceremony of introduction
taken place, when another female bounced into
the apartment, and she was immediately presented
to me as Mrs. Surtees’ sister. Such a pair was
never seen before! They looked like a butcher’s
daughters in their Sunday’s best; and they were
attired with an evidently studied view to contrast.
For the sister’s gown was of blue velvet, her shawl
of flaunting yellow hue, and her bonnet white.
These ladles, having favoured me with a good long
stare and a few observations relative to the weather
and such-like common-place topics, quitted the
room to enter their vehicle which was waiting at
the door. Mr. Surtees had the gallantry to accompany
them as far as the carriage; and the moment
I was alone again, I had the curiosity to traverse
the two rooms and take a peep from the front window.
The equipage was in perfect keeping with
the appointments of the house and the attire of the
occupants. It was a barouche, painted bright blue
on the body: but all the under part and wheels
were of straw colour. The inside was lined with
yellow morocco. It was drawn by two brown cobs,
the harness exhibiting a profusion of silver; and
the coachman’s livery was of a gaudy blue, with
buttons also of silver.</p>

<p>“But while I was making these observations
from the window, my ears were saluted with a
brief colloquy that took place in the passage between
Mr. Surtees and his wife, ere he handed her
to the carriage. They doubtless believed that I
had remained in the surgery, and little thought
that I was near enough to catch all they said.&mdash;‘Vell,
Joe,’ exclaimed Mrs. Surtees, ‘any monzel<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
vith that pale-faced young feller vich you said
were so ’ansome and made me come in to see?’&mdash;‘A
good moza-motton,’<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> he answered, with a vulgar
chuckling laugh.&mdash;‘Oh! then, he stumped the
guelt?’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> demanded the woman, joining in the
cachinnation.&mdash;‘To be sure he did, my love,’ responded
this precious consulting-surgeon: ‘and I
means to have a good deal more out on him afore
I’ve done.’&mdash;‘Oh! wery vell, then,’ returned Mrs.
Surtees: ‘in this case the boy Abey must have a
new polka hat, and little Joe a new welwet dress out
of it’&mdash;‘All right!’ exclaimed the consulting-surgeon.
‘Come, cut along, and astonish the natives
in the park a bit. I shall jine you presently.’ He
then handed the two women into the carriage; and
I hurried back to the surgery, where I seated myself
till his return&mdash;so that he could not suspect I
had quitted the place during his temporary absence.
I longed to tell him all I knew or suspected relative
to his real character: but a fear of exposure made
me silent&mdash;and I took my leave of him with as much
civility as I could bring myself to bestow upon such
a person.</p>

<p>“I knew that I had been completely and thoroughly
victimised: but on reflection, I was glad of
it. I saw that the circumstance of taking the
medicine had stimulated my imagination, and had
thereby aided in improving my health. On my
return home, I threw the six bottles away without
drinking another drop of the trashy balm; and I
sent at once for a respectable physician, who, for
a fee of five guineas, gave me proper advice. I then
came to the conclusion that it is always better,
under any emergency, to have recourse to legitimate
assistance than to seek the aid of advertisers&mdash;no
matter whether the subject involved be medicine,
law, or money. My health improved rapidly;
and at the expiration of three months I became
the happy husband of the equally happy Editha.</p>

<p>Here must I pause for a time: the recollection
of my wedding-day has revived memories which
overpower me!</p>

“<em>June 20th, 1846.</em><br />
</p>

<p>“I resume my narrative. Twelve months had
elapsed after my marriage with the loveliest and
most amiable woman in the universe; and nothing
had transpired to interrupt our felicity. A boy had
blest our union&mdash;and I was as happy as a husband
and father could possibly be. My health was almost
completely re-established; and my habits were
regular and domestic. I loathed the idea of those
exciting pleasures and feverish enjoyments in the
vortex of which I had nearly wrecked everything&mdash;health,
fortune, and reputation; and Mrs. Greville,
who dwelt with us, would often assure me with
a smile that I was the very pattern of good husbands.
My brother, who had become a magistrate,
was a frequent visitor at our house; and all was
progressing in peace, comfort, and tranquillity,
when an incident suddenly occurred to interfere
with that smiling prospect.</p>

<p>“It was late one evening, shortly after my beloved
Editha’s recovery from her confinement, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
I was informed that a person who refused to give
his name desired to speak with me in private. I
ordered the servant to show him into the library;
and thither I immediately afterwards proceeded.
The man whom I encountered there was a short,
thick-set fellow, with a forbidding countenance: he
was flashily dressed, and had about him an air of
jaunty impudence as if he had come upon some evil
mission in which he knew that he should succeed. I
asked him his business, without inviting him to be
seated&mdash;for I conceived a dislike to him the instant
I set eyes upon his sinister features. ‘Your
name is Macdonald?’ he said, flinging himself into
a chair in a very free-and-easy manner.&mdash;‘There is
no necessity for you to acquaint me with that fact,’
I observed, assuming as chilling a tone as possible.&mdash;‘Oh!
but there is, though!’ he ejaculated: ‘because
I must make sure that I am speaking to the
right person. Well, you admit your name: now
will you tell me whether you’re the gentleman that
married Miss Editha Greville?’&mdash;‘What means this
impudence?’ I demanded angrily. ‘Explain your
business, sir, without farther circumlocution.’&mdash;‘I’ll
come to the point in a minute,’ returned the
man, quite unabashed. ‘Fifteen or sixteen months
ago you used to visit a certain gentleman who lives
not a hundred miles from Soho Square.’&mdash;I started
and turned pale: for it struck me in a moment that
the fellow was alluding to the <em>consulting-surgeon</em>.&mdash;‘Well,
now I see that it’s all right,’ he exclaimed,
doubtless drawing this inference from the confusion
of my manner. ‘Of course you would rather it
shouldn’t be known that you <em>did</em> visit the gentleman,’
he added emphatically.&mdash;‘I do not understand your
meaning,’ I replied.&mdash;‘Look here, then,’ continued
the fellow: ‘it would not be very pleasant to have
your brother, your mother-in-law, your friends, your
tradesmen, your servants, and even your wife, made
acquainted with the fact that you were under Mr.
Surtees for some time previous to your marriage.’&mdash;‘I
never visited him but twice!’ were the words
that I gasped out, for horrible sensations were coming
rapidly over me.&mdash;‘Never mind how often it
was,’ cried the man, in a brutal tone: ‘you did call
to consult him, and that’s enough for me. Now
then, ’tis for you to say how much you’ll give me to
keep the secret.’&mdash;‘Wretch! extortioner!’ I ejaculated,
rage succeeding alarm in my breast&mdash;‘It’s of
no use to attempt to bully me,’ said the ruffian,
with the most cold-blooded composure: ‘I want
money, and I mean to get it out of you.’&mdash;‘Or else?’
I said, all my wretched feelings returning, as I saw
myself threatened with exposure, shame, and irretrievable
degradation.&mdash;‘Or else,’ he repeated, ‘I
shall tell the secret to all the people I have named;
and then we shall see whether you will ever hold
up your head in society again.’&mdash;‘And how much
money do you require?’ I asked, my heart sinking
within me.&mdash;‘Five hundred will do for the present,’
he responded imperiously.&mdash;‘For the present?’ I
cried, echoing his words: ‘what! do you mean to
visit me again for such a purpose?’&mdash;‘Not if you
shell out at once, and without making any more
words about it,’ he said.&mdash;There was no alternative
save to comply; and I accordingly counted into his
hand the Bank-notes for the sum named. In
another minute he had taken his departure&mdash;and I
was left alone to meditate upon the scene that had
just occurred.</p>

<p>“It was a long time before I could so far compose
my countenance and my feelings as to be able to return
to the parlour without exciting the suspicions
of my wife and mother-in-law that something unpleasant
had taken place. But I managed to conceal
the sorrow which the event of the evening had
engendered within me; and early on the following
morning I paid a visit to Mr. Surtees. He did not
appear at first to recollect me&mdash;or, at all events, if
he did, he was a wonderful adept in playing the
part of forgetfulness: but when I mentioned my
name, he exclaimed, ‘Vy, is it possible that you’ve
come back to consult me again?’&mdash;‘Far from it,’ I
answered, with a bitterness which I could not hide,
and which he failed not to notice; for he bit his
lip, and coloured deeply. I then related to him
the particulars of the visit I had received on the
previous evening, and accused him of being the
prime mover in the matter. But he repelled the
charge with so much indignation&mdash;whether real or
feigned I cannot even now determine&mdash;that I certainly
believed him at the time; and, were I at
present writing for the purpose of having my narrative
read by the world, I should be loth indeed to
have it inferred that Mr. Surtees was in reality mixed
up with the case of extortion. Much as I hate and despise
him, I will not do him a wanton injustice; and I
am therefore bound to state that he was warm and
energetic in his assurances of complete innocence respecting
the transaction.&mdash;‘But how could the man
have known that I ever <em>did</em> visit you?’ I asked.&mdash;‘Vell
things does get abroad in a many most unaccountable
vays,’ he responded: ‘but I take my Gosh to witness
that I’m as clear of this business as the babe
vot’s unborn. Vot can I do to conwince you that
such is the fect?’&mdash;‘I do not entertain such a dreadful
opinion of human nature as to disbelieve you,
sir,’ was my rejoinder; and I took my leave. But,
distressed and harassed as I was, I could not help
noticing the strong and disagreeable odour of fried
fish that came up from the lower regions of the
dwelling: nor could I avoid a smile as I caught a
glimpse of Mrs. Surtees, who was running hastily
up stairs, having evidently emerged from the kitchen&mdash;for
her swarthy countenance was as greasy as it
could be, and her appearance was dirty and slovenly
in the extreme. Yet, a few hours later in the
day, this woman would doubtless turn out in all
the flaunting gaud of her rainbow attire and in the
profuse display of her costly jewellery!</p>

<p>“I must again repeat that I quitted Mr. Surtees’
abode with the conviction that he was anything but
an accomplice in the scheme of extortion; and I
said to myself, as I returned homeward, ‘The scene
of last night is one of those penalties which we are
doomed to pay for the irregularities and evil courses
of our youthful years. But, even though Surtees himself
be innocent, is not the extortionate deed all the
same a result of an infamous system of quackery?
Destroy that system&mdash;and the quietude of men’s
homes could not thus be troubled by the visits of
extortioners!’&mdash;By degrees my mind grew calmer;
and as weeks and months fled away, I had almost
ceased to think of the occurrence which had so
much ruffled me, when one evening the man reappeared
at the house. Again was the ominous
message delivered to me while I was seated in the
society of my beloved wife and her excellent mother&mdash;again
did I see the man in private&mdash;and again
was I compelled to endure his cool insolence and
yield to his extortionate demands. Another five
hundred pounds was transferred from my pocket
to his own;&mdash;and once more was I forced to veil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
the real condition of my feelings when I rejoined
the ladies in the parlour. And now, as time slipped
away, I did not lose the misgivings that this second
visit had excited in my mind&mdash;I could not forget
that I was in the power of a villain, who was certain
to come back again. Months passed; and a third time&mdash;I
remember it well&mdash;it was on Christmas eve,&mdash;the
fatal message was delivered to me. On this occasion I
started so violently and betrayed so much confusion
that both my wife and mother-in-law observed my
agitation. I however hurried away, without responding
to their anxious enquiries; and when once
more in the presence of the extortioner, I heaped
the bitterest reproaches upon him. He heard me
with a coolness and a self-possession that only augmented
my wrath; and at length I ceased speaking
through sheer exhaustion. He then informed me,
in his imperious and rude manner, that he had an
opportunity of emigrating under the most favourable
services&mdash;that he required a thousand pounds&mdash;and
that if I gave him this sum, he would never
trouble me again. I bound him by the most solemn
oaths to that pledge; and, to save myself from a
shame that would have crushed me down to the
very dust and rendered life intolerable, I gave the
miscreant a cheque on my bankers for the large
amount which he demanded. But on my return to
the company of my Editha and Mrs. Greville, I was
compelled to invent falsehoods to account for my
confusion; and I beheld, with pain and bitter grief,
that they both saw that I was deceiving them&mdash;that
I was concealing the real truth&mdash;and that there was
something upon my mind!<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;and they conjectured truly; for my
peace was now so thoroughly disturbed, that I despaired
of regaining it. I felt convinced that, in
spite of the villain’s solemn vows, he would come
back again; and I dreaded to be at home&mdash;for
every knock at the door made me start nervously.
If I walked or rode out, on my return I dreaded
lest the servants should inform me that a certain
person had called for me during my absence, and
would look in again in the evening. Thus my
life became a veritable burthen to me; and my
sorrow was aggravated by the stern necessity of
retaining it all in my own breast. Often and often
did I think of inventing some excuse to induce my
wife and her mother to consent that we should
break up our establishment in London, and repair
to the continent. But what apology could I devise
for such a strange proceeding?&mdash;and, moreover,
would not the extortioner find me out, if he set
himself to the work? because to imagine any feasible
ground for changing our name, was impossible.
Thus months passed away, without seeing me determine
upon any plan to frustrate the extortioner
should he return; and I saw that my Editha’s
health and spirits began to fail&mdash;because she knew
that I was secretly unhappy!</p>

<p>“And the extortioner <em>did</em> come back: and again
was I forced to yield to his demands. Two thousand
pounds did he obtain from me on this occasion;
and when I reminded him of his solemn pledges
and sacred vows, he laughed outright in my face.
Oh! how I hated&mdash;abhorred&mdash;loathed that man! I
could have slain him on the spot: but I thought of
my dear wife and innocent boy, and I restrained my
hand. And now my mind became seriously unsettled&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
painful nervousness constantly maintained
its influence over me&mdash;my health gave way
again, as rapidly under the heavy weight of sorrow
as it did beneath the wearing effects of dissipation.
Oh! yes&mdash;and what was worse than all, was that
my Editha grew paler and thinner day by day&mdash;visibly;&mdash;and
I dared not attempt to console her&mdash;I could
not force my tongue to frame a lie to assure
her that I myself was happy. Thus was our once
happy home changed to a scene of gloom: a deep
despondency hung upon us all&mdash;and I perceived,
with ineffable anguish, that Mrs. Greville began to
view me with distrust. Perhaps she thought that
some crime lay heavy upon my soul: yes&mdash;this
must have been her impression&mdash;or she would
doubtless have questioned me. But she did not
live long enough to behold the sad catastrophe: a
short though severe illness snatched her to the
tomb&mdash;and, circumstanced as I was, I rejoiced in
secret at the event,&mdash;for I said to myself, ‘There is
at all events one being the less to deceive&mdash;one
being the less to watch me with mournful and
silently appealing looks!’&mdash;O God! It was not
strange&mdash;it was not wonderful if madness were
beginning even then to undermine the strong tower
of my reason!</p>

<p>“Scarcely were the remains of my mother-in-law
consigned to the tomb, when the extortioner reappeared
at the house. His demands increased in
proportion to the concessions which were made to
him by my fears; but I was totally unable to comply
with his present exigences. It is true that there
was much property still left;&mdash;but it was settled
on my wife&mdash;and I could not command from my own
resources the sum needed. This I candidly told
him, and besought him to be merciful;&mdash;yes, with
tears in my eyes did I beseech him. The wretch!
the monster! what cared he for my grief&mdash;my
anguish? He desired me to have recourse to a discounter&mdash;gave
me the address of a money-lender&mdash;and
said he should return on the following evening.
Accordingly&mdash;impelled by my wretched, wretched
destiny&mdash;I visited the money-lender, who advanced
me three thousand pounds on my own acceptance, and
at most usurious interest. The whole of that money
found its way into the pocket of the extortioner;
and when he had taken his departure, I fell down in
a fit. For days and days did I keep my bed; and when
I awoke to consciousness, it was from a delirium.
My dear wife was seated by my bed-side; but,
O God!&mdash;how pale&mdash;how altered&mdash;how wan she was
with long vigils and deep grief! I questioned her
guardedly to ascertain whether in my ravings I had
betrayed my secret: but I learnt, beyond all doubt,
that I had <em>not</em>. Then I began to breathe more
freely; and she, throwing her arms about my neck,
exclaimed, while tears streamed in torrents down
her cheeks, ‘My beloved husband, you have some
dreadful grief preying upon your mind. May I not
be made your confidant? I have observed that always
after the visits of the man who calls every
now and then, and invariably in the evening, you
are stricken as with a heavy affliction. Oh! what
does it all mean?&mdash;I endeavoured to console her&mdash;to
soothe her&mdash;to reassure her as well as I could;
but I saw that she only pretended to be solaced, for
my sake!</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I recovered: but happiness and I had
shaken hands for ever. I felt as if I were followed
about by an invisible demon, whose breath poisoned
the very atmosphere that I breathed. I know that my
brain was reeling&mdash;that my reason was tottering
that I was going mad! Often did I think seriously
of murdering my wife and child, and
putting an end to my own existence. But I dared
not lay violent hands upon <em>them</em>; and I had too
much moral courage still left to seek death so long
as there remained a single tie, however feeble, to
bind me to life. But a new misfortune was in store
for me&mdash;for <em>us</em>. A solicitor in whom I and my wife
trusted, obtained our signatures to certain deeds
under the foulest representations; and by virtue
thereof he sold out all the stock standing in Editha’s
name in the Bank. He then absconded; and we
were suddenly reduced from affluence to comparative
penury. I was unable to honour my acceptance;
and the discounter would listen to no terms.
He said that he had passed it away in the regular
course of business, and could not take it up himself.
I was arrested and thrown into prison. My
friends deserted me, believing that wanton
extravagance on my part had led to this
catastrophe. Yes: all save my beloved wife
deserted me&mdash;and she, the angel! remained
faithful to me! We had two hundred and
fifty pounds a year still left; and on the houses
which produced this income, my wife insisted on
raising the money necessary to obtain my release.
But such a proceeding would have left us beggars;
and I could not endure the idea of misery for one&mdash;two&mdash;three
persons! No: the property was so
secured that my creditor could not touch it&mdash;and
I resolved, by the advice of an attorney, to apply for
relief to the Insolvents’ Court. I did so; and the
creditor opposed me on the ground of extravagance.
I could give no account of the manner in which I
had disposed of the money he had advanced me&mdash;and
when the opposing counsel asked me, on my
oath, whether I had not lost it at gambling, I greedily
snapped at the means of explanation thus furnished,
and perjured myself by the utterance of an
affirmative. Oh! that miscreant extortioner!&mdash;he
drove me to ruin&mdash;a prison&mdash;the Insolvents’ Court&mdash;perjury&mdash;and
lastly to a mad-house! Great God!
how can I write thus tranquilly when I think of
all the wrongs that I have endured?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="author">
“<em>July 23rd, 1846.</em><br />
</p>

<p>“I have been compelled to desist again: but at
length I resume my pen. My ideas are rapidly
becoming more settled: I think that I shall recover
altogether, if I can but manage to escape from this
place!</p>

<p>“I stated that I appeared at the Insolvents’
Court, and was opposed by the holder of the bill
for three thousand pounds. The Commissioner remanded
me to prison for twelve months as a punishment
for wanton and profligate expenditure. I
shall not dwell upon that long incarceration: it
was horrible to a sensitive soul like mine. Even
Editha, patient and loving as she was, failed to
solace me altogether. There were intervals of
anguish so bitter that I fancied myself at times to
be already dead and enduring the torments of hell.
Dreadful thought! But at length the time passed&mdash;and
I was once more free. We took a neat little
cottage in the suburbs of the metropolis; and tranquility
seemed to have been restored to us at last.
Our son throve gloriously: Oh! what a handsome
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
boy he became&mdash;what a handsome boy he must be
now! Nearly two yeas passed&mdash;and I was recovering
my mental serenity, when one day I met the
extortioner in the street. Oh! what a cold shudder
came over me as I saw his eyes fixed upon me! It
seemed as if a horrible spectre had suddenly started
up from the earth to horrify and appal me. I beheld
<em>Ruin</em> personified; and a faintness came over
me. But I was recalled to a poignant sense of my
misery by the well-known voice, that fell upon my
ears, making fresh demands upon my purse. I took
the man into an obscure public-house close by; and,
as there was no one in the room save ourselves at
the time, we could converse freely upon the business.
Freely, indeed! when every word he uttered fell
like drops of molten lead upon my heart&mdash;and every
syllable I breathed in return hissed from my parched
tongue like water passing over red hot iron! What
could I do? The fiend insisted upon having money,
and swore that he would follow me home. He,
however, measured his demands to my means, and
insisted upon having three hundred pounds by a
given hour the next evening. We parted&mdash;and I
saw that he dogged me: indeed, he did not attempt
to conceal himself nor his intentions as he followed
me until I entered my own door&mdash;and I knew that
it was useless either to turn upon him in a hostile
manner, or to attempt to baffle his aim.</p>

<div id="i_345" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_345.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Heaven only knows how I contrived to explain
to my wife the reason of my altered appearance&mdash;or
rather, how I managed to conceal the real cause
beneath a falsehood. But I did succeed in reassuring
her somewhat; and on the following day I went
to the discounter&mdash;the same discounter who had
lent me money before&mdash;to ask him for a loan. It
was a desperate step, taken by a desperate man:
but, to my surprise, he consented without the
slightest hesitation to accommodate me. I received
the money&mdash;gave my note of hand&mdash;and paid the
amount to the extortioner. But things had now
reached a crisis with me&mdash;and I became so unsettled
in my mind that Editha was seriously alarmed.
I remember that my brother, the magistrate, was
sent for; and he visited the house after having been
long estranged from me. Then a mist came over
my memory; and, when I awoke, I was&mdash;here!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;here, where I now pen these lines! Oh!
I have been mad&mdash;raving mad; and Heaven knows
that I have endured enough to make me so. Such
persecution could only end in insanity. But I am
better now: nay&mdash;I am well&mdash;although my friends
will not believe it. My brother was here yesterday;
and I saw by the way in which he humoured
me when I told him I was fast recovering my reason,
that he still imagines me to be insane. I implored
him to let me see Editha and my boy: he
declared that I should have that pleasure next
Sunday. He likewise told me that they were well
in health, but deeply grieved on my account.</p>

<p>“Now I have made up my mind how to act. I
shall escape from this horrible place, and proceed to
France. There I shall adopt an assumed name&mdash;and
thence I shall write to Editha to join me at
once with our son. We shall be beyond the reach
of the extortioner&mdash;and tranquil, if not happy days
may yet await us. Yes&mdash;this is my hope! But shall
I destroy the manuscript upon which I have laboured
so arduously, and which has furnished me
with an occupation that has done me so much good?
No: I cannot consent to annihilate the papers
which contain a narrative so fraught with awful
warning. But does it not likewise contain my
secret?&mdash;and is not my name mentioned in the
course of the recital? Hark! footsteps approach&mdash;I
must conceal my papers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CLXXXIX">CHAPTER CLXXXIX.<br />

<span class="medium">SCENES IN THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.</span></h2>

<p>Thus terminated the extraordinary manuscript
which Lord William Trevelyan found in the wardrobe,
and the perusal of which occupied him nearly
two hours.</p>

<p>He was undecided how to dispose of the papers.
Should he return them to the place where they had
been concealed?&mdash;should he destroy them?&mdash;should
he take them away with him, in the hope of being
one day enabled to discover their writer, and by
restoring them to him convince him that they had
fallen into the possession of an honourable man,
who, though having had the curiosity to read them,
would, nevertheless, religiously keep the secret
which they contained?</p>

<p>For, from the abrupt termination of the manuscript,
Lord William very naturally concluded that
the unfortunate author had succeeded in effecting
his escape from the lunatic-asylum very shortly
after he had penned the last words in the narrative;
and the young nobleman, therefore, considered it to
be possible, though perhaps not very probable, that
he might sooner or later encounter Mr. Macdonald
in the great and busy world.</p>

<p>Lord William had likewise another motive for
retaining the papers.</p>

<p>The reader has seen enough of him to be aware
that there was in his disposition much of the same
chivalrous spirit and philanthropic principle which
characterised the Earl of Ellingham; and it was
therefore natural that he should become suddenly
impressed with the idea of adopting measures, in
due course, for the purpose of fully exposing the
atrocious system of quackery that was carried on
by pseudo-medical advertisers.</p>

<p>He remembered that the newspapers contained
many advertisements announcing such works as the
one which had proved the means of ensnaring the
unfortunate Mr. Macdonald; and he was resolved
to lose no time in employing his solicitor to institute
all the necessary inquiries into the characters,
histories, proceedings, and social positions of
the scoundrels who thus accumulated large fortunes
by means of the most atrocious quackery,
deceit, rascality, and extortion.</p>

<p>The manuscript which chance had this night
thrown in his way, contained so many important
particulars, and furnished such a complete clue to
the entire ramifications of the dark iniquity which
the young nobleman was determined to expose, that
he regarded it as a powerful auxiliary to the crusade
he was about to undertake; and this consideration,
added to the motives already mentioned, decided him
in retaining possession of the document.</p>

<p>It was now one o’clock in the morning; and a
profound silence reigned throughout the lunatic
asylum.</p>

<p>Lord William noiselessly opened the door of his
chamber, and looked forth into the long passage,
which was partially lighted by a single lamp that
had been left burning.</p>

<p>No living being was to be seen; and nothing disturbed
the dead stillness of the hour and the place.</p>

<p>It now struck the young nobleman that the door
of the chamber which he was anxious to enter&mdash;namely,
No. 12, in the same passage as his own
apartment&mdash;was most probably locked; and, in this
case, he made up his mind to force it at all risks.</p>

<p>A little farther reflection suggested to him that,
inasmuch as he had seen the housekeeper with only
a single key in her hand, it was probable that this
key was a pass to all the chambers; and he thence
inferred that the key of his own room might
perhaps fit the lock of the door belonging to
No. 12.</p>

<p>At all events this was the first experiment that
he resolved to try; and, without any longer delay,
he proceeded as cautiously as possible down the
passage, until he reached the chamber which he
hoped and believed to be the one occupied by his
friend.</p>

<p>There was a bolt outside the door: this was
immediately drawn back;&mdash;and Trevelyan essayed
the key.</p>

<p>To his indescribable joy, the key turned easily in
the lock; and, with a beating heart, the nobleman
entered the room&mdash;closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>The chamber was quite dark: but Trevelyan
speedily groped his way to the window and drew
aside the curtains, so as to permit the powerful
moonlight to pour its silver flood into the room.</p>

<p>He now approached the bed&mdash;and there, to his
delight, he beheld the well-known, though worn
and wasted, countenance of his friend Sir Gilbert
Heathcote, who was wrapped in slumber.</p>

<p>Lord William shook him gently; the baronet
awoke with a sudden start and ejaculation; but at
the same instant a friendly voice said, hurriedly,
“Fear nothing! ’tis I&mdash;Trevelyan&mdash;and I am come
to deliver you from this accursed place.”</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert, who had raised his head from the
pillow, fell back again, and closed his eyes for a
few moments. He fancied that he was dreaming.
He could not believe that those welcome words had
in reality sounded in his ears, or that the moonlight
had shown him the form of his friend by the bed-side.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span></p>

<p>Trevelyan did not choose to interrupt the baronet’s
reverie immediately; he comprehended the
prudence of allowing him to collect his scattered
ideas, and compose his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Is it really you, my dear young friend?” Sir
Gilbert asked abruptly; and, starting up in the
bed, he seized Trevelyan’s hand, and gazed fixedly
upon his countenance.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is no dream,” responded Lord William,
pressing the baronet’s hand with all the fervour of
his generous friendship; “I am here to effect your
escape, and there is no time to be lost.”</p>

<p>Still the baronet could scarcely believe the joyful
announcement thus made to him; and Trevelyan,
duly impressed with the necessity of tranquilising
and reassuring his friend’s mind as much as
possible ere the attempt at departure should be
made,&mdash;fearing likewise that the baronet’s intellect
had been somewhat impaired by the sense of
wrong and the horrors of imprisonment in a lunatic
asylum,&mdash;began to speak upon such topics
as were calculated to direct his thoughts into
a salutary channel.</p>

<p>“My dear Heathcote,” he said, “endeavour to
call to your aid as much calmness and self-possession
as possible; for a single inadvertence or
false step may ruin our project by alarming the
house. Remember that the place is as well protected
and defended, and probably as well watched,
as a gaol: and we must proceed with caution&mdash;courage&mdash;and
coolness.”</p>

<p>“But how did you find your way into the establishment?”
enquired Sir Gilbert, his ideas becoming
more settled.</p>

<p>“By pretending to be insane,” answered Trevelyan;
“and I have succeeded in thoroughly
duping the Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my generous&mdash;my noble-hearted friend!”
exclaimed the baronet: “how can I ever sufficiently
prove my gratitude&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! speak not with excitement!” interrupted
Trevelyan. “I am only doing towards you what
you would unhesitatingly perform for me under the
same circumstances. And now&mdash;as I am anxious
to relieve your mind as much as possible from any
uneasiness or suspense that it may experience&mdash;I
must at once inform you that Mrs. Sefton is in good
health, and at this moment in the happy expectation
of shortly seeing you again; for she is aware
of the scheme which I have adopted to restore you
to liberty.”</p>

<p>“Heaven be thanked for these assurances!” exclaimed
Sir Gilbert: then, after a few moments’
pause, he said, “I need scarcely ask you to explain
how you became acquainted with Mrs. Sefton. She
was no stranger to the friendship subsisting between
you and me&mdash;and I therefore conclude that, alarmed
by my sudden and inexplicable disappearance, she
sought your counsel and assistance.”</p>

<p>“All has occurred precisely as you conjecture,”
answered Trevelyan. “But do you now feel equal
to the task&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of making an effort to recover my freedom?”
ejaculated Sir Gilbert, leaping from the couch.
“Let us not lose another moment! The atmosphere
of this place seems oppressive, and heavy to breathe.
I pant&mdash;I yearn&mdash;I long for liberty.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the baronet began hastily to put
on his attire, and in a few minutes he was dressed.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Trevelyan, “we must decide upon
the course to be adopted. Doubtless there is a
porter to keep watch all night in the hall?” he
added, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Sir Gilbert: “and I am also
certain that a man patrols the garden. Besides,
the keepers inside the house are as wakeful and as
watchful as the fiends of Pandemonium; and the
least noise will bring half-a-dozen strong and desperate
fellows upon us. For my part, I have not the
slightest objection to embrace the alternative of
fighting our way through all opposition&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But the consequences of defeat would be most
disastrous,” interrupted Trevelyan. “The Doctor
would thereby gain an excuse for coercing both you
and me; and although I am as it were my own prisoner,
yet I have sworn not to quit these walls unless
accompanied by you.”</p>

<p>“Generous friend!” exclaimed Sir Gilbert.
“Were we well armed, we might bid defiance to
the Doctor and all his gang: but weaponless&mdash;powerless
as we are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do not despond, Heathcote,” said Trevelyan,
observing that the baronet spoke in a mournful
tone: “the task that I have undertaken, I will accomplish!
There appear to me to be two modes
of procedure. The first is to descend as noiselessly
as possible to the hall&mdash;seize upon the porter&mdash;master
him&mdash;and then effect our escape by the
front-door. The other is to force away the bars
from the window of this room&mdash;make a rope of the
bed-clothing&mdash;descend into the garden&mdash;and take
our chance with the watchman. Either project is
attended with the risk of creating an alarm:
but it is for you to decide, from your knowledge of
the premises and the habits of its inmates, which
scheme is the more feasible.”</p>

<p>“The former,” responded Sir Gilbert, after a few
moments’ deep reflection. “The watchman in the
garden would probably observe us at the window,
removing the bars; and an alarm would thus be
raised even before we were prepared to attempt an
escape by those means. On the other hand, the
porter sleeps in the hall:&mdash;of <em>this</em> fact I am well assured,
because I saw the bed temporarily made up
for him there on the night that I was brought
hither:&mdash;therefore our chances of success lie in that
direction.”</p>

<p>“Such also is my idea,” observed Trevelyan. “Let
us proceed at once&mdash;and permit me to take the
lead.”</p>

<p>The young nobleman and the baronet stole cautiously
forth from the chamber, treading so lightly
that their steps raised not a sound to disturb the
silence which prevailed throughout the establishment.</p>

<p>They descended to the first floor in safety: and
there they paused for a few minutes on the landing,
listening with suspended breath.</p>

<p>The deep and regular respiration of the porter
now reached their ears from the hall below; and
they thus obtained the assurance that the man
slumbered.</p>

<p>Exchanging looks of satisfaction, they descended
the last flight of stairs;&mdash;and, by the hall lamp, they
perceived the porter comfortably ensconced in a
truckle-bed that was made up for him in a convenient
corner. The light fell on his rubicund
countenance, which was surmounted by a cotton
nightcap: but the brawny arm that lay outside the
coverlid, and the tracing of his form as shaped by
the bed-clothes, showed full well that he was a man
of herculean stature and proportionate strength.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span></p>

<p>Nothing daunted&mdash;but resolving upon a desperate
effort to accomplish the purpose he had in view&mdash;Lord
William Trevelyan led the way into the hall;
and he had just ascertained the fact that there was
a bunch of large keys peeping forth from beneath
the sleeping porter’s pillow, when the door of the
supper-room suddenly opened, and Mr. Sheepshanks
staggered forth.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman carried a candle in his
hand; and, by his flushed countenance, vacant stare,
and unsteady walk, he was evidently in a pretty advanced
state of intoxication. In fact&mdash;and there is
no necessity to disguise the matter&mdash;the pious
minister had sate up to enjoy himself alone; and he
had carried his libations to such an extent that he
was now, at two o’clock in the morning, most
awfully drunk.</p>

<p>The moment Lord William caught sight of the
inebriate minister, he sprang upon him&mdash;placed his
hand tightly over his mouth&mdash;and, thrusting him
back into the supper-room, said in a low but hasty
and threatening tone, “Move hence at your peril!”</p>

<p>He then closed and locked the door.</p>

<p>But in the short and decided scuffle an untoward
accident had occurred.</p>

<p>The candlestick had dropped from Mr. Sheepshanks’
hand on the marble floor of the hall; and
the consequence was that the porter sprang up, and
was out of bed in a trice.</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Heathcote rushed upon him: but not
in time to prevent the man from springing a huge
rattle and crying, “Help! help!”</p>

<p>Lord William Trevelyan hesitated not a moment
how to act. He darted to the truckle-bed&mdash;seized
the keys from beneath the pillow&mdash;and sprang to
the door, leaving Sir Gilbert Heathcote wrestling
desperately with the porter.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that there were two
doors; and the young nobleman had only just time
to open the first or inner one, when a rapid glance
cast behind showed him his friend Sir Gilbert upon
the floor, completely overpowered by the huge
porter, who had placed his knee upon the baronet’s
chest.</p>

<p>It was Trevelyan’s hope that his friend would
have been able to keep the porter engaged in the
struggle until he could have opened both the doors,
when he would have turned to the scene of strife,
to rescue the baronet; but scarcely had he observed
that Sir Gilbert was already vanquished, when four
of the keepers rushed down stairs into the hall.</p>

<p>With the rapidity and force of a tiger springing
upon its prey, Lord William rushed on the huge
porter, hurled him to a distance, and raised up the
prostrate baronet.</p>

<p>All this was the work of an instant: but in
another moment the keepers sprang upon the two
friends, and closed with them.</p>

<p>The baronet was again borne down; but Trevelyan,
who now saw that the conflict was really becoming
desperate, used the bunch of heavy door-keys
with such effect that he speedily disabled the
two keepers who had assailed him,&mdash;stretching one
senseless on the floor, and compelling the other to
beat a retreat with the blood pouring down his
face.</p>

<p>To turn his attention to the two men who were
dragging away Sir Gilbert Heathcote, was the intrepid
young nobleman’s next step; and in a few
moments the baronet, once more rescued from the
enemy, was by the side of his intrepid friend.</p>

<p>“Take the keys and open the front door!” cried
Trevelyan, impetuously pushing Sir Gilbert towards
that extremity of the hall where the means of egress
lay. “Escape, in the name of heaven!&mdash;think not
of me!”</p>

<p>And having thrust the keys into his friend’s hand,
Lord William seized the Doctor’s gold-headed cane,
which hung to a hat-peg in the hall; and placing
himself between the front-door and the keepers, he
cried, “Beware how you provoke me&mdash;for I shall
not hesitate to defend myself to the death!”</p>

<p>But scarcely were these words uttered, when the
two keepers from whom he had rescued the baronet,
returned to the charge, aided by the burly
porter.</p>

<p>The foremost was instantaneously felled by a
blow vigorously dealt with the cane; and, following
up his advantage quickly as the eye can wink, Trevelyan
darted at the other keeper, whom he also
levelled on the spot. But in the next moment the
gallant young nobleman was in the grasp of the
porter; and, dropping the cane as no longer useful
in a close tussle, he addressed himself with all
his might to this last and most desperate single
combat.</p>

<p>The scene was very exciting; and all that we
have yet described since the first moment that the
conflict commenced, did not occupy more than two
minutes.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the intrepid nobleman and the herculean
porter closed together, when the Doctor,
attired in his dressing-gown and slippers, and with
his cotton night-cap on his head, appeared at the
bottom of the stairs, holding a chamber-candle in
his hand.</p>

<p>At the same instant Sir Gilbert Heathcote had
succeeded in opening the front door; and the morning
breeze poured into the hall, in a manner doubtless
highly refreshing to the porter, who, be it
remembered, had nothing on but his shirt&mdash;<em>his</em> cap
having fallen off in the conflict which he had maintained
with the baronet in the first instance.</p>

<p>Two of the discomfited keepers, animated by the
presence of the Doctor&mdash;or perhaps rendered
ashamed of their pusillanimity&mdash;now returned to
the attack upon Trevelyan, who was just on the
point of hurling the porter to the ground. But Sir
Gilbert, having made the entrance free, rushed back
to help his friend; and the contest was again renewed
with desperate energy,&mdash;the other two
keepers, who had by this time recovered their
senses, joining in the struggle.</p>

<p>And hard would it have gone with Trevelyan and
the baronet against such odds, had not two new-comers
suddenly appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>For, the front door standing wide open, and the
lamp being alight in the hall, two gentlemen who
were passing by the house at the time beheld the
extraordinary proceedings that were taking place
within; and the foremost, perceiving in an instant
that the odds were two to five,&mdash;namely, Trevelyan
and the baronet against the four keepers and the
porter,&mdash;exclaimed at the top of a stentorian voice,
“Be Jasus! Frank, and we’ll just give a helping
hand to the waker side!”</p>

<p>With these words, the redoubtable Captain
O’Blunderbuss&mdash;nerved with all the courage attributed
by Sir Walter Scott to Lord Marmion&mdash;“plunged
into the fight.”</p>

<p>Or, in less poetical language, he darted into the
hall&mdash;levelled the herculean porter with a well-directed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
blow between the eyes&mdash;and sent a couple
of keepers sprawling over the aforesaid porter in
an instant.</p>

<p>Frank Curtis, having imbibed just sufficient poteen
to subdue his habitual cowardice and arm him with
the bastard though not the less effectual valour
which strong drink inspires, unhesitatingly followed
the example of his gallant leader, and bore his part
in the fray; so that in less than a minute a complete
diversion was effected in favour of Lord
William Trevelyan and Sir Gilbert Heathcote, the
enemy being utterly discomfited.</p>

<p>“Villains! murderers! robbers!” shouted the
infuriate Doctor, as loud as he could bawl; and
then the screams and shrieks of the affrighted
female servants were heard echoing from the stairs
and landing-places.</p>

<p>“Let us depart!” cried Lord William Trevelyan;
and, in a very few moments, he pushed the baronet,
the captain, and Frank Curtis, out of the front
door,&mdash;he himself pausing only for a single second
to secure the keys.</p>

<p>In another instant he was outside the house;
and closing the door behind him, he locked it so as
to prevent the Doctor and his myrmidons from instituting
an immediate pursuit.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and this is the rummest lar-r-k I iver
had in all my life!” ejaculated Captain O’Blunderbuss,
panting for breath.</p>

<p>“Come with us, gentlemen,” said Lord William,
hastily addressing that gallant officer and Frank
Curtis: “you have rendered us a signal service&mdash;and
we must know you better. We have likewise
certain necessary explanations to give you relative
to the strange scene in which you took so generous
a part. But come away directly&mdash;there is not a
moment to be lost&mdash;a hue and cry may be raised!”</p>

<p>“Be the power-rs! and is it bur-r-glars ye are?”
cried the Captain, somewhat regretting the precipitation
with which he had mixed himself up in the
late affray.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no: far from <em>that</em>!” exclaimed Lord William,
laughing heartily at the idea. “But let us
get as quickly as we can out of this neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>And away the four gentlemen scampered into
the Cambridge Road, down which they sped until
they reached Mile End, where they fortunately
found a night-cab waiting for a fare.</p>

<p>Into the vehicle they got; and Lord William
Trevelyan exclaimed, as an instruction to the
driver, “Park Square, Regent’s Park!”</p>

<p>Away the cab went; and both Captain O’Blunderbuss
and Frank Curtis, who had heard the aristocratic
address thus given, were seized with an
insatiable curiosity to learn who their new acquaintances
could be.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXC">CHAPTER CXC.<br />

<span class="medium">A SCENE IN A CAB.</span></h2>

<p>“Ginthlemen,” exclaimed the gallant Irishman,
“I mane to inthroduce myself and frind to ye
without any more bother or pother. My frind,
then, ginthlemen, is Misther Frank Cur-r-tis&mdash;discinded
from a fine family, and once possissed of
large estates, all of which, be Jasus! he’s managed
to ate up as clane as if dirthy acres were plum-pudding.
My name, ginthlemen, is Capthain
O’Bluntherbuss, of Bluntherbuss Park, Connemar-r-ra&mdash;where
I shall be delighted to see ye any time
ye may be afther visiting Ould Ireland and I’m at
home.”</p>

<p>“Permit me to shake hands with you, Captain
O’Blunderbuss,” said the young nobleman; “and
with you also, Mr. Curtis. You have rendered me
and my friend a service which we cannot easily
forget.”</p>

<p>“And which we shall never seek to forget,”
added the baronet, emphatically; and then there
was a general shaking of hands inside the cab.</p>

<p>Lord William Trevelyan next proceeded to inform
his new friends who he and Sir Gilbert Heathcote
were; and the reader may conceive the huge
delight experienced by Captain O’Blunderbuss and
Mr. Frank Curtis when they found themselves in
the company of a real nobleman and a real baronet.</p>

<p>“And now, my lor-r-d,” said the gallant officer,
“will ye be so obleeging as to explain to us what
house that was where all the pother took place,
and what was the maning of the pother itself: for,
be the holy poker-r! I can’t make head or tail of
it!”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” responded Lord William Trevelyan,
“it was a mad-house.”</p>

<p>“A mad-house!” ejaculated Mr. Frank Curtis,
starting as if stung by a serpent lurking in the
straw at the bottom of the cab&mdash;while a cold tremor
came over him; for it instantly struck him
that he and his Irish companion had been instrumental
in the escape of a couple of lunatics.</p>

<p>“A mad-house!” repeated the Captain, immediately
entertaining the same idea, although not
sharing the apprehensions of his friend.</p>

<p>“Neither more nor less,” continued Trevelyan,
perfectly unaware of the impression which his
words had produced upon the two gentlemen: for,
as the inside of the cab was quite dark, he could
not observe the change that took place in their
countenances.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you&mdash;don’t mean to&mdash;to&mdash;say,” stammered
Curtis, fidgetting uncommonly, and thrusting
his hand outside the window to grasp the handle
of the door: for he began to think that the sooner
he emancipated himself from the cab, the better;&mdash;“you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hould your tongue, ye spalpeen!” vociferated
the Captain, who, fully acquainted with the character
of his friend, guessed pretty accurately all
that was passing in his mind: for the worthy Irishman,
on his part, was determined not to separate
from his new friends, whether they were lunatics or
not, until he had ascertained if any thing was to
be got out of them either in the shape of money
or whiskey, or both;&mdash;“hould your tongue, ye spalpeen!
and let’s hear what his lor-rdship has to say
upon the matther.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I was informing you, gentlemen,” resumed
Trevelyan, who considered that a proper
explanation was fully due to those who had acted
such a gallant part in the late proceedings, “the
house whence you just now so effectually aided us
to escape, is a lunatic-asylum&mdash;and the men against
whom you fought were the keepers.”</p>

<p>“And who&mdash;who were the&mdash;the&mdash;lunatics?” asked
Frank Curtis, perspiring at every pore&mdash;for the effects
of the whiskey which he had been drinking
were completely absorbed in the terror that now
influenced him.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and I won’t have such questions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
put to my intimate frind his lor-r-dship, and my
parthicular frind the baronet!“ ejaculated Captain
O’Blunderbuss, bestowing upon Frank’s ribs such an
unmerciful nudge with his elbow that the gentleman
who was made the recipient of the said poke
writhed horribly in his seat. “Prosade, sir&mdash;my
lor-r-d, I mane,” added the gallant officer, who, in
spite of his civility towards the nobleman and the
baronet, firmly believed that they were lunatics, and
had usurped titles to which they had not the slightest
claim nor right.</p>

<p>“Your companion asked me who were the lunatics,”
said Trevelyan, beginning to be somewhat astonished
at the manner of his new friends: “well,
to tell you the candid truth, myself and Sir Gilbert
Heathcote were supposed to be&mdash;although I leave
you both to judge whether there could have been
the slightest ground for such an idea.”</p>

<p>“O Lord!&mdash;O Lord!” murmured Frank Curtis;
and again his hand, which he had withdrawn when
the captain nudged him, was thrust out of the window
to grasp the door-latch.</p>

<p>“Are you unwell, my dear sir?” inquired Sir
Gilbert Heathcote, in a tone of much concern&mdash;for,
being seated precisely opposite to Curtis, he had
heard the murmured ejaculations which had escaped
that individual’s lips.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;very,” replied Frank, with a hollow groan.</p>

<p>“Be asy, thin, can’t ye?” whispered the Captain
savagely in his ear, at the same time favouring him
with another barbarous nudge in the ribs. “Oh!
it’s nothln’ at all, at all, with my frind, I can assure
ye, my lor-r-d and Sir Gilbert,” exclaimed the
gallant officer aloud: “he’s throubled with whazing
in the throat when he’s been afther dhrinking an
exthra dhrop of potheen&mdash;and may be the motion
of the cab don’t quite agree with him, bad luck to
his nonsense! Well, my lor-r-d, ye were afther
telling us that your lor-r-dship’s ownself and Sir
Gilbert were belaved to be the lunatics?”</p>

<p>“Just so,” answered Trevelyan; “and had not
the affair proved a very serious one to my friend
Heathcote, I should be inclined to laugh at the ludicrous
manner in which it terminated. Heathcote
was immured in that asylum under most treacherous
circumstances a short time ago&mdash;although, I
need scarcely inform you, there was not the slightest
pretense for the imputation of insanity&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be the holy poker-r! and any one that’s blind
could see that same!” ejaculated Captain O’Blunderbuss.</p>

<p>“O Lord!” again moaned Frank Curtis; and he
slily and stealthily turned the handle of the cab
door.</p>

<p>“Determined to rescue my friend,” continued
Lord William Trevelyan, “I induced two medical
gentlemen, who are under some obligations to me,
and whom I admitted into my confidence, to sign
the necessary certificates to consign me to a lunatic
asylum&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“O Lord&mdash;O Lord!” groaned Curtis, more deeply
than before; for even if he had hitherto entertained
any doubt as to the state of Trevelyan’s mind, the
singular averment just made was quite sufficient to
confirm him in the opinion that he was in company
with a decided lunatic.</p>

<p>“What the divvel ails ye, man?” growled Captain
O’Blunderbuss. “Prosade, my lor-r-d. I’m
dapely intherested in your lor-rdship’s narrative.”</p>

<p>“Having thus obtained the certificates,” continued
Trevelyan, “I tutored my valet how to act&mdash;and
he accordingly consigned me to the care of
Dr. Swinton&mdash;the old gentleman whom you saw in
a dressing-gown and night-cap at the foot of the
stairs.”</p>

<p>“An arrant ould scounthrel, I’ve no doubt,”
interjected the Captain.</p>

<p>“It was necessary, under the circumstances,”
resumed Trevelyan, “to fight Sir Gilbert’s enemies
with their own weapons. Cunning against cunning&mdash;duplicity
against duplicity! That was the
plan I adopted; and I affected insanity so well,
that the Doctor was completely deceived.”</p>

<p>“Be the power-rs! this is excellent,” ejaculated
Captain O’Blunderbuss. “It’s not ivery one that
could desayve a mad-docthor so well.”</p>

<p>“I really believe that he imagined me to be as
mad as a March hare,” said Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“And so you are!” yelled forth Frank Curtis,
suddenly throwing the door wide open and making
a desperate attempt to leap from the cab, even at
the risk of breaking his neck or fracturing his skull&mdash;for
his terrors had risen to such a pitch that confinement
in the vehicle along with two persons
whom he firmly believed to be downright mad-men,
had become utterly unendurable:&mdash;but the iron
grasp of the Captain clutched him by the back part
of his collar just as he was on the point of bounding
franticly forth into the road&mdash;and he was compelled,
not however without a struggle, to resume
his seat.</p>

<p>This proceeding on the part of Frank Curtis suddenly
opened the eyes of both Trevelyan and the
baronet to the impressions which the recent proceedings
had unmistakeably and naturally made on
the minds of their new friends: as if a light had
darted in upon them, they now comprehended the
cause of Frank Curtis’s singular manner almost
ever since they first entered the vehicle;&mdash;and they
likewise perceived (though they did not rightly interpret)
the courtesy which had not only rendered
Captain O’Blunderbuss so good a listener to the
explanations given by Trevelyan, but had also
prompted him to silence and coerce his companion
as much as possible.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Trevelyan and Sir Gilbert Heathcote
simultaneously broke out into such a hearty
fit of laughter that Frank Curtis began to console
himself with the idea that they were at least harmless;
while Captain O’Blunderbuss set them down
as the merriest lunatics he had ever encountered in
all his life, and joined with unfeigned cordiality in
their glee.</p>

<p>“And so you really thought that we were mad?”
exclaimed Trevelyan, as soon as he could compose
himself sufficiently to speak.</p>

<p>“Oh! not at all, at all!” cried the Captain.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Curtis firmly believes that we are
neither more nor less than lunatics?” said the
young nobleman, enjoying the scene.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and if he darrs insulth your lor-rdship
and your lor-rdship’s frind by even suspicting
such a thing, he shall mate me to-morrow mornin’
at twelve paces on Wimbledon Common!” exclaimed
the gallant and warlike gentleman.</p>

<p>“Really you excite yourself too much in our behalf,
Captain,” observed Trevelyan, who saw plainly
enough that O’Blunderbuss was adopting just such
a tone and manner as one would use to conciliate
and soothe lunatics. “Now tell us the truth, my
dear sir,” continued the young nobleman: “do you
not think that if we are actually and positively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
crazy, you and Mr. Curtis cannot boast of being
perfectly sane?”</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! and that same is precisely what I’ve
often been afther thinking!” cried the Captain, determined
to humour the supposed lunatics as much
as possible. “As for Frank Curtis here, he’s as
mad as the Irish pig that wouldn’t go one particular
way save and excipt at such times that it belaved
it was being driv another. As for meself, bad
luck to me! I’m not blind to my own failings&mdash;and
I know purty well that I’m as cracked as any
damned ould laky tay-kettle.”</p>

<p>The accommodating humour of Captain O’Blunderbuss,
who unhesitatingly pronounced himself
and his friend Mr. Curtis to be insane, under the
impression that such an admission would prove
highly gratifying to those to whom it was made,
produced such an effect upon the young nobleman
and the baronet, that they became almost convulsed
with laughter: and it was indeed fortunate
that this scene occurred, inasmuch as its extreme
ludicrousness tended materially to raise the spirits
of Sir Gilbert Heathcote after the wrongs he had
suffered and the incarceration he had endured.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say how long the equivoque
and the consequent hilarity would have lasted,
had not the cab suddenly stopped in front of a
handsome house in Park square.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought both Captain O’Blunderbuss
and Frank Curtis at the same time, “we shall see
the bubble burst very shortly; and it will transpire
who our two mad friends really are.”</p>

<p>The summons at the front-door was speedily
answered by the appearance of Fitzgeorge in his
plain clothes and a couple of footmen in livery, all
of whom had waited up the whole night in expectation
of the probable return of their master.</p>

<p>As for Fitzgeorge, he ran up to the door of the
cab, and perceiving Sir Gilbert inside, exclaimed
with unaffected delight, “Thank God! your lordship’s
scheme has proved triumphant!”</p>

<p>At these words Captain O’Blunderbuss and Mr.
Frank Curtis uttered involuntary ejaculations of
astonishment: for they began to think that one of
their new friends was really a nobleman after all,
and that they might neither of them prove to be
lunatics in the long run.</p>

<p>Leaping from the cab, Trevelyan invited the
gallant gentleman and his companion to enter the
house, observing, with a laugh, “However insane
we may all be, we will at least exercise the common
prudence of taking a little refreshment after all the
hard work and momentous proceedings of the
night.”</p>

<p>In a few instants the Captain and Frank found
themselves conducted into an elegantly furnished
apartment, in the midst of which was a table laid
out with costly plate, and spread with a cold repast
consisting of dainties that made their months water
even to gaze upon. It was likewise a source of
great satisfaction to the two gentlemen to behold
a buffet well stored with wine and spirits, amongst
which latter the Captain had no difficulty in recognising
some poteen of the real orthodox colour.</p>

<p>The nobleman and his guests took their seats at
table, and did ample justice alike to viands and to
wine. Indeed, it was amazingly refreshing to behold
the appetite with which the Captain and Frank
Curtis addressed themselves to the former, and the
zest with which they partook of the latter. They
no longer believed that either Trevelyan or Sir
Gilbert was mad; and when the former gave them
the whole particulars of the story which he had only
half finished in the cab, they laughed heartily at the
misconceptions they had formed.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the poteen, which was duly
produced after supper,&mdash;if supper such a meal could
called, as it was now long past three o’clock in
the morning,&mdash;the Captain and Frank Curtis became
particularly talkative; when it appeared that, existing
under grievous apprehension of certain formidable
beings denominated “sheriff’s officers,” they
had hired lodgings in the classic region of Globe
Town, and that, having spent the evening and best
portion of the night at a public-house in the Hackney
Road, they were taking a short cut homeward,
past the Doctor’s house, when they became the
witnesses of the scene wherein they immediately
after bore so distinguished a part.</p>

<p>From these and other revelations, which the
Captain purposely suffered to ooze out as if quite
unintentionally, Trevelyan and Sir Gilbert gleaned
sufficient to convince them that their new friends
were “gentlemen under a cloud;” and they were
not sorry at having ascertained a fact which at once
placed them in a position to testify their gratitude
for the services of the night.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after exchanging a few words in a
low tone with Sir Gilbert, Lord William Trevelyan
wrote something upon a slip of paper, and then
addressed Captain O’Blunderbuss and Frank Curtis
in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You will pardon me, my friends, for the liberty
I am about to take and the observations I am on
the point of offering. But it has struck Sir Gilbert
Heathcote and myself, from certain words which
fell from your lips in the excitement of convivial
discourse, that you have experienced some little
disappointment respecting the arrival of remittances;
and we shall be alike honoured and rejoiced
if you will permit us to use the freedom of
friends under such circumstances. It is probable
that a few hundreds may be of some trifling service
to you at this moment; and it will prove a source
of unfeigned delight to Sir Gilbert and myself if, in
return for the generous aid you afforded us, we can
in any way relieve you from a temporary inconvenience.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Lord William handed the slip of
paper to Captain O’Blunderbuss, who, hastily glancing
at it as he folded it up preparatory to consignment
to his pocket, observed that it was a cheque
for five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>“Be Jasus! my dear frinds,” he exclaimed, addressing
himself to the young nobleman and the
baronet, “ye do things in such a handsome way
that I don’t know how to expriss my thanks at all,
at all. Curthis, ye spalpeen!” he cried, suddenly
turning round upon his companion, “why the
divvel don’t ye jine in making a spache on the occasion?&mdash;since
my lor-r-d and Sir Gilbert have lint
us five hunthred pounds to relave us from our timporary
difficulties. But I’ll unthertake to repay that
same, my frinds,” he continued, again addressing his
words directly to Trevelyan and Heathcote, “the
moment I resave my rints from Ould Ir-reland&mdash;and
bad luck to ’em! So here’s afther wishing us succiss&mdash;and
be damned to all mad-docthors, say I!”</p>

<p>Having achieved this beautiful peroration, Captain
O’Blunderbuss tossed off at a single draught
the entire contents of a large tumbler of scalding
toddy, and then rose to take his departure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p>Frank Curtis, who was in a most glorious state
of mental obfuscation&mdash;beholding two Trevelyans,
two baronets, two captains, and heaven only knows
how many wax-candles&mdash;was with some difficulty
induced to stand upon his legs; and his Irish friend
was more troubled still to make him use the aforesaid
legs when he did get upon them. However,
after some little persuasion and more threatening
on the part of the Captain, Frank Curtis suffered
himself to be led forth from the hospitable mansion.</p>

<p>As soon as Trevelyan and Sir Gilbert Heathcote
were alone, the former related to his friend the
particulars of the various interviews which had
taken place between himself and Mrs. Sefton&mdash;that
lady’s discovery of her daughter Agnes&mdash;and her
removal to the villa at Bayswater.</p>

<p>The baronet was profoundly agitated&mdash;but it
was with mingled surprise and joy&mdash;when he heard
those tidings relative to Agnes: he rose and paced
the room with uneven steps,&mdash;and then, reseating
himself, appeared anxious to make certain revelations&mdash;or
rather, unbosom his mind to his young
friend. But, feeling perhaps unequal to the task
at that moment, after the long hours of excitement
through which he had just passed, he said, abruptly,
“Trevelyan, I have matters of importance to confide
to you: but it shall be for another occasion!
I must now leave you&mdash;’tis nearly five o’clock&mdash;the
morning has dawned some time&mdash;and I am impatient
to repair to the villa at Bayswater.”</p>

<p>“Will you not take an hour’s repose before you
depart?” inquired Lord William Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“Oh! I could not close my eyes in sleep again
until I have embraced those who&mdash;&mdash;But pardon
me for this excitement&mdash;this agitation,” exclaimed
Sir Gilbert, interrupting himself suddenly. “To-morrow
I will tell you all&mdash;everything,” he added,
pressing Trevelyan’s hand warmly: “and then you
will better comprehend the feelings which move me
now. Farewell, my dear friend, for the present.”</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert was about to take his departure,
when Fitzgeorge entered the room, and addressing
himself to his master, said, “My lord, I had forgotten
to inform your lordship that when I returned
hither last evening, after leaving you at Dr.
Swinton’s, I found the Marquis of Delmour waiting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The Marquis of Delmour!” ejaculated Sir Gilbert
Heathcote.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Fitzgeorge. “The Marquis
appeared to be in a very excited state, and was most
anxious to see your lordship,” continued the valet,
again addressing himself to his master. “I assured
him that your lordship was gone out of town, and
might not return for a day or two&mdash;whereupon he
almost flew into a rage with me for giving him such
information. He paced the room in great agitation,
and asked me several questions relative to any
ladies who might visit at the mansion: but I answered
that your lordship was not accustomed to
receive visitresses at all. At length he took his departure,
stating that he should call again in the
morning at ten o’clock, and take his chance of finding
your lordship at home.”</p>

<p>“I understand full well the meaning of this visit
on the part of the Marquis,” said Sir Gilbert Heathcote
to Trevelyan, when the valet had retired; “but
I have not time for explanations now. My impatience
to repair to Bayswater is intense, unseasonable
though the hour is for arousing ladies from their
slumbers. One request I have, however, to make,
my dear Trevelyan,” added the baronet; “and this
is, that you will not, under any circumstances, communicate
to the Marquis of Delmour the address of
the villa occupied by Mrs. Sefton and Agnes.”</p>

<p>“Be well assured, my dear friend,” answered the
young nobleman, “that the secret is safe with me.”</p>

<p>The baronet wrung Trevelyan’s hand with the
cordial warmth of deep gratitude and sincere attachment,
and then took his departure.</p>

<p>Lord William lay down for a few hours, and enjoyed
a sound slumber until nine o’clock, when he
rose and dressed himself to receive the Marquis of
Delmour.</p>

<p>Punctually as the clock struck ten, a handsome
carriage drove up to the door; and the Marquis,
hastily alighting, was immediately conducted into
the drawing-room where Trevelyan awaited his
presence.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCI">CHAPTER CXCI.<br />

<span class="medium">THE OLD MARQUIS AND THE YOUNG LORD.</span></h2>

<p>“My lord, you are a man of honour, I have heard,”
began the Marquis, without any prefatory observations;
“and I feel assured that you will at once
relieve me from a most painful state of suspense.
Pardon the excitement which I display&mdash;and justify
the good opinion I have conceived of you by giving
me without delay the information I am about to
seek. In a word, where is Agnes&mdash;my daughter
Agnes&mdash;the young lady whom you have seen walking
in the garden of the secluded cottage near
Norwood?”</p>

<p>“Is that beautiful creature indeed your lordship’s
daughter?” exclaimed Trevelyan, not altogether
surprised at the announcement: for the agitation
which Sir Gilbert Heathcote had shown when the
name of the Marquis of Delmour was mentioned,
and the request which he had made to the effect
that the residence of Mrs. Sefton should be kept
secret, had already created in the mind of Lord
William a suspicion of the real truth.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;Agnes is indeed my daughter&mdash;and I am
proud of her!” cried the Marquis. “But I know
that she was inveigled away from the cottage by
one who&mdash;&mdash;by her own mother, in fine&mdash;&mdash;and I am
likewise aware that you subsequently entrusted her
to the care of a lady of your acquaintance. This
latter information I obtained from a certain Mrs.
Mortimer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The information was correct, my lord,” answered
Trevelyan. “And now I must candidly confess that
I have a very difficult part to perform: for I will not
condescend to a falsehood&mdash;and I dare not reveal
the truth. This much, however, I unhesitatingly
declare&mdash;that, by a singular coincidence, the lady to
whom I conducted your lordship’s daughter proved
to be none other than her mother.”</p>

<p>“Her mother! then she is at this moment in the
care of that woman?” ejaculated the Marquis, his
excitement increasing: “and you will not tell me
where I can find them?”</p>

<p>“That is the truth which, as I said ere now, I
dare not repeat,” responded Trevelyan, profoundly
touched by the evident grief of the old nobleman.</p>

<p>“Will you be the means of separating a father
from his child?” asked the Marquis, now sinking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
through exhaustion upon a sofa&mdash;for hitherto he
had remained standing, although Trevelyan had
twice courteously indicated the chair that had been
placed for his accommodation.</p>

<div id="i_353" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_353.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Were I to yield to your lordship’s desire,” said
the young nobleman,&mdash;“were I to give you the address
of&mdash;of&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Call <em>her</em> Mrs. Sefton, if you will,” interrupted
the Marquis, bitterly: “I know that she passes and
has long passed under that name.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lord&mdash;were I to give you the address
of that lady,” resumed Trevelyan, “I should be
adopting a course calculated to separate a mother
from her child.”</p>

<p>“But that mother is unworthy of being entrusted
with the care of her daughter!” exclaimed the
Marquis of Delmour, emphatically.</p>

<p>“My lord, I have not the slightest inclination to
enter into matters of a private nature, and regarding
your own family,” said Trevelyan, with firmness,
yet courtesy&mdash;and even with commiseration for the
sorrow of the old noble: “much less,” he added,
“should I like to be constituted a judge between
your lordship and the Marchioness of Delmour&mdash;for
such I presume Mrs. Sefton to be.”</p>

<p>“Without placing your lordship in any disagreeable
or invidious position,” said the Marquis, growing
more tranquil as his naturally powerful mind
suggested the utter inutility of giving way to excitement,
“I may yet address you not only in your
capacity of a nobleman endowed with high intelligence
and strict notions of integrity, but also as
one who&mdash;unless I be much deceived&mdash;experiences
an honourable passion for my daughter. Ah! I
perceive by your countenance that such indeed is
the sentiment you entertain for Agnes: and now,
therefore, as her father will I address you&mdash;as her
parent, her protector, and her natural guardian, I
invoke your attention.”</p>

<p>“It would be disrespectful alike to your age and
rank, and also to your position as the father of her
whom I sincerely and devotedly love, were I to refuse
to hear whatever your lordship may have to
communicate,” said Trevelyan, after a few moments
reflection.</p>

<p>“Thanks&mdash;a thousand thanks!” ejaculated the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
Marquis: “I shall yet move you in my favour!
But tell me&mdash;you are acquainted with one whom,
if you please, we will continue to call Mrs. Sefton:
has she ever communicated to you any particulars
of her earlier life?”</p>

<p>“Frankly and candidly,” replied the young nobleman,
“she has confided to me a portion of those
particulars; and I have this day learnt sufficient to
fill up the few blanks which she left in her narrative.”</p>

<p>“You know, then,” resumed his lordship, “that I
wedded her against her consent: but I knew not at
the time&mdash;as God is my judge!&mdash;that I was so completely
sealing her misery by that marriage. Sophia&mdash;that
is her Christian name&mdash;was young and beautiful
when I first saw her&mdash;Oh! so beautiful that I
became madly in love with her: and you may perhaps
be aware that love is selfish&mdash;claiming its
object at any price, and at any sacrifice. Her
father was in deep pecuniary difficulties&mdash;nay, more&mdash;he
had done things which would have dishonoured
his name and even endangered his personal safety.
I had an enormous fortune at my command&mdash;I told
him that I adored his daughter&mdash;and he promised
me her hand. On that occasion he concealed from
me the fact that the young lady’s affections were
already engaged: indeed, he assured me that love
was as yet a stranger to her bosom, but that she
had been struck by my appearance, although I was
so much her senior. The duplicity of the father
was the first fault in that long chain of unpleasant
circumstances and untoward incidents: and, relying
on all that he had thus told me, I at once advanced
a hundred thousand pounds to relieve him from
his embarrassments. Soon, however, did I begin to
perceive that my visits were rather tolerated than
encouraged by his charming daughter Sophia; and
then I learnt&mdash;but not from <em>her</em> lips&mdash;that she loved
another. I felt indignant with the father&mdash;while I
passionately coveted the daughter; and under the
influence of those feelings I pressed my suit. I was
resolved not to be made a dupe by the sire, and
sacrificed by the young lady to a rival. Had she
herself frankly and candidly revealed to me the state
of her affections&mdash;thrown herself upon my mercy&mdash;appealed
to my honour, I should have acted a generous
part, my lord&mdash;yes&mdash;I should have been generous!”</p>

<p>“But the young lady was coerced by her father,
who intimidated her at one time and ridiculed her
at another,” observed Trevelyan: “I remember full
well that she told me of her sire’s unfeeling conduct
towards her.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and to me also she made the same revelation,
when it was too late,” continued the Marquis.
“However, it was under such inauspicious circumstances
that our marriage took place; and again I
appeal to heaven to attest the truth of my words
when I declare that I treated her with all possible
tenderness, affection, and regard.”</p>

<p>“She has done your lordship that justice in narrating
those particulars to me,” remarked Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“But I could not render her happy,” resumed the
Marquis: “she was constantly weeping&mdash;and our
honeymoon resembled an interval of mourning after
a funeral, rather than a season of felicity succeeding
a bridal. Much as I exerted myself to please
her&mdash;lavish as I was with money to procure her the
means of recreation and enjoyment&mdash;profuse as I
became with the most costly gifts, not only to herself
but likewise to all her relatives and friends, I
could never win a smile from her lips. Now your
lordship will admit that this was more than an unpleasant
life to lead&mdash;it was absolutely wretched.
But your lordship may conceive the deep vexation
which I experienced when, having succeeded on one
occasion in inducing the Marchioness to appear at
a ball given by some friends, I saw her pale countenance
suddenly glow with animation and her eye
light up with joy as Gilbert Heathcote advanced to
solicit her hand for a quadrille. And she smiled,
too&mdash;yes, she smiled&mdash;and, oh! how sweetly upon
<em>him</em>, as her elegant figure moved with dignity and
grace in the mazy dance. My soul seemed as if it
were withering up within me: I am confident that
I must have eyed them with the ferocity of a lynx.
But Sophia appeared to have forgotten that I was
present&mdash;that there was such a being in the world
as I: her whole attention was devoted to my rival&mdash;her
whole thoughts were absorbed in the pleasure
of his society. She danced with him more than
once&mdash;she sate next to him at the supper-table&mdash;and
after the banquet she waltzed with him. I
have ever detested that voluptuous&mdash;that licentious&mdash;that
indecent dance: but how I loathed&mdash;oh!
how I loathed it on this occasion! I tore myself
away from the ball-room, and sought a secluded
corner in the card-room. There I endeavoured to
reason with myself upon the absurdity of my
jealous rage&mdash;of the ridicule to which any manifestation
of the feeling would expose me&mdash;and of the
contempt I should inevitably draw down upon myself
from my wife, did I allow her to perceive how
much I was annoyed at what she would doubtless
consider a trivial matter. Thus exercising a powerful
command over my emotions, I even assumed a
smiling countenance when we returned home, and
when I congratulated her upon having been in such
high spirits. But all her coldness and inanimation
had come back, and I thought within myself that
she would not appear thus if Gilbert Heathcote
were still in her society.”</p>

<p>“My lord, pardon me&mdash;but wherefore enter into
details which only arouse reminiscences so painful
to yourself?” interrupted Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“Bear with me yet a little while,” said the Marquis,
speaking in so mild and plaintive a tone that
Lord William could not find it in his heart to manifest
any impatience or any farther disinclination to
hear the old nobleman’s narrative: “bear with me,
I say&mdash;for I have a motive in entering into these
details,” he continued. “At the same time, I will
not be too prolix, although there are a thousand
little circumstances which recur to my memory,
and which might be quoted to prove how patient
and enduring I was under the cruel indifference
wherewith I was treated. But I will content
myself by observing that Sophia smiled only on
those occasions when she encountered Gilbert
Heathcote in society or in the fashionable promenades:
at other times she shrouded herself in a
species of dreamy apathy. Her father, perceiving
when it was too late how utterly he had wrecked
his daughter’s happiness, died of a broken heart:
but, strange to say, it was not long after this event
that Sophia appeared suddenly to rally a little and
seek a more active existence. She began to take frequent
airings in the carriage&mdash;grew addicted to shopping&mdash;accepted
every invitation that was sent for
balls, routs, card-parties, and concerts&mdash;and requested
me to take a box at the Opera: in fine, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
speedily plunged into the routine of fashionable
dissipation. Nevertheless, when alone with me,
she was ever cold and reserved&mdash;if not positively
sullen and morose. In the course of time she was
in the way to become a mother&mdash;and I hoped that
the birth of a child might subdue a portion of her
coldness towards me, even if the tie were not strong
enough to induce her to love me. But when Agnes&mdash;my
darling Agnes&mdash;was born, her manner varied
not one tittle in respect to myself. Time passed
on&mdash;and at last I began to entertain serious suspicions
of the fidelity of my wife&mdash;for I found that
she had frequent interviews, not altogether accidental,
with Sir Gilbert Heathcote, who about that
time succeeded to a baronetcy and a tolerable fortune.
I remonstrated with the Marchioness upon
her imprudence&mdash;to give her conduct no harsher
name; and then began a series of quarrels, disputes
and bickerings, which made my life more
wretched than ever. On one of those occasions
she reproached me for having married her&mdash;and she
declared that she never had loved, and never could
love me. Alas! I knew it but too well,&mdash;knew
also that she <em>had</em> loved, and <em>still</em> loved another!
And it was likewise after one of those disputes to
which I have alluded that a horrible suspicion first
entered my mind&mdash;a suspicion that the Marchioness
had been unfaithful to me, and that Agnes was not
my own child.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my lord&mdash;continue this painful narrative no
farther!” exclaimed Trevelyan. “It shocks me to
be thus made the depositary of secrets of so delicate
a nature!”</p>

<p>“Again do I implore your patience, Lord William,”
cried the Marquis: “and as I have advanced
thus far in my sad story, permit me to carry it on
to the conclusion. I was observing, then, that a
dreadful suspicion seized upon me&mdash;and yet I dared
not accuse my wife of incontinency. <em>She</em> divined
what was passing in the depths of my tortured soul&mdash;<em>she</em>
conjectured the nature of the apprehension
which now began to haunt me like a ghost! Oh!
how I longed to question her&mdash;to know the worst&mdash;or
to hear her proclaim the injustice of my
suspicion: but, no&mdash;I dared not touch upon the
subject&mdash;my tongue clave to the roof of my mouth
whenever I sought to frame the words that should
accuse her. And in this manner did we drag
on a wretched existence,&mdash;I experiencing all the
misery of having a young wife who could not love
me&mdash;and she feeling all the bitterness of her position
in being allied to an old husband who had grown so
jealous and so suspicious. At last the day came
when all my repugnance to utter the fatal accusation
suddenly vanished. I had been more than
ordinarily provoked&mdash;for at a <em>dejeuner</em> given at the
house of some friends, the Marchioness received
with such evident satisfaction the marked attentions
of Sir Gilbert Heathcote, that I felt myself
insulted and outraged in the presence of the entire
company. Accordingly, when we returned home
in the afternoon, a violent scene took place between
the Marchioness and myself; and it was then that,
in a paroxysm of rage, I proclaimed the suspicion
which I had for some time cherished&mdash;I accused
her of infidelity&mdash;I revealed the doubt which existed
in my mind relative to my paternal claims to the
affections of the infant Agnes. Never&mdash;never shall
I forget that memorable day! The Marchioness
heard me&mdash;gazed on me fixedly&mdash;appeared stupefied
and astounded for nearly a minute,&mdash;while her
countenance became pale as marble&mdash;her lips quivered&mdash;and
her bosom heaved convulsively. I was
terrified at her manner&mdash;she appeared at that moment
to be <em>Injured Innocence</em> personified&mdash;I could
have thrown myself at her feet and implored her
pardon! But, in a thick and hollow voice, she said,
‘<em>All is now at an end, my lord, between you and me!
We part&mdash;for ever!</em>’&mdash;A dizziness came over me&mdash;I
felt that I had done wrong&mdash;that I had gone too
far,&mdash;and I would have given worlds to be able to
recall the fatal accusation! For I was now as
firmly convinced of her innocence, as I had a few
minutes before been deeply imbued with suspicion;&mdash;and
I cursed&mdash;I anathematised the rashness
that had marked my conduct. It was a painful&mdash;a
distressing scene: for I remember that I fell upon
my knees to implore her forgiveness&mdash;to beseech
her to remain, if not for my sake, at least for that
of the child. But this appeal only excited her the
more: and when I adjured her in the name of her
infant daughter to stay, she uttered a wild cry and
fled, as if suddenly seized with insanity, from the
house.”</p>

<p>Here the Marquis paused for a few moments, and
passed his handkerchief rapidly over his eyes:&mdash;the
reminiscences of the past were still powerful enough
to move him to tears!</p>

<p>“I shall not now detain you long, my lord,” he
resumed. “Whither my wife went, I knew not;&mdash;but
in a short time I heard that she was living in
the strictest seclusion and under a feigned name.
Will you not despise me when you learn that I
employed a spy to watch her actions&mdash;to institute
inquiries concerning her pursuits and her conduct?
But I will conceal nothing from you&mdash;and I candidly
admit that such was the course which I
adopted: for, though I still believed that she was
innocent up to the time when my abrupt accusation
drove her from the house, I nevertheless naturally
conjectured that, on thus quitting me, she
had sought the protection of him whom she loved.
I was not therefore surprised to hear that Sir Gilbert
Heathcote was a frequent visitor at the abode
of Mrs. Sefton&mdash;by which name she was now
known:&mdash;but I was unable to glean any positive
evidence of criminality on her part. And did I
seek such evidence? Yes&mdash;for a raging jealousy
had taken possession of me; and I longed to punish
<em>her</em> for daring to love my rival as she did! But as
time passed on and sober reflection worked its influence
upon me, I grew ashamed of the course I
had adopted&mdash;and I now resolved to hush up to the
utmost of my power the unhappy position in which
I stood with regard to my wife. For I already felt
deeply attached to my little daughter&mdash;and I determined
that, if human precautions could prevent
such a misfortune, she should never have to blush
for a mother’s shame. I was strengthened in this
resolve by the fact that the Marchioness herself
was disposed to shroud the past in secrecy as much
as possible: else wherefore the feigned name which
she had adopted, and the seclusion in which she
dwelt? But in the course of a few months certain
events transpired which threatened to lay bare to
the public the whole of this most painful history.
I must explain myself more fully by stating that my
wife’s father had made a will leaving some landed
property to me, and which was to descend to the
child or children that might spring from my marriage
with his daughter. A distant male relative of his
now set up a claim to that property; and proceedings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
were taken in the Court of Chancery, from
which it transpired that the Marquis and Marchioness
of Delmour were living apart&mdash;by mutual
consent, as it was alleged&mdash;and that their infant
child was in the charge of the Marquis himself. I
shall not weary you with particulars nor details:
suffice it to say that the proceedings took such a
turn and were of such a nature as to lead to a decree
to this effect&mdash;that the claims of the distant
relative were rejected&mdash;that trustees were appointed
by the Court to administer the property, until Agnes
should attain the age of twenty-one&mdash;and that, as
no allegation of misconduct had been made against
the Marchioness of Delmour, she should have the
charge of her daughter!”</p>

<p>This portion of the Marquis’s narrative will explain
to the reader wherefore, when conversing
with his daughter at the cottage, as detailed in
<a href="#CHAPTER_CLXI">Chapter CLXI</a>., he said to her, “Two years more,
and I shall no longer have any secrets from you:”
because at the expiration of that period, Agnes
would attain her majority. The decree in Chancery
likewise explained the ground upon which Mrs.
Sefton&mdash;<em>alias</em> the Marchioness of Delmour&mdash;had
observed to Trevelyan, in <a href="#CHAPTER_CLXXXI">Chapter CLXXXI</a>., that
“the law was in her favour,” in respect to any
endeavour that might be made to wrest Agnes from
her care; and the same fact elucidates the meaning
of her ladyship’s remark that two years must elapse
ere she could venture to dispose of the hand of her
daughter in marriage.</p>

<p>“Thus was it,” resumed the Marquis, after a brief
pause, “that those accursed proceedings which I
did not provoke, and which, when once commenced,
I could not arrest,&mdash;thus was it that they suddenly
placed my infant daughter within the jurisdiction of
the Chancery Court, and deprived me of the right of
retaining her in my care. It is true that I might
have instituted counter-proceedings in respect to
this portion of the decree: but then I should have
been compelled to attack the reputation of my wife&mdash;prove
her to be an adultress, if such evidence
could be acquired&mdash;and cover a noble family with
shame, while a species of hereditary taint would
cling to the reputation of my Agnes. Now, my
lord, you can understand my motive in rearing her
under circumstances of such privacy&mdash;such secresy,&mdash;in
dooming her to an existence of seclusion&mdash;almost
of solitude,&mdash;and of adopting all possible
precautions to prevent her falling into the hands of
her mother. And now, also, that you are acquainted
with this most sad&mdash;this most unhappy history, I
appeal to you whether you will be the means of
permitting the innocent Agnes to remain in the
care of her unworthy parent. If you really love
her, my lord&mdash;if you propose to make her your wife
when she attains her majority&mdash;I put it to your
honour and to your good sense whether it be preferable
that she should pass the interval of two
years with her mother, who occupies so equivocal a
position&mdash;or with her father, who has ever done his
duty towards her.”</p>

<p>Trevelyan was cruelly embarrassed by this appeal,
which in reality carried so much weight with it and
involved so important a point, that he knew not
how to act. Much as he was disposed to make all
possible allowances for Mrs. Sefton&mdash;as we had
better continue to call her,&mdash;much as he pitied her
in consequence of the wretched marriage into which
she had been forced&mdash;and great as the excuse was
for her connexion with Sir Gilbert Heathcote,&mdash;he
nevertheless could not avoid being shocked at the
idea of the young creature whom he intended to
make his wife, remaining in the maternal care.</p>

<p>His good sense and propriety of feeling naturally
prompted him, therefore, to advocate the father’s
claim to the guardianship of Agnes: but on the
other hand, the solemn pledge he had given to Sir
Gilbert Heathcote, and likewise his confidence in
the good principles of Mrs. Sefton, in spite of her
equivocal position&mdash;all this forbade him to side at
once with the Marquis. Yet how was he to remain
neutral?&mdash;he who had such a deep and tender interest
in the welfare of the lovely&mdash;the innocent&mdash;the
artless Agnes!</p>

<p>While he was still hesitating what course to
adopt, and walking up and down the room in an
excited manner,&mdash;while, too, the Marquis of Delmour,
who remained seated upon the sofa, was
watching him with the most intense anxiety,&mdash;a
loud double knock and ring at the front door startled
both the noblemen.</p>

<p>“I will not receive any one at present!” exclaimed
Trevelyan; and hastily opening the drawing-room
door, he hurried out upon the landing, whence he
was about to give instructions to the hall-porter to
deny him to the visitor, whoever it might be.</p>

<p>But the front-door was already opened; and both
the Marquis and Trevelyan heard the hall-porter
observing, evidently in reply to a question that had
been put to him&mdash;“His lordship is particularly engaged,
madam, at the present moment: the Marquis
of Delmour is with his lordship in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>“The Marquis of Delmour&mdash;eh?” exclaimed a
female voice, not unknown to either of the noblemen.
“Oh! I am acquainted with the Marquis as
well as with my friend Lord William&mdash;and I will
therefore take the liberty of intruding upon them.”</p>

<p>Before the hall-porter could offer any farther objection,
the obtrusive female brushed past him and
hurried up the marble staircase&mdash;Trevelyan having
already retreated into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>In a few moments the young nobleman and the
Marquis were equally annoyed by the appearance of
Mrs. Mortimer, who, decked out in the gayest style,
thus unceremoniously forced her way into their
presence.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCII">CHAPTER CXCII.<br />

<span class="medium">MRS. MORTIMER IN LONDON AGAIN.</span></h2>

<p>“This is really most fortunate, my lords!” exclaimed
the old woman, as she entered with a
smirking countenance and a self-sufficient air. “I
wished to see you both as early as convenient this
morning&mdash;and, behold! I find you together. How
is the pretty Agnes? Has not your lordship discovered
that I told you the truth, when I referred
you to this house for information respecting her?”
she inquired, turning towards the Marquis.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” he exclaimed, hastily: “and as I
shall proceed direct hence to my bankers, to instruct
them relative to certain cheques which I recently
gave in Paris, you may present your draft in the
course of the day with the certainty of receiving
the amount. I presume that it was for this purpose
you desired to see me!”</p>

<p>“Precisely so, my lord,” responded the old woman,
scarcely able to conceal the boundless joy which she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
now experienced: for the Marquis had given her
precisely the very information which she was anxious
to obtain&mdash;namely, <em>that his banker would in
the course of the day be directed to cash the various
cheques he had recently given when in Paris!</em></p>

<p>“And what business can you possibly have to
transact with me, madam?” demanded Lord William
Trevelyan, in a tone of the most chilling
hauteur.</p>

<p>“I thought of doing your lordship a service,”
answered Mrs. Mortimer; “and yet the manner in
which I am received, is but a sorry recompense for
my good intentions.”</p>

<p>“To speak candidly, madam,” said the young
noble, “I mistrust your intentions and do not require
your services.”</p>

<p>“It is true enough that the presence of the Marquis
here has forestalled the purport of my own
visit,” observed Mrs. Mortimer, secretly enjoying
the vexation which she evidently caused Lord William
by remaining in the room. “But I may as
well prove to you that those intentions which you
affect to mistrust, were really good; and therefore
I will at once inform your lordship that I came to
relate to you all that took place between the Marquis
and me in Paris three days ago. For I thought
that I might as well prepare you for a visit on the
part of my Lord Delmour; and I was in hopes of
being the first to reveal to you the high birth of
the young lady whom you had believed to be plain
<em>Agnes Vernon</em>.”</p>

<p>“For which officiousness you would have expected
a handsome remuneration,” said Lord William, with
a contemptuous curling of the lip. “No&mdash;madam:
you will not obtain a single guinea from me! I can
read your character thoroughly&mdash;and, grieved as I
am to be compelled to address a female in so harsh
a manner, I must nevertheless beg you to relieve
me of your presence as speedily as possible.”</p>

<p>“I have no wish to intrude myself any longer
upon your lordships,” observed Mrs. Mortimer;
and, with a respectful curtsey to the Marquis and
a stiff inclination of the head to Trevelyan, she took
her departure.</p>

<p>“And now, my lord,” said the impatient Marquis,
“that we are relieved of the company of that despicable
woman&mdash;for in no other light can I regard
her&mdash;may I solicit your decision in the important
matter that yet remains to be settled?”</p>

<p>“It grieves me&mdash;believe me, my dear Marquis, it
pains me to keep you in suspense,” returned Trevelyan:
“but on one side my inclination prompts
me to act in accordance with your wishes&mdash;on the
other, my word is pledged to retain the abode of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sefton,” interrupted the old nobleman,
hastily.</p>

<p>“To retain the address of that lady a profound
secret,” added Trevelyan. “But this much I will
promise&mdash;this much I will undertake:&mdash;without
delay to repair to Mrs. Sefton and urge her to deliver
up Lady Agnes to your care. I have that
confidence in her rectitude of principle, which
induces me to hope for success when I shall have
placed the entire matter before her in its proper
light.”</p>

<p>“With this assurance I must rest contented for
the present,” observed the Marquis. “But hear the
resolution to which I have come,” he continued, rising
from his seat, and speaking in a tone of excitement.
“Hitherto I have done all I could&mdash;aye, and far
more than the generality of injured husbands would
have done&mdash;to cast a veil over the unhappy circumstances
which I have this morning related to you.
But should she refuse to deliver up my daughter
to my care&mdash;should she entrench herself behind the
decision of the Chancery Court&mdash;I shall then remain
peaceable no longer. It shall be war&mdash;open
war&mdash;between her and me. I will appeal to the
tribunals of my country&mdash;I will apply to the Ecclesiastical
Court and the House of Lords for a divorce&mdash;and
I will adopt the necessary proceedings and
furnish the proper evidence to induce the Lord
Chancellor to deprive the erring mother of the care
of her child. Such is my determination, Lord William&mdash;and
you may use the menace, which is no
idle one, to bring that woman to reason.”</p>

<p>With these words the Marquis pressed the hand
of the young nobleman, and took his leave hastily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer, who was seated in a cab at a
little distance, watching for the departure of the
Marquis, beheld him enter his carriage, which immediately
drove away; and the humbler vehicle
was thereupon directed to follow the more imposing
equipage.</p>

<p>The carriage proceeded into the Strand, and
stopped at the door of an eminent banking-house,
which the Marquis entered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer, having dogged him thither, alighted
at a little distance and dismissed the cab.</p>

<p>She watched the old nobleman come forth again;
and then she repaired to a coffee-house in the neighbourhood
where she ordered some refreshment to
be served up in a private room. She likewise demanded
writing materials; and when she was left
to herself, she drew forth the cheque for six hundred
pounds which the Marquis of Delmour had
given her.</p>

<p>“Now for the grand blow,” she thought within
herself, as she carefully examined the draft: “and
it must be struck boldly, too! But the aim is worth
all the risk:&mdash;sixty thousand pounds or transportation&mdash;those
are the alternatives! I have been possessed
of enough money in my life to know how
sweet it is&mdash;and I have seen enough of transportation
to be well aware how bitter it is! And the
former is so sweet that it is worth while chancing
all the bitters of the latter to obtain it. Besides&mdash;apart
from the delicious feeling of having a vast
fortune at my command&mdash;how delightful will it be
to over-reach the haughty Perdita&mdash;or Laura, as she
chooses to call herself!”</p>

<p>And here the old woman’s lips curled into a contemptuous
sneer.</p>

<p>“I have hitherto managed matters cleverly
enough,” she continued in her musings. “Ah!
hah! Lord William Trevelyan thought that I
called upon him either to gratify some idle curiosity
or to extort money. He little suspected my
drift! It was to see whether the Marquis had been
to him&mdash;to learn whether my information had been
found correct&mdash;to ascertain whether I might present
the draft at the bankers’. And then the old
Marquis himself!&mdash;it was lucky that I found him
there&mdash;I was saved the trouble of calling at his
mansion to worm out of him whether he had instructed
his bankers to pay the cheque,&mdash;not <em>my</em>
paltry draft for six hundred&mdash;but Perdita’s grand
amount of sixty thousand! In all this I succeeded
admirably: and now for the desperate venture.”</p>

<p>Having thus communed with herself, Mrs. Mortimer
partook of a little refreshment; for she was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
anxious to while away an hour before she went to
the bank, so as not to present herself too soon after
the visit of the Marquis of Delmour to the establishment.</p>

<p>When she had eaten and drank as drunk as much as she
cared for, she addressed herself to the grand project
which she had in view, and in furtherance of which
she had demanded the private room and the writing
materials at the coffee-house.</p>

<p>The writing of the Marquis was execrably bad;
and it was not a very difficult matter to add <em>ty</em> to
the <em>six</em>, and transform the word <em>hundred</em> into <em>thousand</em>,
in the body of the cheque; while the simple
addition of 00 to the 600<em>l.</em> written in figures in the
corner, completed the forgery.</p>

<p>The cheque, therefore, now stood for <em>sixty thousand
pounds</em>, instead of <em>six hundred</em>, payable to <em>bearer</em>,
no particular name being mentioned as the intended
recipient.</p>

<p>When the old woman had thus transformed the
document, a glow of triumph animated her hideous
countenance: but in a few moments a chill&mdash;a cold,
creeping tremor came over her&mdash;as if a clammy
snake were gradually coiling itself around her form,
underneath her clothes;&mdash;for she remembered all
the sensations which she had experienced when she
committed the forgery of Sir Henry Courtenay’s
name nineteen years previously!</p>

<p>By a desperate effort the old woman shook off the
painful feeling that thus influenced her; and, resolving
to allow herself no more leisure for reflection,
<em>lest her thoughts should make a coward of her</em>,
she rang the bell&mdash;paid the trifling amount incurred&mdash;and
took her departure from the coffee-house.</p>

<p>During her walk to the bank, which was close at
hand, she rapidly calculated in her mind all the
chances of success. The Marquis had unquestionably
been thither to give instructions relative to the
draft held by Laura as well as that which had been
given to herself; and there was not the slightest
reason to fear that her daughter had followed so
closely on her steps from Paris as to have been able
to visit the bank during the hour that had just
elapsed. As for the excellence of the forgery&mdash;or
rather of the alterations, Mrs. Mortimer entertained
no apprehension on that score; and thus, all things
considered, she deemed failure to be impossible.</p>

<p>With an apparent outward composure, but with
a palpitating heart, the old woman entered the
bank, and presented her cheque to one of the clerks.
He surveyed it narrowly&mdash;took it into the private
office, or parlour, doubtless to submit it to one of
the proprietors of the establishment or some responsible
person&mdash;and remained away upwards of two
minutes.</p>

<p>Two minutes!&mdash;but that interval was an age&mdash;a
perfect age in the imagination of the old woman!
It was an interval composed of such intense feelings
that the hair of a young person might have turned
suddenly grey,&mdash;feelings of such burning hope and
such awful suspense, of such profound terror and
fervid expectation, that while molten lead appeared
to drop upon one side of her heart, ice seemed to lay
upon the other!</p>

<p>At length the clerk came back; and Mrs. Mortimer
darted a rapid&mdash;searching&mdash;penetrating glance
at his countenance.</p>

<p>Nothing save respect and civility could she trace
thereon: and she instantly knew that she was
safe!</p>

<p>Then came such a revulsion of feeling&mdash;such a
subsiding of the terrors and such an exaltation of
the hopes which she had conceived&mdash;that it was as
if she were shooting upwards from the profundity
of a deluge of dark waters and suddenly breathed
the fresh air again and beheld the bright sun and
the smiling heavens overhead.</p>

<p>The clerk proceeded to count out bank-notes
for the sum specified in the cheque; and as he
handed the fortune&mdash;yes, literally a fortune&mdash;over
to the old woman, he considerately gave her a caution
to take care of the vile characters who frequently
lurked about the doors of banking-houses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer thanked the clerk for his well-meant
advice, and sallied forth from the establishment,
with a heart so elate that she could scarcely
believe in the success of the tremendous fraud, now
that it had passed triumphantly through the ordeal.</p>

<p>But as she was crossing the threshold, she heard
a name suddenly mentioned; and, hastily turning
her head, she found herself face to face with Jack
Rily, the Doctor!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCIII">CHAPTER CXCIII.<br />

<span class="medium">JACK RILY AND MRS. MORTIMER.</span></h2>

<p>The individual whom Mrs. Mortimer thus unexpectedly
and unpleasantly encountered, had made
a considerable improvement in his personal appearance
during the few days that had elapsed since she
saw him last.</p>

<p>The old fur cap, the greasy velveteen shooting-jacket,
the rusty waistcoat, the corduroy trowsers,
and the heavy high-lows, were exchanged for a
shining silk hat, a complete suit of black clothes,
and a pair of Wellington boots: his shirt was likewise
new and clean, and he wore a satin stock instead
of the blue cotton handkerchief tied loosely
round his neck.</p>

<p>He had evidently endeavoured to make himself
look as respectable as he could: but the almost
African hue of his complexion&mdash;the horrible hare-lip,
through the opening of which the large white
teeth glistened up to the gums&mdash;and the yellow fire
that seemed to shine in the small and restless eyes,
gave him such a peculiar aspect that it was scarcely
possible for any one who passed to avoid noticing
him.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mortimer, my beloved tiger-cat, how are
you?” he exclaimed, grasping the old woman’s
hand and shaking it violently.</p>

<p>“Very well, thank you, Mr. Rily: but pray do not
detain me now, there’s a good soul&mdash;for I have not
a moment to spare&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shan’t detain you, old beauty,” interrupted
Jack; “because I’ll just do myself the pleasure of
walking along with you. Come&mdash;take my arm&mdash;you
needn’t be ashamed to do so now: I think I’m
pretty tidily rigged&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he glanced complacently over his
own person, and then bestowed a look upon the
outward appearance of Mrs. Mortimer, who, as we
have already observed, was dressed with unusual
gaiety.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear&mdash;take my arm,” exclaimed the
Doctor.</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Rily, you must excuse me,” said the
old woman, who was most anxious to get away
from the vicinity of the bank, but by no means desirous
of remaining in the company of the Doctor:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
“I have a particular matter to attend to immediately!
If, however, you desire to see me, I shall
be most happy to meet you this evening&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This fiddlestick!” interrupted Jack Rily, impatiently.
“You know that you never kept the
appointment you made with me after that Stamford
Street affair the other day&mdash;when you went away
with the young girl in the cab; and yet you assured
me that there was money to be got through
her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, well&mdash;I have not time to talk of the matter
now,” said Mrs. Mortimer, angrily: “and I
<em>must</em> take my leave of you.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless you! I’m not going to be put off in
this fashion, old lady,” cried Jack. “It suits me to
have a little further chat with you&mdash;and I’m determined
the whim shall be gratified. So take my
arm at once, and come along. If we stand here
palavering, we shall soon have a mob about us&mdash;because
it isn’t every day that two such handsome
people as you and I are seen together,” he added,
with a horrible chuckle.</p>

<p>“But perhaps you are not going my way,” said
Mrs. Mortimer, still hesitating to take the proffered
arm, and deeply vexed at this encounter.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes I am&mdash;because I’ll go any way you
like,” responded Jack Rily, in the most accommodating
spirit.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;you shall be my companion for a short
time,” exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer, affecting to laugh
in good humour; and, taking his arm, she proceeded
with him along the Strand.</p>

<p>“I met our friend Vitriol Bob last night at a
public-house,” observed Jack, who seemed quite
proud of having the hideous old woman clinging
to him. “He looked remarkably savage when he
saw me in my bran new toggery&mdash;for he thought
to himself that the money which purchased it
ought to have belonged to him. I hadn’t seen
him since the night in Stamford Street; and, as
he had the impudence to stare at me in a threatening
manner, I went up to him and whispered
in his ear, ‘<em>What about old Torrens, Bob?</em>’ He
turned quite livid with rage, and ground his
teeth together; then, after a few moments’ consideration,
he said&mdash;also in a whisper&mdash;‘<em>If it
wasn’t that you knew that secret, I’d serve you out
nicely, old fellow: but I’ll be even with you yet, I
dare say.</em>’&mdash;‘<em>Whenever you like, Bob</em>,’ said I; and
then we sate down in different parts of the room
and stared at each other all the time we were
smoking our pipes. But not another word passed
between us; and the other people who were present,
knowing that we were excellent pals until
lately, wondered what the devil was the matter.”</p>

<p>“And did he bury the dead body, do you know?”
inquired Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“I didn’t put the question to him,” answered
Jack Rily. “Nothing more passed between us
than what I have just told you: but I have no
doubt that he laid old Torrens two or three feet
under the kitchen floor in the Haunted House.
And now, how do you suppose that I and Vitriol
Bob stand with regard to each other?”</p>

<p>“As enemies, I should suppose,” replied Mrs.
Mortimer, wondering by what means she could
possibly shake off her disagreeable companion.</p>

<p>“As mortal&mdash;implacable&mdash;unrelenting enemies,”
continued the man, lowering his voice: for his loud
talking had already attracted the notice of the
passers-by in the Strand, and he had just caught
sight of a policeman who appeared to be eyeing him
rather suspiciously. “Yes&mdash;as bitter enemies,” he
repeated. “Not that I have any resentment <em>now</em>
against Bob: because my revenge is gratified, and I
am more than even with him. But as he will take
the first opportunity to thrust a knife into my ribs,
or dash his vitriol bottle in my face, whenever he
catches me in a lonely place,&mdash;why, I must be prepared
to struggle with him to the very death. So,
my old tiger-cat,” added the Doctor, with amazing
cheerfulness, considering the gravity of the topic,
“whenever he and I do so meet, only one of us will
walk away alive. That’s as certain as that you’re
leaning on my arm, and that I’m proud of your
company.”</p>

<p>“Is Vitriol Bob, as you call him, such a desperate
fellow?” inquired Mrs. Mortimer, wishing the Doctor
at the hottest place she could think of.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve told you all about him before,” exclaimed
Jack. “And now let me give you a little
piece of advice about yourself, old gal&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“About me!” repeated Mrs. Mortimer, with a
shudder occasioned by a presentiment of what she
was going to hear.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;about you, my tiger-cat,” repeated the
Doctor. “Remember that Vitriol Bob never forgets
or forgives&mdash;and he owes you <em>one</em>. That’s all! But,
when I think of it, I shall constitute myself your
lawful protector&mdash;because I never <em>did</em> meet any
woman so precious ugly as you are; and ugliness,
when joined to ferocity, is beauty in my eyes&mdash;as I
have before told you.”</p>

<p>“Well, well&mdash;we will discuss all these points
another time,” said Mrs. Mortimer. “I must leave
you here,” she added, stopping suddenly short at
the corner of Wellington Street, leading to Waterloo
Bridge.</p>

<p>“Your way is mine,” observed Jack Rily, coolly,
as he compelled her to walk on. “But, by the bye,
what were you doing in that bank at the door of
which I met you?”</p>

<p>“I merely went in to see a clerk of my acquaintance,”
replied the old woman, cursing in her heart
the odious companion who thus pertinaciously
attached himself to her.</p>

<p>“Come, that won’t do, old gal!” exclaimed Jack,
as he paid the toll for them both at the gate of the
bridge. “I am so well acquainted with all the rigs
and moves of London life, as to be able to tell in a
moment whether a person coming out of a bank has
been to receive money, or not. If it’s a gentleman,
he feels at his breeches-pocket to see that the cash
is all safe&mdash;or he buttons his coat over his breast
which proves that the notes are in his waistcoat. If
it’s a woman, she gripes her reticule precious tight&mdash;or
smoothes down her dress just over where her
pocket is&mdash;or else settles her shawl over her bosom,
when the notes are there. This last was precisely
what you did; and therefore, my old tiger-cat, I
know that you’ve got money in the bosom of your
dress as well as if I saw you put it there.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite wrong for once in your life, Mr.
Rily,” said Mrs. Mortimer, trembling at the remarks
which had just fallen upon her ears.</p>

<p>“Then why does your arm shake so as it hangs
in mine?” demanded the Doctor, with an imperturbability
which frightened the old woman more than
if he had actually used threats: for, little as she
had seen of him, she was well enough acquainted
with his character to perceive that he was meditating
mischief.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span></p>

<p>“My arm did <em>not</em> shake,” cried Mrs. Mortimer,
mastering up all her courage and presence of mind,
“But here we are at the end of the bridge, and I
must bid you good-bye. When shall we meet
again?”</p>

<p>“We are not going to separate in a hurry, I can
tell you,” said the Doctor: “so don’t think it.
You know I love you,” he added with a horrible
grin, which opened his harelip so wide that he
seemed to be an ogre about to devour her; “and I
love much more still the bank-notes that you have
got in your bosom. Besides, it is my duty to protect
you from Vitriol Bob; and, in addition to all this, I
think we shall be able to knock up a very cozie
partnership together.”</p>

<p>“And suppose that I decline the honour you intend
me?” asked the old woman, assuming a tone
of bitter sarcasm in order to induce Rily to believe
that she was not afraid&mdash;though, in reality, her
heart was sinking within her.</p>

<p>“In the case which you have suggested, I shall
force you to do as I choose and act as I desire,”
coolly responded the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Force me, indeed!” repeated the old woman,
withdrawing her arm, and stopping short in the
Waterloo Road.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;force you,” said Jack Rily, compelling her
to take his arm again and also to walk on. “You
had better not provoke me, because I am not the
man to stick at trifles; and if you make a noise and
raise a mob, I will swear black and blue that you
are my wife&mdash;that you have bolted with my money&mdash;and
that the notes are concealed somewhere about
your person. Then, if the police should interfere,
you will have to give an account of how you became
possessed of the notes aforesaid;&mdash;and I dare say,
from the estimate I have formed of your character,
you would not like to be questioned on that point.
In a word, then&mdash;unless I am mightily deceived&mdash;you
have committed some nice little bit of roguery;
and I mean to go halves with you.”</p>

<p>This tirade was spun out to such a length and
delivered in such a measured tone of coolness, that
Mrs. Mortimer, who was perfectly astounded at
the menaces with which it opened, had leisure to
recover her self-possession: but the rapid survey
of her position which she was enabled to take
while the Doctor was finishing his harangue, was
far from consolatory. She had indeed committed
a little roguery, and would indeed be sorry to be
questioned by the police; and she knew, moreover,
that Jack Rily was quite capable of carrying all his
threats into immediate execution.</p>

<p>What, then, was she to do? There was no alternative
but to bend to circumstances&mdash;make the
best of a bad job&mdash;and trust to the chapter of accidents
so as to avail herself of any occurrence that
might turn up in her favour.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;you keep silent, old gal,” said the Doctor,
after a short pause. “Is it that you don’t
admire me sufficiently to take me as a husband, in
the fashion of leaping over the broom-stick?”</p>

<p>“It is of the utmost importance that I should
attend to certain pressing matters,” returned Mrs.
Mortimer; “and afterwards I shall be happy to fall
into all your plans and projects.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will attend to the pressing matters
together,” said the Doctor. “A husband and wife
must have no secrets from each other. But since
we have come this way, and as my abode happens
to lie in the immediate neighbourhood, I propose at
once to introduce you thereto and install you as
mistress of the place. I have got a comfortable
crib&mdash;for Torrens’s money did wonders for me as
you may well suppose.”</p>

<p>At this moment a project flashed to the mind of
the old woman. What if she were to yield, without
farther hesitation or remonstrance, to the Doctor’s
proposals, and watch her opportunity either to murder
him or escape when he was asleep? By wheedling
herself into his confidence, she would know where
he deposited the money which, she feared, must pass
from her hands into his own; and she could repossess
herself of it, if he were disposed of, or if she
were wakeful while he slept.</p>

<p>“I do not mind accompanying you to your lodgings,”
she said; “and there we can talk over the
whole business much better than in the open
street.”</p>

<p>“There! now you are getting into a better frame
of mind,” observed Jack Rily. “This way:”&mdash;and
he turned into the low streets lying on the left-hand
side of the Waterloo Road, between Upper
Stamford Street and the New Cut.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood alluded to swarms with brothels
of the most infamous description; and half-naked
women may be seen at all hours lounging
about at the doors, and endeavouring to entice into
their dens any respectable-looking men who happen
to pass that way. Robberies are of frequent occurrence
in those houses of ill fame; and the great
aim of the vile females inhabiting them, is to entrap
persons who are the worse for liquor and whose
appearance denotes a well-filled purse. Neighbourhoods
of this kind should be shunned by all decent
persons, as if a pestilence were raging there!</p>

<p>It was into Roupel-street that Jack Rily conducted
Mrs. Mortimer; and when he had introduced
her to a small but well furnished parlour,
with a bed-chamber communicating by means of
folding-doors, he produced a bottle of brandy,
saying, “Now let us drink to our happy meeting
this day!”</p>

<p>Filling two glasses with the potent liquor, he
handed one to the old woman, who swallowed the
contents greedily: for she felt that she stood in
need of a stimulant.</p>

<p>“Now, my beautiful tiger-cat,” exclaimed the
Doctor, as he drew down the blind over the window,
“I am about to subject you to a little ceremony
which may be perhaps looked upon as the
least thing uncourteous; but it must be accomplished
all the same. So don’t let us have any
bother about it.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he approached the cupboard
whence he had taken the brandy, and drawing forth
a huge clasp-knife, he touched a spring which made
the blade fly open and remain fixed as if it were a
dagger.</p>

<p>“You do not mean to hurt me?” exclaimed the
old woman, now becoming terribly alarmed&mdash;so
much so, that she sank exhausted into a chair,
while her looks were fixed appealingly on the man’s
countenance.</p>

<p>“Not unless you grow obstreperous or have any of
your nonsense,” said Jack. “I love you too well to
harm you,” he added, with a leer that made him
more hideously ugly than ever: “but I must have
my own way all the same. So just be so kind as to
place upon the table the Bank-notes which you
have got in the bosom of your gown. It is but fair
that I should have a wife who can bring me a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
dowry&mdash;and you must leave it to my generosity,”
he went on to say, with a chuckling laugh, “how
much I shall settle upon you afterwards.”</p>

<div id="i_361" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_361.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>While he was thus speaking, Mrs. Mortimer
rapidly revolved in her mind all the chances that
were for or against her at that moment. Were she
to scream and attempt resistance, could she succeed
in alarming the neighbourhood before the miscreant
would have plunged his dagger into her?&mdash;or,
indeed, would he have recourse to such an extreme
measure at all? These questions she at
once decided against herself; and, reverting to her
former project of affecting obedience, she thrust her
hand into her bosom, dexterously separated a
couple of the notes from the rest of the bundle, and
threw those two upon the table.</p>

<p>Jack Rily instantly snatched them up; and when
he perceived that they were for <em>a thousand pounds</em>
each, he could scarcely contain his joy.</p>

<p>Flinging the terrible clasp-knife on the floor, he
rushed upon the old woman, who was seized with
too sudden and too profound a terror to permit her
even to give utterance to the faintest ejaculation&mdash;for
she thought that he intended to murder her:
but her cruel apprehensions fled in another moment
when the loathsome monster, throwing his arms
about her neck, began to embrace and fondle her
as if she were a blooming beauty of seventeen instead
of a hideous harridan upwards of sixty.
Nevertheless, old and polluted as she was, and
inured to all circumstances of disgust as her term
of transportation had rendered her, she revolted
with a sickening sensation from the pawings and
caresses of the hare-lipped wretch who had thus
enfolded her in his horrible embrace. She therefore
struggled to rid herself of him&mdash;to escape from
his arms: but he, almost maddened with the joy
which the sight of the bank-notes had raised up in
his breast, hugged her only the more tightly in
proportion as her resistance became the more desperate.</p>

<p>“By heavens! I’ll kiss you again, old gal!” he
exclaimed. “I care not how ugly the world may
consider you&mdash;&mdash;Be quiet now, can’t you?&mdash;&mdash;to me
you’re a paragon of beauty&mdash;&mdash;Perdition! let go of
me, you hell-cat&mdash;&mdash;there! now you’re magnificent
in your rage&mdash;that’s the humour I like to see a woman
in&mdash;&mdash;Hey-dey! what’s that?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

<p>And, as he uttered this ejaculation, he suddenly
quitted his hold upon Mrs. Mortimer, and pounced
upon something that had rolled on the floor.</p>

<p>It was the bundle of Bank-notes, which had fallen
from the old woman’s dress during the struggle.</p>

<p>“By Jove! here’s a treasure&mdash;a fortune&mdash;a King’s
ransom!” ejaculated the Doctor, scarcely able to
believe his eyes, as he hastily turned over the notes
with his hands. “My God! it is impossible!” he
cried, his wonderment increasing to such a pitch,
that he began to think he must be insane: then, a
sudden idea striking him, he turned abruptly towards
Mrs. Mortimer, who had sunk back, exhausted
and overwhelmed with rage and grief, into
the chair. “Ah! I understand it all now,” he said,
his voice changing in a moment to the low tone of
solemn mystery: “you are a nice old girl, you are!
Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I understand it at last! These are all
queer screens<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>&mdash;and you went into the bank to
smash<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> some of them. By Jove! it’s glorious.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer, who was gasping for breath, could
make no reply: her mouth was parched&mdash;her tongue
was as dry as if she had been travelling for hours
over a desert without tasting water.</p>

<p>“And yet,” resumed Jack Rily, scrutinising the
notes more narrowly still, “these are precious good
imitations&mdash;too good to be imitations, indeed. I
know enough of Bank-notes&mdash;aye, and of forged ones
too&mdash;to see that these are the genuine flimsies.
Blood and thunder! what a glorious old wretch you
are!” he cried, again surveying her with a joy that
was entirely unfeigned and amounted almost to
admiration. “I suppose you have committed some
splendid forgery. But of course it must be something
of that kind,” he added, a sudden reminiscence
striking him: “or else you wouldn’t have
been so deucedly alarmed when I threatened just
now to kick up a row in the streets and attract the
notice of the police. So, you perceive, that I was
pretty keen in my surmises. I knew you had money
concealed in your bosom&mdash;and I was equally well
convinced you had not obtained it by means that
would bear inquiry. However, here it is&mdash;in my
possession&mdash;and it can’t be in safer hands. I’ll just
sit down quietly, and count how much there is.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the monster picked up his clasp-knife,
which he closed and consigned to his pocket;
and he next proceeded to inspect the Bank-notes.
But when he discovered the enormous sum to which
they amounted, his astonishment grew to such an
extreme as even to subdue his joy; and, shaking
his head slowly, he observed, “This is such a heavy
affair that the police will leave no stone unturned
to detect the holders of the notes. Whatever we
do, must be done at once; and in order that I
should be able to judge what course to pursue, you
must give me all the particulars of the transaction.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer was struck by the truth of this
observation: for she knew that the moment the forgery
was detected, payment of the notes would be
stopped, and advertisements announcing the usual
caution would be inserted in the newspapers.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose there is no use in disguising
the real truth,” she exclaimed, recovering her self-possession;
“and I will tell you all about it in a
few words. A certain nobleman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” demanded Rily. “Come&mdash;speak
out plainly.”</p>

<p>“The Marquis of Delmour, since you must know,”
returned the old woman.</p>

<p>“And what did he do,” asked the man, impatiently.</p>

<p>“He gave me a cheque for six hundred pounds
for a particular service that I rendered him; and
he also gave my daughter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! you have got a daughter, eh?” exclaimed
Jack Rily. “Is she anything like yourself?”</p>

<p>“She is as beautiful as an angel,” answered Mrs.
Mortimer, a scintillation of a mother’s pride flashing
at the moment in her bosom: “but as depraved
and dissolute as a demoness,” she added almost
immediately. “Well, this Marquis of Delmour
was wheedled by her out of a cheque for sixty
thousand pounds; and though my daughter kept
it quiet enough, I found out the secret. So away
I sped&mdash;back to England I came&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where did all this happen, then?” demanded
Jack.</p>

<p>“In Paris&mdash;three days ago,” replied Mrs. Mortimer.
“On my arrival in London, my course was
easy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You may almost say <em>natural</em>,” interrupted the
Doctor. “I understand the business plainly
enough at present. You altered your six hundred
pound draft into one for sixty thousand&mdash;and you
have thus forestalled your daughter?”</p>

<p>“That is precisely how the matter stands,” said
the old woman.</p>

<p>“And when is it likely that your daughter will
be in London to present <em>her</em> cheque?” asked the
Doctor.</p>

<p>“I should say that I had about twelve hours’
start of her,” was the response; “and then, as she
would not travel by night&mdash;having a handsome
young foreigner as her companion&mdash;the circumstance
of her stopping to sleep on the road would
delay her pretty nearly another twelve hours.
Besides, she believes me to be still in Paris&mdash;she
has not the least idea of my sudden return to
England; and therefore she has no particular
motive to induce her to adopt any extraordinary
speed.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” cried the Doctor, impatiently:
“but all this palaver does not answer my question.
When do you expect your daughter will reach
London?”</p>

<p>“This evening,” replied the old woman: “too
late to present her cheque at the bank. And
there <em>are</em> means&mdash;yes, there are means,” she continued
in a musing tone, “which, if skilfully
adopted, would compel my daughter to refrain
from offering her draft at all, and likewise force
her to leave us in undisturbed possession of the
money.”</p>

<p>“And those means?” demanded Jack Rily, his
eyes brightening.</p>

<p>“Before I explain myself, let us come to a thorough
understanding,” said Mrs. Mortimer. “Will
you restore me one-half of the amount you now
hold in your possession? I am content to abandon
the other half to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is a bargain,” answered Jack Rily;
“for I see that you do not relish the idea of living
with me altogether, and that you will leave me
when this matter is properly settled. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Well, such is indeed my intention,” responded
the old woman.</p>

<p>“Our relative position now stands in this manner,”
continued Jack Rily: “there are sixty thousand
pounds’ worth of good notes. With all my
connexion amongst fences and receivers of such
flimsy, I could not manage to obtain gold for more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
than two or three thousand in the course of the day;
and to-morrow morning your daughter may present
her cheque, when a discovery will take place, and
all the rest of the notes will be useless. As for
going over to the continent, and endeavouring to
pass them there, the thing would be ridiculous; for
the advertisements in the newspapers would put all
the money-changers in Europe upon their guard.
Thus far, then, the notes are not worth more than
two or three thousand pounds to me. But, on the
other hand, you say that you have the means of
stopping your daughter’s mouth, and compelling
her to put up with the loss. In this case, the whole
amount of notes becomes available; and therefore
we will share and share alike.”</p>

<p>“Then give me my moiety at once,” said the old
woman, with greedy impatience.</p>

<p>“No such thing!” ejaculated Rily: “I must
have some guarantee that you act properly in this
business; and you can have no hesitation in putting
your trust in me, because you have had a proof of my
good feeling before. I have not forgotten that you
saved my life in the struggle with Vitriol Bob; and
the same feeling that made me give you half the
spoil <em>then</em>, will prompt me to act with equal fairness
now. You are therefore at liberty to depart
when you choose, and to go where you like: the
notes will remain in my possession&mdash;and when you
come back to me with the assurance that you have
prevented your daughter from taking any step that
may lead to an explosion of the whole business, your
share shall be immediately forthcoming. I have now
put the matter in the proper light; and with such a
good understanding, there can be no quarrelling.
As to whether you afterwards choose to become my
broom-stick wife, I must leave it entirely to yourself:
for though I should be as happy as a king in
the possession of your old person and sixty thousand
pounds, yet I shall be able to console myself
for your loss by means of the thirty thousand that
will remain to me.”</p>

<p>During this long tirade, all the first portion of which
was delivered in a tone of business-like seriousness,
Mrs. Mortimer was hastily reflecting upon the improvement
that had so unexpectedly taken place in
the aspect of her affairs: for she now found herself
at liberty to leave the monster whom she loathed
and abhorred, and she had every chance of regaining
and being able to make use of the moiety of the
Bank-notes.</p>

<p>She accordingly assented to the conditions proposed
by the Doctor, leaving the broom-stick marriage
“an open question;” and having settled her
disordered attire, she took her departure&mdash;not however
before she had been compelled to submit to
another hugging on the part of the hare-lipped
wretch whose caresses were so revolting and intolerable.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCIV">CHAPTER CXCIV.<br />

<span class="medium">MOTHER AND DAUGHTER AGAIN.</span></h2>

<p>It was about five o’clock in the evening of the
same day on which these events occurred, that
Laura Mortimer and the Count of Carignano, attended
by Rosalie, arrived in London by the South
Eastern Railway; and they immediately repaired
to an hotel at the west-end of the town.</p>

<p>Although the young Italian nobleman had experienced
sufficient leisure for reflection with regard
to the step which he was about to take, the enthusiasm
of his passion had not undergone the least
abatement: on the contrary, the more he saw of
Laura, and the longer he was in her company, the
more ardently did he burn to make her his wife.</p>

<p>Nor can this infatuation on his part be a subject
of wonder or surprise with our readers: for when
it is remembered that the artful creature united the
most winning ways and captivating manners to the
most transcendent loveliness, and that the Count
of Carignano had the warm Italian blood flowing
in his veins,&mdash;when, too, it is recollected that the
syren maintained an incessant fire upon his heart
with the artillery of her charms and her fascinations&mdash;never
permitting the conversation to droop
throughout the journey, and never seeming wearied
of lavishing the tenderest caresses upon her handsome
companion,&mdash;when all these circumstances are
taken into consideration, it cannot be a matter of
wonderment if the silken chains in which Lorenzo
was ensnared, were completely rivetted.</p>

<p>There was also this fact which served to
strengthen <em>his</em> love and <em>her</em> power: namely, that
she had not invited him to return to her in Paris&mdash;she
had not sought to retain him within the sphere
of her influence on the occasion of their first amour&mdash;she
had not played the part of a mere adventuress
or husband-hunter towards him. No: she had dismissed
him with the understanding that their connexion
could not be renewed&mdash;that she could
neither become his wife nor his mistress;&mdash;and the
young man had of his own accord flown back to her,
as a suppliant for her hand! That she <em>could</em> be an
adventuress or a husband-hunter, never therefore
entered his imagination&mdash;even if for an instant he
paused to ponder with any degree of seriousness
upon her character; and so far from considering
that he was bestowing any favour upon her by
making her the sharer of his wealth and title, he
looked upon himself as the party owing the obligation&mdash;he
regarded himself as the happy individual
who had the greater reason to rejoice at the connexion.</p>

<p>On her part, Laura Mortimer was most anxious
that the marriage-knot should be tied as speedily as
possible: for she naturally longed to place beyond
all possibility of doubt or disappointment the brilliant
destiny that had suddenly developed itself to
her view. Even the possession of the cheque for
sixty thousand pounds was a secondary consideration,
in comparison with her desire to secure that
proud title of Countess which was now within her
reach.</p>

<p>Having partaken of a hasty dinner at the hotel,
Laura and her intended husband repaired without
delay to a fashionable house-agent in the neighbourhood;
and it happened that he had upon his list a
furnished villa of which possession might be taken
at an hour’s notice. It was situated in Westbourne
Place, Pimlico, and was in perfect readiness for the
reception of occupants. Thither the Count, Laura,
and the house-agent immediately proceeded; and as
the villa fully corresponded, in all its conveniences
and appointments, with the description given, an
arrangement was effected upon the spot for the
tenancy.</p>

<p>Laura and the Count returned, however, to the
hotel for that night; and early in the morning they
repaired to Doctors’ Commons, where the young
nobleman speedily obtained a special license. Thence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
attended by Rosalie, they drove to a church at no
very great distance; and by eleven o’clock the hands
of Laura Mortimer and the Count of Carignano were
united at the altar.</p>

<p>The incidents of this forenoon had, however, been
closely watched by Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>The wily old woman, upon quitting the Doctor the
day before, had reasoned thus within herself:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Laura has captivated a young Italian nobleman
<em>whom she feels she can love&mdash;whom she already loves&mdash;and
who possesses a proud title and princely revenues</em>.
Those were the very words which she used
when she communicated her matrimonial intentions
to me in Paris. I know her well enough to be fully
convinced that she will not delay a moment after
her return to London, in securing her admirer. A
special license must be the means&mdash;and, as her intended
husband is a foreigner, Laura will no doubt
accompany him, at least into the neighbourhood of
Doctors’ Commons. Even the presentation of her
cheque at the banker’s will be quite a secondary
matter, when compared with the grand object of
securing the coronet which she so much covets!”</p>

<p>It was in consequence of these reflections that
Mrs. Mortimer rose early in the morning and repaired
to the district of Doctors’ Commons, where
it is no difficult matter to become an observer without
being observed, in the maze of narrow streets
and little courts forming that neighbourhood. Nor
was she mistaken in her conjecture&mdash;neither had
she long to wait. In a short time a carriage&mdash;hired
from the hotel&mdash;made its appearance, and a handsome
young man, with a clear olive complexion and
a glossy moustache, alighted. A lady thrust out her
head to give him a few whispered instructions; and
the beauteous countenance was not so completely
shaded by the white bonnet and the veil, but that
Mrs. Mortimer, from the nook where she had concealed
herself, could recognise the features of her
daughter. In a short time the handsome Italian
returned, his own countenance glowing with delight;
and the moment he re-entered the vehicle, it drove
away. Mrs. Mortimer had a cab in attendance; and
she followed the carriage to within sight of the
church at which it stopped. She then dismissed the
cab, and boldly entered the church, in order to become
perfectly convinced that no unexpected accident
should interfere with the marriage ceremony.
Seating herself in a pew at a distance from the
altar, she could behold everything without being
observed by those whom she was thus watching.
She saw Laura converse for a few moments with
the sexton, who immediately afterwards hurried
away; and in about a quarter of an hour he returned
in company with the clergyman and the
clerk. The ceremony then took place; and when
the Count of Carignano was leading Laura back to
the carriage, Rosalie being in close attendance upon
them, Mrs. Mortimer suddenly emerged from the
pew.</p>

<p>For an instant her daughter started and seemed
profoundly vexed at this abrupt and unaccountable
appearance of her parent; but in the next moment she
recovered her self-possession, and, assuming a smiling
countenance, said, “I thought you were in Paris;
this therefore is an unexpected pleasure. Permit me,
Lorenzo,” she added, turning, towards her husband,
“to present my mother, who has thus accidentally
happened to enter, <em>for her own devotions</em>, the very
church where our marriage has taken place.”</p>

<p>As she uttered these words, Laura glanced with
imperious signification at the old woman, as much
as to enjoin her not to undeceive the Count relative
to the accidental nature of this meeting: for the
bride now understood full well that her mother
had been watching her movements&mdash;though for
what purpose she could not possibly divine.</p>

<p>“I am delighted to have the honour of an introduction
to Mrs. Mortimer,” said the Count, taking
the old woman’s hand: “and I hope that she approves
of the alliance which her daughter has just
formed?”</p>

<p>“Oh! assuredly, my lord,” answered the harridan:
“but I regret that I was not duly invited to
be present at the ceremony. However, I am not
the less contented that it should have taken place;
and as my stay in London is very short, your lordship
will perhaps excuse me if I crave a few
minutes’ private conversation with my daughter.”</p>

<p>“You may accompany us to the house which we
have taken, mother,” said Laura: “and my dear
Lorenzo will there grant us an opportunity of discoursing
alone&mdash;&mdash;on family matters&mdash;&mdash;for a short
time.”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” exclaimed the nobleman, who was
too happy to offer an objection to anything proposed
by his charming wife, and who saw nothing sinister
nor strange in the present scene, unless indeed
it were the sudden and unexpected presence of the
mother: but as she had offered no objection to the
match, he did not choose to trouble his own felicity
with any conjecture as to the cause of her abrupt
appearance on the occasion.</p>

<p>The bride, bridegroom, Mrs. Mortimer, and Rosalie
(who had acted as bridemaid) accordingly entered
the carriage, which drove away at a rapid
pace towards Pimlico.</p>

<p>During the ride the conversation was of that
general nature which settled upon no particular
topic, and which therefore needs no detail here;
and on the arrival of the party at the beautiful little
villa in Westbourne Place, Mrs. Mortimer and
Laura were speedily closetted together.</p>

<p>The moment they were thus alone, Laura’s countenance
suddenly changed; and her features assumed
an expression of something more than sternness&mdash;for
it was rage&mdash;as she said in an imperious
tone, “Why have you been watching my movements?&mdash;and
how dared you thus to intrude yourself
upon me at such a time and place?”</p>

<p>“Because it is of the utmost importance that I
should confer with you at once on a subject of deep
interest to us both,” replied Mrs. Mortimer, adopting
a voice and manner of such cool insolence as to
convince the shrewd and penetrating Laura that
some circumstance had transpired to enable the old
woman to proclaim her independence.</p>

<p>“And of what nature is that subject?” inquired
the young lady, still treating her mother with a
coolness almost amounting to disdain.</p>

<p>“In one sense, I am completely in your power:
in another sense, you are entirely in mine,” returned
Mrs. Mortimer; “and therefore mutual concessions
are necessary to enable us both to enjoy peace, and
follow our own ways unmolested.”</p>

<p>“You must explain yourself more fully yet,”
said Laura, believing the announcement that <em>she</em>
was in her mother’s power to allude to the secrets
which the old woman might reveal relative to the
dissoluteness of her former life. “If you desire me
to render you any service,” she added, after a few
moments’ pause, “you should not address me in the
shape of menaces; because you know my disposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
well enough to be fully aware that I am not likely
to yield to them, even though my own interests
should suffer by my obstinacy in that respect.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will talk differently in a few minutes,”
observed the old woman. “If we now
stand face to face as enemies, it is your own fault.”</p>

<p>“We will not re-argue all the points involved in
that accusation,” said Laura. “Remember the
scene in Suffolk Street&mdash;remember also the remarks
which passed between us the other evening in
Paris; and then cease to charge me with the misunderstandings
that may have sprung up between
us. You desired to play the despot’s part&mdash;I resisted&mdash;and
in these few words all our differences
are summed up. But I imagine that those differences
were settled, and that an arrangement was made,
whereby you were to dwell apart from me and receive
a quarterly stipend of two hundred pounds.
Have you thought better of the business?&mdash;or do
you require some other terms?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I require other terms, indeed,” exclaimed
Mrs. Mortimer: then, fixing her eyes full
upon the countenance of her daughter, she said,
“I am in possession of a secret which would ruin
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough, mother!” ejaculated Laura, her beauteous
countenance becoming scarlet with rage.
“I will hear no more&mdash;for I understand your
menace. But now listen to <em>me</em>! You fancy that
I am in your power:&mdash;you think that if you seek
my husband and reveal to him all the particulars
of my past life&mdash;my amours&mdash;my profligacy,&mdash;you
flatter yourself, I say, that his love will turn to
hatred, and that he will discard me! Now, I dare
you to do your worst&mdash;I fear you not! In the first
place, you shall not see my husband again: in the
second, you could succeed in working no change
in his sentiments towards me. I would give you
the lie to every word you uttered! He knows that
I am not a goddess of purity: but I should have
little difficulty in persuading him that you are magnifying
a comparatively venial frailty into a monstrous
dissoluteness. And now, mother, you may
leave me as speedily as you choose&mdash;and spare me
the pain of thrusting you from my doors by main
force.”</p>

<p>Sublime and grand in the majesty of her beauty
was the voluptuous&mdash;wanton&mdash;unprincipled Perdita,&mdash;(for
on this occasion we must give her the
name which so admirably represents her character),&mdash;as,
drawn up to her full height, and with heaving
bosom, flashing eyes, and expanding nostrils, she
thus addressed her mother. Having laid aside her
bonnet, shawl, and long white gloves, she seemed
like a Pythoness in her bridal garments; and her
manner was as energetic and awe-inspiring, as her
voice was emphatic and determined in its full silver
tones.</p>

<p>But the old woman lost not her composure: on
the contrary, she listened to her daughter with the
calm insolence of one possessing a last argument
the enunciation of which would crush and overwhelm.</p>

<p>“One word, Laura,” she said, in a voice that
commanded the young lady’s attention: “one word&mdash;and
then act as you choose. If I ere now adopted
a tone of menace, it was not with the intention of
wielding such paltry and poor weapons as those to
which you have alluded. I had not <em>then</em>, and have
not <em>now</em>, the slightest intention of venting my spite
in petty tittle-tattle relative to your amours: I will
not afford you the chance,” she added, with keen sarcasm,
“of using your sophistry for the purpose of
colouring your dissoluteness so as to give it the air
of a mere feminine frailty.”</p>

<p>“Cease this long preface, and come to the point
at once,” said Laura, a vague fear coming over her,
but which she concealed beneath a cold and rigid
expression of countenance: at the same time, she
saw full well that her mother was really possessed
of some secret power whereof she was determined
to make the most.</p>

<p>“My preface is done,” continued Mrs. Mortimer;
“and now for the matter to which it was to lead.
You have this day married the Count of Carignano?”</p>

<p>“You need scarcely ask that question,” said
Laura; “since you have ere now accompanied us
from the church where the ceremony was performed.”</p>

<p>“And you will henceforth style yourself <em>Countess
of Carignano?</em>” proceeded the old woman, still
adopting an interrogatory style.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” responded Laura: “I shall use the
title to which marriage has given me a right. But
to what point, may I once more ask, is all this long
discourse to come?”</p>

<p>“To <em>this</em>,” answered the old woman, approaching
her daughter and sinking her voice to a low whisper:
“to <em>this</em>,” she repeated, her countenance
becoming stern and resolute, while she abruptly
stamped her foot imperiously upon the carpet:
“to <em>this</em>, Laura&mdash;that your marriage of to-day is
no marriage at all&mdash;that you consequently have
no more right than I to the title of Countess&mdash;and
that you have drawn down upon your head the peril
of a prosecution for <em>bigamy</em>!”</p>

<p>An ice-chill came upon the heart of the young
lady as these withering words met her ears: but,
by means of an effort so powerful that it was anguish
even to exercise it,&mdash;yes, agony thus to restrain her
pent-up rage from finding a vent in a furious outburst,&mdash;she
preserved an outward calmness which
astonished her mother, who had expected to bring
her down as an abject suppliant upon her knees.</p>

<p>“You must still explain yourself farther,” said
Laura, in a cold tone.</p>

<p>“What! you affect not to understand me?” exclaimed
the old woman. “Or would you have the
insolence to deny that you are already married to
Charles Hatfield?”</p>

<p>“I do not condescend to a falsehood upon the subject&mdash;at
least with <em>you</em>,” responded Laura, contemptuously:
though internally her agitation was immense.</p>

<p>“And yet you <em>did</em> deny it in Paris,” said the old
woman. “But I was aware of the fact at the time&mdash;and
I cherished the secret, well knowing that it
would serve me some day or another. I little
thought, however, that I should so soon be compelled
to make use of it.”</p>

<p>“And for what purpose have you now proclaimed
your knowledge thereof?” demanded Laura, a gleam
of joy lighting up in her soul as she perceived that
her mother was vexed and embarrassed by the
calmness with which her menaces were received.</p>

<p>“In a word,” resumed the old woman, “we are
in the power of each other. You can transport <em>me</em>&mdash;and
I can transport <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Again must I request you to explain yourself,”
said Laura. “You are evidently fencing with something
that you wish, yet fear to communicate.”</p>

<p>“I will speak out at once,” exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer.
“The cheque which the Marquis of Delmour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
gave me for six hundred pounds, I altered in such a
way as to make it represent sixty thousand; and I
yesterday obtained the amount from the bankers.
If you present <em>your</em> cheque, I shall be ruined; and
therefore I propose a compromise.”</p>

<p>“And by way of opening the negociation, you level
menaces at my head,” said Laura, who, though at
first startled by the announcement of the tremendous
fraud perpetrated by her mother, had speedily recovered
her self-possession.</p>

<p>“What, then, is your decision?” asked the old
woman, trembling from head to foot, and no longer
able to conceal the horrible fears that had come upon
her: for she began to fancy that her daughter would
not yield even to the threats that had been used to
coerce her. “What is your decision, I repeat?”</p>

<p>“To refuse all compromise&mdash;to accept the gauntlet
which you threw down at first, and which you
would now gladly take back again&mdash;to place myself
in a condition of open hostility to you!” answered
Laura, her countenance growing stern and pale, and
her lips quivering slightly.</p>

<p>“But it will be transportation for us both,” exclaimed
Mrs. Mortimer: “I for forgery&mdash;you for
bigamy!”</p>

<p>“Permit me to give you <em>my</em> view of the case,”
said Laura. “I hold a cheque for sixty thousand
pounds, which I shall present to-morrow; and the
money must be paid to me. The bankers will be
the sufferers by the forgery&mdash;not I, nor the Marquis
of Delmour. This disposes of one part of the
question. For the rest, I have only to observe that
even if I were tried and convicted for bigamy, a
fortune of sixty thousand pounds would be no
mean consolation during, perhaps, imprisonment for
two years or transportation for seven. I am not,
however, so sure that any prosecution of the kind
will take place, be you never so vindictive: for I
question whether you will have the courage to
open your lips to accuse <em>me</em> of bigamy, seeing that
it would not only be <em>forgery</em> with which I should
charge you&mdash;but <em>murder!</em>”</p>

<p>“Murder!” repeated the old woman, half in indignation
and half in terror: “what mean you?”</p>

<p>“I mean that Mr. Torrens, your husband, <em>met
with a violent death</em>,” answered Laura,&mdash;“that you
yourself gave me this information&mdash;and that you
came over to London to be revenged upon him for
his conduct of former times! Now, mother,” she
exclaimed, her countenance suddenly becoming
radiant with triumph,&mdash;“<em>now</em> will you dare to
repeat your menaces against me?”</p>

<p>The old woman staggered back a few paces, and
sank into a chair. The tables had been completely
turned against her: she had come to conquer&mdash;and
she must depart conquered;&mdash;she had sought out
Laura in the hope of reducing her to submission&mdash;she
was herself now crushed and overwhelmed.</p>

<p>There was something shocking in the mortal
enmity which had thus sprung up between the
mother and daughter,&mdash;the former threatening
transportation&mdash;the latter pointing to the gibbet
looming in the distance!</p>

<p>“But you know&mdash;you know, in your own heart,
that I did <em>not</em> take the life of Torrens?” suddenly
ejaculated the old woman, starting from her
seat.</p>

<p>“I know nothing more than what you yourself
told me, mother,” said Laura; “and if the matter
should happen to go before the magistrate for investigation,
I shall only state <em>what I do know</em>&mdash;and
shall not assist your cause with any conjecture
relative to your innocence.”</p>

<p>“And would you send me to the scaffold?” demanded
the wretched woman, her voice becoming
plaintive and mournful: “would you place me in
such a position that I must inevitably sink beneath
a mass of circumstantial evidence, and be condemned
as a murderess?”</p>

<p>“Would you send your own child into transportation,
the horrors of which you yourself have experienced?”
asked Laura, bitterly.</p>

<p>“Oh! my God&mdash;this is a punishment for all my
crimes!” exclaimed the miserable Mrs. Mortimer, a
pang of remorse suddenly shooting through her
heart like a barbed and fiery arrow.</p>

<p>“You should have calculated all the consequences
before you came hither to menace me,” observed
Laura, still in a cold and severe tone&mdash;a tone
that was unpitying and merciless.</p>

<p>“Can nothing move you?” asked the wretched
woman, now completely subdued and cast down&mdash;overwhelmed
and spirit-broken.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” responded Laura, sternly. “You
may do your worst&mdash;I fear you not; and henceforth
I acknowledge you not as my mother!”</p>

<p>Saturated with crimes&mdash;steeped in profligacy as
the old woman’s soul was, nevertheless this sudden
renunciation of her by her own daughter went like
a death-pang to her heart. She fell back again into
the seat from which she had started a few minutes
previously&mdash;a deadly pallor came over her countenance,
rendering it hideous and ghastly as if the
finger of the Destroyer were upon her&mdash;and her
breath came in long and difficult sobs.</p>

<p>But her daughter stood gazing unmoved on this
piteous spectacle,&mdash;stood like an avenging goddess,
in her white robes, as if about to immolate her victim
upon an altar!</p>

<p>“Give me a glass of water, Laura&mdash;for the love
of God, a glass of water!” gasped the old woman
at length, as she extended her arms piteously towards
the relentless being, whose heart, so voluptuously
tender beneath the influence of love, was hard
as adamant against the appeals of her parent.</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;no, not even a drop of water, nor a
crust of bread shall you receive beneath my roof,”
was the unpitying, remorseless answer.</p>

<p>“Then my curse be upon you&mdash;my curse be upon
your dwelling, and all whom it contains!” cried the
old woman, suddenly recovering her own energy
and firmness&mdash;for the last words of her daughter
had goaded her to desperation.</p>

<p>“The curses of fiends turn to blessings,” said
Laura, in a calm and deliberate voice.</p>

<p>“But a mother’s curse is a terrible&mdash;terrible
thing!” exclaimed Mrs. Mortimer, fixing her haggard
eyes intently upon her daughter, who returned
the gaze with looks of proud disdain and haughty
defiance.</p>

<p>The old woman then rose slowly from her seat,
and as slowly walked towards the door; on reaching
which she turned round, and said, “Is there no
way of restoring peace between us?”</p>

<p>“None,” was the resolute and laconic answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer hesitated yet for a few moments;
then, as if suddenly embracing a desperate resolve,
or struck by some terrible idea of vengeance, she
abruptly quitted the room.</p>

<p>Laura listened, with suspended breath, to hear
whether there was any one in the hall for her
mother to speak to; but her apprehensions on this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
head were speedily relieved, and in a few moments
the front door closed behind the old woman.</p>

<p>The Count of Carignano, who had watched her
departure from the drawing-room window, now
hastened to join his lovely wife.</p>

<p>“The interview has been a long one&mdash;and, I fear,
not altogether pleasant, dearest,” he exclaimed, as
he clasped Laura in his arms.</p>

<p>“My mother wished to exercise over me a despotism
to which I cannot yield,” responded the bride.
“But wherefore did you conjecture that our meeting
was disagreeable?”</p>

<p>“Became your countenance is very pale, my love,”
answered the Count, in a voice full of tenderness.
“Ah! now it is growing animated&mdash;and the colour
of the rose is returning to your lovely cheeks.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured the fascinating woman, as she
wound her snowy arms about her husband’s neck,
“it is because your presence has restored me to
happiness, and banished from my mind the unpleasant
impressions excited by my mother’s behaviour.
But we shall see her no more&mdash;and naught can now
interfere with our perfect felicity.”</p>

<p>“This assurance delights me,” answered the
Count, gazing with a joyous admiration upon the
splendid creature who had that morning become
his bride.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCV">CHAPTER CXCV.<br />

<span class="medium">HORRORS.</span></h2>

<p>It will be recollected that Mrs. Mortimer was
far from being unprovided with money&mdash;her share
of the spoil obtained from Torrens still being in her
possession, with the trifling deduction of the few
pounds she had expended in travelling, clothes, and
maintenance, during the interval that had elapsed
since the occurrences in Stamford Street.</p>

<p>The bulk of the amount thus remaining to her
had been carefully sewn in her stays, so that it had
altogether escaped the notice of Jack Rily: and
thus the old woman was not destitute of resources.</p>

<p>But the sum in her possession was a mere trifle
when compared with that which she had hoped to
acquire from the forgery; and she now resolved to
leave no stone unturned&mdash;no measure unattempted,
however desperate, in order to accomplish her aim.
Besides, she longed&mdash;she craved to wreak a terrific
vengeance upon her daughter,&mdash;yes&mdash;upon her own
daughter: for the remorse and the softer feelings
which had ere now found an avenue into her breast,
when Laura renounced her, were only evanescent
and short-lived. We have moreover seen that this
temporary weakness was speedily succeeded by the
desperation produced by a terrible resolve to which
her mind came as it were all in a moment!</p>

<p>Impelled by this sinister influence, Mrs. Mortimer
lost no time in repairing to Roupel Street,
where she found Jack Rily lolling in a chair,
smoking his pipe and enjoying a quart of half-and-half.</p>

<p>“Well, my old tiger-cat, what news?” he exclaimed,
the moment Mrs. Mortimer made her
appearance. “Have you succeeded with your
beautiful daughter?”</p>

<p>“Very far from it,” was the answer. “And
now,” she added, ere the Doctor had time to give
vent to the oath which rose to his lips through the
vexation of disappointment,&mdash;“and now the matter
has come to that extreme point when nothing but a
desperate step can prevent the presentation of the
genuine cheque to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it will not be presented to-day?”
demanded Jack Rily.</p>

<p>“Yes; my daughter said that she should present
it <em>to-morrow</em>,” responded Mrs. Mortimer; “and I
have every reason to believe that she will not go
near the bank to-day. In fact, she was married
this morning to a young Italian nobleman, whom
she loves deeply, and whom she will not therefore
quit, even for an hour, on her wedding-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what do you propose?” asked Jack
Rily, fixing upon her a significant look, which
shewed that he already more than half divined what
was passing in her bosom.</p>

<p>“Are you man enough to risk all&mdash;every thing&mdash;for
the sake of that thirty thousand pounds which
will become your share if we succeed?” demanded
the old woman, returning the look with one of
equally ominous meaning.</p>

<p>“I am man enough to do any thing for such a
sum!” he answered, sinking his voice to a low whisper,
and laying down his pipe&mdash;a proof that he considered
the topic of discourse to be growing too
serious to permit any abstraction of the thoughts.</p>

<p>“Then you understand me?” said Mrs. Mortimer,
leaning forward, and surveying him with a penetration
which appeared to read the secrets of his inmost
soul.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I understand you, my tiger-cat,” replied
the man; and he drew his hand significantly across
his throat.</p>

<p>“Well, and will you do it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“But it is your own daughter,” he observed,
shuddering at the atrocity of the woman’s mind
which could calmly contemplate such a fearful
deed.</p>

<p>“She has renounced me,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you are still her mother,” persisted
Jack Rily.</p>

<p>“I discard her&mdash;for ever!” responded the horrible
old woman.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;you astounded me at first,” said the Doctor,
in a slow tone, as he reflected profoundly upon
the extreme step suggested: “but I can look at the
business with a more steady eye <em>now</em>. I always
thought that I was bad enough: but, by God! you
beat anything I ever knew in the shape of wickedness.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse&mdash;you decline?” exclaimed Mrs.
Mortimer, interrogatively, while rage convulsed her
entire frame&mdash;for she dreaded lest the money should
be lost, and Laura escape her vengeance.</p>

<p>“By Satan!” cried the Doctor; “if you have
pluck enough to propose, I am not the man to refuse
to execute the scheme. But how do I know
that when the critical moment comes, remorse won’t
seize on you, and you’ll cry off?”</p>

<p>“When I have made up my mind to anything,
I am not to be deterred by difficulty&mdash;danger&mdash;or
compunction,” answered the old woman. “I implored
the ungrateful girl to give me a glass of
water, when I was choking&mdash;and she refused.
What mercy can I have towards her?”</p>

<p>“None,” responded Jack Rily. “But you must
enter into farther explanations, old tiger-cat: because
at present I’m pretty well in the dark relative
to the precise nature of your plans, and the
way in which they are to be executed. It’s now
four o’clock in the afternoon&mdash;and we must settle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
everything without delay, if it’s to be done <em>to-night</em>.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> for to-night,” said the old woman, emphatically.
“My daughter and her husband have taken
a house in Pimlico&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How many servants?” demanded Jack Rily.</p>

<p>“I cannot exactly answer the question: but I
know that there is a French lady’s maid; and I
saw an English valet, who had been recommended
by the house-agent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind who recommended him,” interrupted
the Doctor, impatiently; “he is there&mdash;and
that’s enough for us. All I care about knowing
is how many people we may have to deal with.”</p>

<p>“But the venture must be made at any risk,”
observed Mrs. Mortimer. “It is of the highest
consequence to us to gain possession of the genuine
cheque&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And put the holder of it out of the way,” added
Jack Rily. “Oh! I understand your drift plainly
enough: but I wish to see my course clear&mdash;because
I’d better do the best I can with the notes
under existing circumstances, rather than get a
bullet through my brain or find myself laid by the
heels in Newgate some time between this and
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;certainly,” remarked Mrs. Mortimer.
“Well&mdash;upon what do you decide?”</p>

<p>“To risk the business,” answered Jack, starting
from his seat. “And now I’ll just go and take a
quiet walk down into Pimlico, for the purpose of
surveying the premises. Whereabouts is it?”</p>

<p>“Westbourne Place, No.&mdash;&mdash;,” replied Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;you can meet me again down in that
neighbourhood at about midnight,” said the Doctor.
“Where shall the place of appointment be?”</p>

<p>“In Sloane Square, if you like,” observed the old
woman.</p>

<p>“Good&mdash;precisely at midnight. And now be off&mdash;because
I am going to hide the Bank-notes so
that nobody may be able to find them during my
absence,” said the Doctor, with a meaning look.
“Of course I need hardly tell you that if you are
scheming or manœuvring to get me into a plant
down at Pimlico, you’ll never go away alive to
make a boast of it.”</p>

<p>“The idea that I should act in such a way, is ridiculous,”
returned Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;there is no harm in giving you the caution,
old tiger-cat,” remarked the Doctor, carelessly. “So
tramp off&mdash;and be punctual to our appointment.”</p>

<p>“I shall not fail,” said the horrible woman, who
thereupon took her departure.</p>

<p>How she passed the remainder of that day, we
know not. Suffice it to say that the leisure-time
which she had for reflection did not induce her to
change her mind nor swerve from her purpose: on
the contrary, as she entered Sloane Square a few
minutes before midnight, it was with a determination
to take her share in the awful tragedy which
she contemplated&mdash;namely, the murder of her own
daughter and the Count of Carignano. Bad and
depraved as she was, never in her life until this occasion
had she thought so calmly and coolly of
shedding blood: for if on the previous day she had
harboured the design of assassinating Jack Rily, in
order to regain possession of the Bank-notes, it was
not without a cold shudder, even though there was
something like aggravation to inspire the idea. But
now she had brought herself&mdash;or circumstances had
tutored her&mdash;to survey with a diabolical tranquillity
the hideous, appalling crime which she had in view;
and as she walked along, she clutched with savage
triumph a clasp-knife that she had purchased during
the evening.</p>

<p>Precisely as the clock struck twelve Jack Rily
joined her.</p>

<p>“Well, you have not altered your mind?” he
said.</p>

<p>“It is rather for me to ask you that question,”
was her response.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am resolute enough!” he observed; and
through the semi-obscurity of the night she could
see his large white teeth flashing hideously between
the opening in his lip. “I have taken a good survey
of the premises,” he continued, “and know exactly
how to proceed. Have you got any weapon,
old tiger-cat?”</p>

<p>“This,” she replied, placing the clasp-knife in his
hand.</p>

<p>He opened the blade&mdash;felt it&mdash;closed it again&mdash;and,
returning the knife to his companion, said,
“That will do. But there is one thing that troubles
me a little,” he added, after a few moments’ hesitation;
“and I’ll be hanged if I can get it off my mind.
Yet&mdash;perdition seize it!&mdash;I am no coward either.”</p>

<p>“What have you to fear, then?” demanded the
old woman, hastily.</p>

<p>“Why, to tell you the truth&mdash;&mdash;but come along
farther away from the lamps&mdash;&mdash;to tell you the
truth, as I was jogging quietly down Sloane Street
just now,” continued Rily, glancing furtively around,
“some one, coming hastily up from a narrow street
on the right-hand side, passed just in front of me.
We almost ran against each other, and I caught a
glimpse of the fellow’s countenance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who was he?” asked Mrs. Mortimer, shuddering
in anticipation of the reply.</p>

<p>“Vitriol Bob,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to say so,” exclaimed
the old woman. “But perhaps he did not notice
you&mdash;and even if he did, I suppose you are not
afraid that he will attempt any mischief?”</p>

<p>“Whether he noticed me or not, I can’t say,”
replied the Doctor; “because the encounter was
so abrupt&mdash;so sudden&mdash;that he was off again in an
instant. But if he did, I am well aware that he
is capable of anything. However, I don’t mean
to let <em>that</em> prey upon my mind, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“And yet it <em>does</em> seem to have depressed you a
little,” said Mrs. Mortimer.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I’d rather it shouldn’t have happened&mdash;that’s
all!” ejaculated the ruffian, forcing himself
to assume a gaiety which he did not altogether
feel; for, though no coward, yet the incident of
his meeting with his sworn foe in the manner described,
had troubled him.</p>

<p>Doubtless the man’s mind, contemplating a diabolical
crime, was more disposed to superstitious
terrors, and to acknowledge the influence of presentiments,
than on ordinary occasions: hence the
vague uneasiness and undefined apprehensions that
had seized upon him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer caught the dispiriting effects of
the encounter which her confederate had experienced
with one of the most desperate ruffians in
London; and such a chill fell upon her mind, that
she was about to propose the abandonment of
the scheme, when Jack Rily suddenly exclaimed,
“Well thought of! I’ve something in my pocket
that will do us good!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<div id="i_369" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_369.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>With these words he produced a flask of brandy,
which he handed to the old woman, who drank
deeply: he then applied it to his own lips, and
drained it of its contents.</p>

<p>“Now I feel all right again!” he cried, as he restored
the empty bottle to his pocket. “There’s
nothing like a drop of the bingo at a crisis of this
nature.”</p>

<p>“Nothing!” observed Mrs. Mortimer, assentingly:
for she likewise felt all her resolution&mdash;or
rather hard-heartedness&mdash;suddenly revive under
the influence of the alcohol.</p>

<p>“Now, then, let us proceed to business,” said Jack.
“I have got my own clasp-knife&mdash;a darkey<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>&mdash;and a
small jimmey,”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> he continued; “and blowed if it
shall be my fault, should we fail in the crack<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> to-night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And all that is to follow,” added Mrs. Mortimer,
to whom the brandy had imparted a ferociousness
which made her thirst as it were to drink her
own daughter’s blood.</p>

<p>The two miscreants&mdash;male and female&mdash;now proceeded
in silence; and as they entered Westbourne
Place a lovely moon broke forth from behind a cloud
hitherto dark and menacing.</p>

<p>“This is the house,” said Mrs. Mortimer, when
they came within sight of the dwelling where Laura
and the Count of Carignano were slumbering in
each other’s arms.</p>

<p>“I know it, old gal,” responded Jack Rily.
“We must turn into the lane that leads down by
the side of the premises. Come along&mdash;quick&mdash;there’s
a person approaching from behind.”</p>

<p>And, followed by the old woman, he darted into
the alley which separated the Count of Carignano’s
abode from the neighbouring row of houses.</p>

<p>At the back of the villa there was a small garden,
the boundary-wall of which was of no great
height; and the Doctor, in the survey of the
premises which he took during the evening, had
made up his mind to effect an entry in the rear of
the building.</p>

<p>“All is quiet,” he said, in a low whisper to his
companion. “I will climb on to the top of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
wall, and then help you up. We will soon make
light work of it.”</p>

<p>But scarcely were these words uttered, when a
dark shadow appeared at the end of the lane&mdash;and
in another moment Jack Rily and Mrs. Mortimer
beheld a man hastening towards them.</p>

<p>The old woman instinctively drew close up to
her powerful confederate for protection, in case
mischief should be intended; and scarcely was this
movement effected, when the cause of apprehension
was close up to the spot where she and Rily were
standing in the deep shade of the wall.</p>

<p>At that instant the moon-beams fell fully upon
the man’s countenance; and a cry of horror burst
from the lips of Mrs. Mortimer as she recognised
her terrible enemy&mdash;Vitriol Bob! Simultaneously
with that cry, an ejaculation of rage escaped from
Jack Rily, who, dashing the old woman away from
him, sprang towards the formidable foe.</p>

<p>But ere the sounds of the cry and the ejaculation
had died in the air, Vitriol Bob, nimbly eluding the
attack of the Doctor, raised above his head <em>something</em>
which his right hand grasped; and although
the blow was intended for Jack Rily, it fell with
an ominous crash full upon the countenance of
Mrs. Mortimer, who, striving to escape, but bewildered
by terror, was running across the lane, in
front of Vitriol Bob, at the instant.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;O heavens! what a shriek of agony&mdash;what
a yell of indescribable anguish broke upon the
silence of the night&mdash;rending the air with its piercing
sound, and raising echoes of even more horrifying
wildness throughout the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Vitriol Bob fled in one direction&mdash;Jack Rily in
another; and the old woman was abandoned, alike
by friend and foe, to her wretched fate!</p>

<p>But&mdash;see! the lights gleam in the windows of
the very villa which was to have been the scene of
a horrible murder: the painful yells, which still
continue to beat the air with their agonising vibrations,
have aroused the Count of Carignano&mdash;aroused
also the lovely creature in whose arms he
was sleeping. The valet and Rosalie likewise
start from their respective couches; and the young
Italian nobleman and the man-servant, having hastily
thrown on some clothing, descend into the
street.</p>

<p>The cries proceed from the lane: they rush to the
spot&mdash;and there upon the ground they behold a
female writhing like a stricken snake, evidently in
the most horrible tortures.</p>

<p>What can it mean?</p>

<p>They do not wait to ask the question; but, raising
the wretched sufferer from the ground, they
bear her into the house&mdash;her shrieks and screams
lacerating their ears all the time, and her contortions
and writhings being so powerful that they can
scarcely carry her along.</p>

<p>The neighbours have likewise been alarmed; but
none have imitated the example of the generous
young Italian, and descended from their bed-rooms
to afford assistance. They look forth from their windows&mdash;satisfy
themselves that aid <em>is</em> at hand&mdash;and,
believing the uproar to be created by some poor woman
in a fit, close the curtains and hasten back to
bed again.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Count of Carignano and his
valet have borne the writhing&mdash;yelling sufferer into
the hall; and Laura descends the stairs with a
candle in her hand. She has thrown on a dressing-gown,
and thrust her naked feet into slippers;
and her magnificent hair floats in messy modulations
and luxuriant waves over her fine shoulders
and her ample bosom.</p>

<p>But scarcely do the rays of the light fall upon the
countenance of the suffering wretch, when the Count
of Carignano starts back in horror, exclaiming,
“Merciful God! do my eyes deceive me?&mdash;is it
possible? Laura, dearest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Tis my mother!” cried the young lady, hastening
up to the spot where the old woman lay writhing
and screaming fearfully upon the mat.</p>

<p>“Ah! that voice!” said the dying Mrs. Mortimer,
suddenly desisting from the outpourings of ineffable
agony, as the musical tones of her daughter fell
upon her ears: “Laura&mdash;is it indeed you? Come
near&mdash;give me your hand&mdash;I cannot see you&mdash;&mdash;My
God! I am blind&mdash;the fiend&mdash;the wretch&mdash;&mdash;Come
near, I say&mdash;&mdash;Oh! I am dying&mdash;and this is
the beginning of hell&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mother&mdash;mother!” exclaimed Laura, whose
heart was touched by witnessing the appalling pain
that writhed the form of the old woman.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, my child&mdash;forgive me,” gasped the
dying wretch: “I came to&mdash;&mdash;But all is growing
dark in my mind as well as my eyes&mdash;&mdash;forgive me,
I say&mdash;forgive me&mdash;&mdash;Oh! God!” she suddenly
shrieked forth,&mdash;“this&mdash;<em>this</em> that I feel now must
be Death!”</p>

<p>As these words fell from the old woman’s tongue
amidst gasps of agony, convulsions seized upon her&mdash;and
she expired in the most shocking agonies.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCVI">CHAPTER CXCVI.<br />

<span class="medium">RESOLUTIONS.</span></h2>

<p>We must now return to Lord William Trevelyan,
who, in pursuance of the promise made to the Marquis
of Delmour, proceeded, the moment after that
nobleman had left him, to the villa at Bayswater,
which he reached shortly after mid-day; and he was
at once conducted into the presence of Mrs. Sefton.</p>

<p>This lady was alone in the parlour; and the
young nobleman immediately perceived that she had
been weeping&mdash;although she endeavoured to conceal
the fact beneath a smiling countenance as she rose
to welcome him.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” she said, in a voice rendered
tremulous by deep emotions; “how can I ever sufficiently
thank you for your generosity&mdash;your unparalleled
goodness, in adopting such measures to
procure the liberation of Sir Gilbert Heathcote?”</p>

<p>“You have, then, seen him?” observed Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“He has but this moment left me,” was the slow
and mournful response: and, after a short pause,
Mrs. Sefton said, as she sank back into her chair,
“Our interview was at first a most joyous one&mdash;but
at the end most melancholy.”</p>

<p>“I cannot understand you,” exclaimed Trevelyan,
seating himself near her.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it is not my intention to affect any
farther mystery, with regard to myself or my affairs,
towards you,” said Mrs. Sefton, hastily wiping away
the tears that had started to her eyes, and composing
her features with the sudden resolution of one who
has determined upon the particular course which
duty suggests. “Your conduct&mdash;the generosity of
your disposition&mdash;and the attachment which you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
experience for my beloved daughter, are all inducements
and reasons wherefore I should at once communicate
to you all my plans.”</p>

<p>She again paused for a few moments, and then
continued in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The dearest hope of my life was accomplished
on that day when my darling Agnes was restored to
me: and since we have together occupied this secluded
but delightful spot, I have had leisure to
reflect upon those duties which I owe to my daughter.
Moreover, I have well weighed all the circumstances
of her position and my own; and I cannot blind my
eyes to the fact that a great sacrifice must be made
on my part to her reputation&mdash;her welfare&mdash;her
purity of soul.”</p>

<p>“I begin to understand you now, my dear friend,”
said Lord William Trevelyan, his countenance lighting
up with the animation of joy: for he felt assured
that he had not formed a wrong estimate of Mrs.
Sefton’s character, when he attributed to her the
most amiable qualifications and excellent principles,
in spite of her connexion with Sir Gilbert Heathcote.</p>

<p>“Oh! could you suspect even for an instant that
I should permit my own selfish passion to triumph
over my affection for that dear daughter who has
been so miraculously restored to me?” exclaimed
Mrs. Sefton. “No, my lord&mdash;no, my esteemed
friend&mdash;I am not a woman of such a despicable description!
Not an hour has elapsed since, in this
very room, I said to Sir Gilbert Heathcote, ‘<em>We
must separate, my well-beloved&mdash;and perhaps for a
long, long time&mdash;if not for ever!</em>’ He understood me&mdash;he
appreciated my motives; and he scarcely sought
to reason against my resolution&mdash;But, oh! this
yielding&mdash;this assent on his part, was all the more
generous&mdash;all the more praiseworthy&mdash;all the more
noble!” cried Mrs. Sefton, in enthusiastic admiration
of the absent baronet’s character: “for I must no
longer keep the fact a secret from you, my dear
friend&mdash;although I blush to acknowledge it&mdash;&mdash;But
you will not think the worse of Agnes on account
of her mother’s crime&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid that I should be so unjust!”
ejaculated Trevelyan, in an impassioned tone of
profound sincerity.</p>

<p>“Thanks for that assurance&mdash;a thousand thanks!”
exclaimed Mrs. Sefton. “Yes&mdash;she indeed is pure
and virtuous; and I would sooner perish by my
own hand than present to her an example of demoralisation
in my own conduct. And it is this same
sentiment that animates Sir Gilbert Heathcote&mdash;that
has induced him to sacrifice all his own happiness
to her welfare&mdash;so that she may never have to
think ill of <em>her mother</em>! And now, my dear friend,
you can probably conjecture the truth which my
lips scarcely dare frame?&mdash;you can perhaps divine
wherefore Sir Gilbert Heathcote is so deeply&mdash;so
profoundly interested in the welfare of Agnes?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I comprehend it all!” cried Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“And now you must look upon me with loathing&mdash;with
abhorrence,” murmured Mrs. Sefton, burying
her countenance in her hands: “you must
despise and contemn the adulterous woman who
allowed her husband to exist in the belief that
another’s child was his own!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, my dear madam,” exclaimed the young
nobleman; “I entertain no such feelings towards
you. I am acquainted with all your history&mdash;yes,
all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All!” she repeated, in a tone of surprise: then,
suddenly recollecting herself, she said, “Oh! true&mdash;Sir
Gilbert told me that my husband was to call
upon you this morning; and his lordship has therefore
given you <em>his</em> version of our marriage-history.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my dear friend,” returned Trevelyan,
“he not only corroborated every thing you had
already made known to me, but gave me so many
additional details, all speaking in your favour&mdash;or
at least in extenuation&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am glad that the Marquis does me so much
justice,” interrupted Mrs. Sefton: “heaven knows
that I wish him all possible happiness! And that
he <em>has</em> endeavoured to obliterate all recollection of
me from his mind, I am well aware; and in the
arms of his mistresses he has sought relief from any
sense of injury or wrong that he may have experienced.
I do not mention this fact for the base
and unworthy purpose of disparaging the man
whom I know that I <em>have</em> injured: but it is in
justice to myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear lady, let us turn away from this
topic as soon as possible,” interrupted Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“Cheerfully&mdash;most cheerfully!” ejaculated Mrs.
Sefton. “We will speak of Agnes&mdash;and of the resolutions
which a sense of duty towards her has
engendered on the part of Sir Gilbert and myself.
Thus stand all our relative positions:&mdash;Should Sir
Gilbert Heathcote become a frequent visitor at this
house, the tongue of scandal would soon find food
for its morbid appetite in this neighbourhood; and
the discredit into which I should fall&mdash;the opprobrium
heaped upon me, would be reflected upon
my innocent daughter. That is one grave and
important consideration. Another is that, even if
the former did not exist, or if Sir Gilbert merely
called occasionally in the light of a friend, it would
be impossible, situated as we are, to avoid little
familiarities or marks of affection, which would
inevitably appear strange and extraordinary to
Agnes, and by degrees shock her pure mind.
Lastly, your lordship has honoured her with your
attachment&mdash;you have demanded of me her hand
in marriage when the suitable time shall arrive;&mdash;and
in the interval the guardianship of the treasure
which is to become your own, rests with me. I
must fulfil that trust in a manner that will give
you no cause to blush for the wife whom you will
have to introduce to the world. It is known in
some few quarters already&mdash;it may become generally
known eventually, that the Marquis and
Marchioness of Delmour have long ceased to dwell
together: but the actual cause of this separation
has never transpired, and need not. Thus, hitherto,
nothing has occurred to reflect dishonour upon
the name of Lady Agnes; and it behoves alike her
mother, and <em>him who is her real father</em>, to pursue
such a line of conduct as may be most suitable to
the welfare, happiness, and peace of that beloved
child.”</p>

<p>“I thank you&mdash;most cordially, most sincerely do I
thank you,” exclaimed Lord William Trevelyan,
“for all the resolutions you have adopted, and all
the assurances you have now given me! Yes&mdash;I
am indeed interested in the welfare of your charming
daughter; and the generous sacrifices which
yourself and Sir Gilbert have decided upon making,
for her benefit, prove how noble are your hearts!”</p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;now you compliment us too highly,” said
Mrs. Sefton, with a smile. “We have determined
upon performing our duty;&mdash;and if, by so doing,”
she continued, in a more serious strain, “I can convince
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
you that the equivocal position in which I
have so many years been placed, has not destroyed
the sense of rectitude and the true feelings of a
mother in my breast, I shall yet be able to receive
the assurances of your friendship without a blush,
and without experiencing a sense of shame in your
presence.”</p>

<p>“Look upon me as your intended son-in-law, my
excellent friend!” exclaimed Lord William. “My
opinion of you is as high as if I were ignorant altogether
of that equivocal position to which you allude;
and my sentiments towards Sir Gilbert Heathcote
are of the warmest description. For the sake
of that daughter whom he dares not acknowledge
as such, he renounces your society&mdash;he tears himself
away from you&mdash;he abjures the companionship of
her whom he has loved so faithfully for many, many
years! This is a self-sacrifice&mdash;a generous devotion
which cannot be too deeply appreciated. And now,
my dear friend,” continued the young nobleman,
“it is my turn to give certain explanations. In a
word, I have this morning seen your husband, as
you are already aware&mdash;and he implored me to become
instrumental in restoring his daughter to
his care. To speak candidly, I came hither for the
purpose of reasoning with you on the propriety of
yielding to that desire on his part&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! you would not separate me from my Agnes?”
exclaimed Mrs. Sefton, clasping her hands in an appealing
manner, while her countenance suddenly
became pale and expressive of the acute anguish
which the bare idea caused her to experience.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not after all you have now told me!”
cried Trevelyan, in a tone so emphatic as to be completely
re-assuring. “I have such illimitable confidence
in you that it would be an insult,&mdash;nay, more&mdash;a
flagrant wrong,&mdash;to entertain the notion under
existing circumstances. I shall call upon the Marquis
of Delmour this evening or to-morrow, and
candidly inform him that I can no longer recommend
the separation of Lady Agnes from her
mother.”</p>

<p>“I return you my sincerest thanks for this proof of
confidence which you give me,” said Mrs. Sefton.
“You had not, however, heard all the resolutions
upon which Sir Gilbert and myself have this morning
agreed; and now I have to make known to you
a step that is about to be taken, and which is rendered
necessary by the perseverance that the Marquis
of Delmour is certain to exert with a view to
regain possession of Agnes. I propose to take her
to France, where we may dwell in some peaceful
seclusion, until the two remaining years of her minority
be passed.”</p>

<p>“And during those two years,” demanded Trevelyan,
in a mournful tone, “am I to be debarred from
the pleasure of beholding her whom I love so well?”</p>

<p>“I do not attempt to establish any interdiction of
the kind,” said Mrs. Sefton, with a smile. “You
will of course be made acquainted with the place of
our abode; and your correspondence or your visits&mdash;or
both&mdash;will be received with delight.”</p>

<p>“In this case, I must not offer a single objection
to your plan,” exclaimed Trevelyan, his countenance
lighting up again.</p>

<p>“And had I recommended you neither to visit
nor correspond,” said Mrs. Sefton, in an arch tone
of semi-reproach, “should you have opposed our
departure?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no&mdash;no: do not think that I am so selfish!”
he cried. “I should have considered this to be the
day of self-devotion for all who are interested in
the welfare of your beautiful&mdash;your amiable Agnes.
But I behold her in the garden!” he exclaimed, as
he looked towards the window opening on the lawn
at the back of the villa. “Have I your permission
to join her there for a few minutes?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sefton signified her assent with a smile and
a graceful gesture; and in a few moments Trevelyan
was by the side of the beauteous Agnes in the
garden.</p>

<p>The young lady was mournful at first&mdash;because
her mother had already communicated to her their
intended departure for the continent: but when Trevelyan,
turning the discourse upon that topic, gave
her to understand that he had received permission
to visit them wheresoever they might fix their abode,
and correspond with them frequently,&mdash;when he
even ventured so far as to hint how it was more
than probable that he would follow them to the
same place, and establish his own temporary dwelling
there, so as to be able to see them every day,&mdash;then
was it that the young maiden’s countenance
brightened up, and Trevelyan gathered therefrom
the silent but eloquent assurance that he was not
indifferent to her.</p>

<p>The few minutes which he had obtained permission
to pass with Agnes grew into hours; and when,
between four and five o’clock in the evening, Mrs.
Sefton came herself to announce to the youthful
pair in the garden that dinner was already served
up, he uttered an ejaculation of surprise that it
could be so late! Agnes said nothing&mdash;but cast
down her eyes, and blushed deeply; and her mother,
who knew what love was and all its symptoms, was
now fully convinced that her daughter’s gentle
heart was well disposed towards the noble suitor
for her hand.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCVII">CHAPTER CXCVII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE MARQUIS OF DELMOUR.</span></h2>

<p>On the following morning, Lord William Trevelyan
called upon the Marquis of Delmour, whom he
found pacing his apartment in great agitation.</p>

<p>The old nobleman had two sources of annoyance
at that moment: the first was the suspense in
which he existed relative to the result of his endeavours
to regain possession of Agnes, whom he
devotedly loved;&mdash;and the other was in respect to
Laura Mortimer.</p>

<p>He had heard from his bankers on the previous
evening that the cheque for sixty thousand pounds
had been duly presented and cashed; and he therefore
concluded that the young lady had arrived in
London. But why had she not written to him?
His impatience to receive a note from her was in
proportion to the madness&mdash;the intensity, of that
passion with which her transcendent loveliness and
her syren witcheries had inspired him; and his excited
imagination conjured up a thousand reasons
for this silence. He fancied that some accident
might have occurred to her,&mdash;or that she had written,
and her letter had miscarried; in which case
she herself would be marvelling at his tardiness in
repairing to her,&mdash;or that she had changed her mind,
and repented of the promise she had made to become
the old man’s mistress. Then jealousy took
possession of his soul; and he could scarcely control
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
within reasonable bounds the emotions that
agitated in his breast.</p>

<p>The arrival of Trevelyan, however, promised to
relieve him of at least one cause of suspense and
anxiety; and, the moment the young nobleman entered
the apartment, the Marquis rushed precipitately
forward to meet him.</p>

<p>“In pursuance of my promise,” said Lord William,
when the usual compliments were interchanged,
“I called upon her ladyship&mdash;Mrs. Sefton, I mean,
yesterday&mdash;and had a long interview with her.”</p>

<p>“And the result?” demanded, the Marquis, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I regret to state that, after all I heard upon the
occasion, I cannot either recommend the withdrawal
of Lady Agnes from her mother’s charge, or interfere
any farther in this family matter,” responded
the young nobleman. “Mrs. Sefton will see Sir
Gilbert Heathcote no more, and will devote herself
to that maternal care which she is so well qualified
to bestow upon her daughter.”</p>

<p>“Then, my lord,” exclaimed the Marquis, impetuously,
“I shall at once appeal to the tribunals of
my country for that redress which I ought to have
demanded long ago.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my lord,” said Trevelyan, “for reminding
you that there is much to be considered ere
you put this threat into execution. By giving publicity
to your unhappy family-affairs, you may to
some extent act injuriously to the welfare of your
daughter.”</p>

<p>“True!” ejaculated the old nobleman, struck by
the observation. “And yet am I to remain quiet
and tranquil beneath this additional wrong which is
thus thrust upon me by her who in law is still my
wife?”</p>

<p>“For your daughter’s sake you must endure it&mdash;if
a wrong it indeed be,” answered Trevelyan
solemnly.</p>

<p>“And Agnes&mdash;has she learnt the secret of her
birth?&mdash;does she cling to her mother, in preference
to me?&mdash;does she devote not a single thought to the
father who has ever behaved with so much tenderness
towards her?” demanded the Marquis. “Reply,
my lord, to all these questions.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter still believes herself to be plain
Miss Agnes,” was the answer; “and she is not
taught to forget her father.”</p>

<p>“But what must she think of the strange circumstance,
that while she believes herself to be the
bearer of her father’s name of Vernon, her mother
is known by that of Sefton?” asked the nobleman.</p>

<p>“She has adopted the latter name, as a natural
consequence of her restoration to the maternal
parent,” was the reply; “but her pure and artless
mind cherishes not the curiosity which, in ordinary
cases, would prompt many questions relative to all
these points. She imagines, generally, that particular
causes of unhappiness have led to the separation
of her parents, and that the adoption of different
names was the necessary result. For the rest,
believe me that she will be well cared for by her
mother, and that she will never be tutored to think
of you otherwise than with respect and gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Is she happy with her mother&mdash;happier than
she was in her own cottage, under my care?” inquired
the Marquis, after a long panic, during which
he seemed to reflect deeply.</p>

<p>“She is happy, my lord,” responded Trevelyan:
“but I will not aver that she is <em>happier</em> than she
was. She thinks of you constantly&mdash;speaks of you
often&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then I will do nothing that shall interfere with
her tranquillity&mdash;nothing that shall bring into the
light of publicity those circumstances that would
give her so much pain,” interrupted the Marquis,
who, though sensual, jealous, and imperious in disposition,&mdash;though
addicted to pleasures of a profligate
description,&mdash;was nevertheless characterised
by many lofty feelings and generous sentiments, as
indeed the whole tenour of his conduct towards
Agnes had fully proven.</p>

<p>Lord William Trevelyan thanked him for the
assurances which he had just given, and shortly
afterwards took his leave, highly rejoiced at the
manner in which the interview had terminated.</p>

<p>It must be observed that the passion which the
Marquis of Delmour had formed for Laura Mortimer
and the hope which he entertained of speedily
possessing her as his mistress, had in a slight degree
diminished the intensity of his anxiety to recover
Agnes; inasmuch as his arrangements in
respect to Laura had not only served to occupy his
mind&mdash;abstract his thoughts somewhat from the
contemplation of the loss of his daughter&mdash;and
hold forth the promise of a solace to be derived
from the society of that lovely creature whose unaccountable
silence nevertheless tormented him
sadly.</p>

<p>The day passed&mdash;and still no communication
arrived. Let it be remembered it was on this
self-same day that Laura and the Count were
married; and it was during the following night
that Mrs. Mortimer met her dreadful death in the
manner already described.</p>

<p>The ensuing morning found the Marquis pale,
agitated, and racked by a thousand anxious fears,
amongst which jealousy was often uppermost as he
revolved in his mind all the possible reasons that
could account for the protracted silence of the
young lady.</p>

<p>He sate down to breakfast for form’s sake&mdash;but
ate nothing. Never did his gilded saloons appear
more desolate&mdash;more lonely;&mdash;and yet it was not to
them that he had contemplated bringing his beautiful
mistress!</p>

<p>Presently the morning papers were laid upon the
table; and mechanically casting his eyes over
one of them, he observed a short article, headed
“<span class="smcap">Diabolical Outrage and Frightful Death</span>.”</p>

<p>He commenced the perusal of the account; and
the apathy with which he began, speedily changed
into the most intense interest: for the article ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Last night, shortly after the hour of twelve, the
inhabitants of Westbourne Place and the immediate
neighbourhood were thrown into the greatest alarm
by the sudden outburst of the most dreadful screaming,
as of a female in mortal agonies. These terrific
signs of distress appeared to emanate from a
narrow lane, passing by the side of a beautiful villa
in the occupation of the Count and Countess of
Carignano, who, it appears, had been married in the
morning, and had only entered their new abode
immediately after the ceremony. His lordship,
attended by his valet, lost no time in descending to
the succour of the afflicted person, whoever it might
be; and they discovered an elderly lady in the
agonies of death. They conveyed her into the villa,
where, to the horror of the Count and his lovely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
bride, it was found that the dying woman was none
other than Mrs. Mortimer, the mother of the
Countess. Medical assistance was promptly sent
for; but before the nearest surgeon could arrive
death had terminated the sufferings of the lamented
lady. The horrible nature of those sufferings can
be readily understood, when, on surgical examination,
it transpired that an immense quantity of the
strongest vitriol had been thrown over her; and
there were proofs that the bottle containing the
burning fluid had been broken over her head.
The affair is involved in some mystery: but it is
presumed that, while repairing to her daughter’s
abode, she must have missed her way and got into
the lane, where some murderous ruffian, undeserving
of the name of a man, perpetrated the frightful
outrage. Our readers may remember that this is
not the only case of the terrible use of vitriol which
we have recently been so painfully compelled to record;
and, from all we can learn, there is a monster
in human shape, well known to the police, and
bearing the significant though horrible denomination
of <em>Vitriol Robert</em>&mdash;or more familiarly, <em>Vitriol
Bob</em>&mdash;who has for some time past infested the metropolis,
and who makes use of the burning liquid
as an adjunct to his predatory attacks on the unwary
in lone or dark neighbourhoods. The above
are all the particulars which we have been as yet
able to obtain, owing to the advanced period of the
night when the diabolical outrage was perpetrated.</p>

<p>This narrative, detailed with all the mannerism
of an export penny-a-liner, excited the jealous rage
of the Marquis of Delmour almost to madness.</p>

<p>The whole thing was as clear as daylight! The
Mrs. Mortimer who had met her death in such a
dreadful way, was evidently the old woman whom
he had seen on several occasions; and she <em>was</em>,
after all, the mother of Laura! The perfidious
Laura herself had become the wife of another;&mdash;and
the Marquis was compelled to open his eyes to
the fact that he had been most egregiously duped
by an adventuress.</p>

<p>Hastily summoning his carriage, the Marquis proceeded
direct to his bankers’; where he found that
the sixty thousand pounds had indeed been paid;
but, on farther inquiry, he ascertained that an old
woman had presented the cheque. The description
of the recipient was then given by the clerk who
cashed the draft; and the Marquis became convinced
that she was none other than Mrs. Mortimer.
The bankers perceiving that he was anxious to
learn who had actually obtained the money, produced
the cheque itself, the female’s name being
written on the back in token of acquittal; and
there were the words&mdash;<span class="smcap">Martha Mortimer</span>.</p>

<p>In a mechanical way, and while deliberating what
step next to take, the enraged nobleman cast his
eyes over the draft; when he started convulsively&mdash;for
he instantly detected the forgery, or rather
alteration, that had been effected: and then, in
his furious excitement, the principal facts of the
story came out&mdash;showing how he had been induced
to give the cheque.</p>

<p>All was now amazement and alarm in the bank-parlour;
and one of the partners in the firm suggested
the propriety of repairing immediately to the
dwelling of the Count of Carignano, for the purpose
of communicating with the Countess relative
to the transaction. But the Marquis, who by this
time had grown somewhat more cool, began to
reflect that any publicity which was given to the
matter would only cover him with ridicule; and as
the money was not of such consequence to him as
the avoidance of the shame attendant on the business,
he wisely resolved to hush up the whole affair.</p>

<p>The bankers were by no means averse to this
amicable mode of adjustment, inasmuch as it relieved
them from all doubt or uncertainty, and all
possibility of dispute relative to the party on whom
the loss consequent on the forgery was to fall; and
they therefore readily consented to retain the transaction
profoundly secret. At the same time, they
understood fully that they were not to pay the
genuine cheque for sixty thousand pounds, in case
of its presentation; the Marquis resolving to take
time to consider what course he should pursue with
regard to that portion of the business.</p>

<p>The old nobleman drove home again; and, on his
arrival at his stately mansion, he shut himself up
in his own chamber to reflect upon the startling
revelations of that day.</p>

<p>Not for an instant did he entertain the idea of
seeking an interview with Laura. Such a step was
useless: for she had no doubt married, he reasoned,
according to her taste. Moreover, his pride revolted
at the bare idea of undergoing the humiliation and
shame of being laughed at by one who would probably
care nothing for any reproaches that might
be levelled against her.</p>

<p>But how was he to recover the cheque? It was
valid in her hands: for even if she had connived at
her mother’s forgery, the collusion could not be
brought home to her. Still, the Marquis did not
at all admire the idea of paying another sixty thousand&mdash;especially
for one who had so grossly deluded
him.</p>

<p>By degrees the old nobleman’s thoughts became
so bewildering that he felt as if he were going mad.
He had lost his daughter&mdash;he had lost his mistress&mdash;he
had been duped out of his money&mdash;and, vile
though Laura evidently was, he nevertheless still
adored her image with a devouring passion.</p>

<p>He walked up and down his room in a state of
excitement that was increasing cruelly, and that
produced a hurry in the brain&mdash;a confusion in
the ideas&mdash;a delirium in the imagination.</p>

<p>The fever of his reflections augmented to such a
height that he began to conjure up a variety of evils
and annoyances which did not really exist. He
pictured to himself his bankers laughing heartily at
his folly&mdash;retelling the scandal as an excellent joke&mdash;and
propagating the most offensive rumours all
over the town. He fancied that he beheld his
friends and acquaintances endeavouring to conceal
their satirical smiles as they accosted him&mdash;he beheld
the entire House of Lords forgetting their
dignity and whispering together in a significant
manner as he entered the assembly. Then his
thoughts suddenly travelled to Agnes; and all his
ancient doubts and fears relative to his paternity in
respect to her, returned with overpowering violence;
until he felt convinced that she was indeed
the offspring of an adulterous connexion between
his wife and Sir Gilbert Heathcote. Lastly, by a
rapid transition, his imagination wandered to the
abode of the Count and Countessa of Carignano;
and he pictured the lovely&mdash;seducing&mdash;voluptuous
Laura in the arms of a rival!</p>

<p>All these reflections maddened the old man&mdash;deprived
him of his reason&mdash;rendered him desperate&mdash;and
made life appear to him a burthen of anguish
and an intolerable misfortune.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p>He did not remember his boundless wealth&mdash;his
proud titles&mdash;his stately mansions&mdash;and all the
means of pleasure, enjoyment, and solace that were
within his reach: his morbid condition of mind
obtained such a potent sway over him, that he only
saw in himself a lone&mdash;desolate&mdash;wretched old man,&mdash;deprived
of his daughter&mdash;deprived of his mistress&mdash;deprived
of his money&mdash;and with the myriad
fingers of scorn pointing towards him.</p>

<p>Though the sun was shining joyously, and its
golden beams penetrated into the chamber through
the opening in the rich drapery,&mdash;yet all seemed
dark&mdash;dreary&mdash;and cheerless to the miserable Marquis
of Delmour: his powerful intellect&mdash;his vigorous
understanding&mdash;his moral courage, were all
subdued&mdash;crushed&mdash;overwhelmed beneath a weight
of trifling realities and tremendous fancies.</p>

<p>In this state of mind the miserable man suddenly
rushed to his toilette-case&mdash;seized his razor&mdash;and
inflicted a ghastly wound upon his throat.</p>

<p>At the same instant that he fell&mdash;the blood pouring
forth like a torrent&mdash;a valet entered the room,
bearing a letter upon a silver tray.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCVIII">CHAPTER CXCVIII.<br />

<span class="medium">CASTELCICALA.</span></h2>

<p>Turn we now to the State of Castelcicala&mdash;that
lovely land which lies between the northern frontiers
of the Neapolitan dominions and the southern
confines of the Papal territory.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning&mdash;and bright and varied
were the hues which the sea took from the rosy
clouds, as a splendid war-steamer advanced rapidly
over the bosom of the waters.</p>

<p>The Royal Standard of Castelcicala floated from
the main-mast; and upon the deck was a group of
officers in magnificent uniforms, gathered around a
young man of tall form and noble air, who was
attired in deep black. But upon his breast a star
denoted his sovereign rank; and his commanding,
though unaffected demeanour well became the
chieftain of a mighty State.</p>

<p>That gallant steamer was the <em>Torione</em>, the pride
of the Royal Navy of Castelcicala&mdash;that young man
was Richard Markham, now become the Grand
Duke of the principality which he had rescued
from slavery&mdash;and amongst the aides-de-camp in
attendance was his enthusiastic admirer, the erring
but deeply repentant Charles Hatfield.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten o’clock on this glorious morning
the steamer came within sight of Montoni, the
capital of Castelcicala; and as soon as the Royal
Standard was descried by those in that city who
were earnestly watching the arrival of their new
monarch, the artillery of the batteries and the
cannon of the ships in the harbour thundered forth
a salute in honour of the illustrious prince.</p>

<p>In an hour and a half the steamer swept gallantly
into the fine port of Montoni; the yards of all the
vessels were manned; and the welkin rang with
enthusiastic shouts of welcome.</p>

<p>Richard&mdash;or, as we should rather call him, Ricardo&mdash;was
deeply affected by these demonstrations,
which he acknowledged with many graceful bows;
and when he landed amongst the greatest concourse
of multitudes ever assembled on the quays of Montoni,
and amidst the most joyous cries and the
thunder of the artillery, he retained his hat in his
hand as a proof of respect to that Sovereign People
from whom his power emanated.</p>

<p>The royal carriages were in attendance; and as
he rode along the streets towards the palace, the
vast crowds kept pace with the vehicles, cheering
and waving their hats and handkerchiefs all the
way. The windows and balconies were filled with
gentlemen and elegantly-dressed ladies; and flowers
were thrown forth by fair hands in token of the
general delight which attended upon the arrival of
the warrior-prince.</p>

<p>As on the day after the memorable battle of Montoni,
which gave peace and freedom to Castelcicala,
the bells were ringing in every tower, and the
cannon were still vomiting forth their thunder, their
fire, and their smoke, when the Grand Duke
Ricardo alighted at the entrance of the palace.
There&mdash;upon the marble steps&mdash;stood the joy of his
heart, the charming and well-beloved Isabella, with
their two children, the little Prince Alberto and the
Princess Eliza&mdash;so called after a valued friend.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
In company with Isabella were her mother (now
Dowager Grand Duchess), Ricardo’s sister the Princess
Katherine, and her husband Prince Mario. All
were dressed in deep mourning: but the presence
of Ricardo evoked smiles as well as tears,&mdash;and
those who wept for the loss of the late lamented
Grand Duke, found consolation and experienced a
source of ineffable joy in the possession of him who
had become his successor.</p>

<p>Moreover, the funeral of the departed one had
already taken place; and there was consequently
no sad ceremony to be performed which might revive
the bitterness of grief.</p>

<p>That evening Montoni was brilliantly illuminated;
and the streets were thronged with multitudes who
made a general holiday on the occasion of the arrival
of that excellent prince to whom they owed so
much.</p>

<p>And it was a glorious spectacle to behold the appearance
of the people in that capital of the most
prosperous country in the whole world. Not a
mendicant was to be seen: the loathsome rags and
hideous emblems of poverty which meet the eye in
every thoroughfare and in every corner of London,
had ceased to exist in Montoni. The industrious
classes were all cheerful in looks and neat in attire;
and instead of the emaciated women, and pale, sickly
children observable in such appalling numbers in
the British metropolis, the wives of the working-men
were all comely and contented, and their offspring
ruddy with the hues of vigorous health. Oh!
it was a blessed&mdash;blessed thing to behold those gay
and happy multitudes&mdash;rendered thus gay and thus
happy by means of good institutions, honest Ministers,
and a Parliament chosen by the entire male
adult population!</p>

<p>Though the streets were thus thronged to excess,
and the houses of entertainment were crowded, the
utmost order, sobriety, and tranquillity prevailed.
There were no police visible: because none were required.
Every citizen, whether employer or employed&mdash;whether
capitalist or mechanic&mdash;whether
gentleman or artizan&mdash;whether landowner or labourer,
was himself a policeman, as it were, in his
own good conduct and excellent example. <em>For
from the time that liberal and enlightened institutions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
involving the true spirit of Republicanism, were applied
to Castelcicala, the regular police-force had been
abolished and no necessity arose for its revival.</em></p>

<p>Such was the aspect of the capital of Castelcicala&mdash;that
model State where Liberty, Fraternity, and
Equality were acknowledged principles, practically
known and duly appreciated.</p>

<p>On the ensuing morning the Grand Duke Ricardo
proceeded to the Chamber of Deputies, where the
Senators were also assembled on the occasion. The
galleries were crowded with ladies and gentlemen;
and the whole of the diplomatic corps were in the
seats allotted to them. Even though all present
were in deep mourning for the late sovereign, the
aspect of the spacious hall was far from gloomy,
though solemn and imposing.</p>

<p>The arrival of the new Grand Duke was expected
with the most intense interest. It was well known
that not only had he suggested the principal reforms
which Duke Alberto had applied to Castelcicala,
but that he was even far more liberal in his
political opinions than his departed father-in-law.
It was consequently anticipated that on the present
occasion he would enunciate the line of policy
which it was his intention to adopt; and every one
felt convinced that this would prove a day memorable
in the history of Castelcicala.</p>

<p>We should observe that on the platform of the
Chamber, instead of the throne being placed for the
reception of the Grand Duke, a simple arm-chair
was raised about three feet higher than that occupied
by the President of the Deputies; and instead
of the royal standard flowing with its graceful
drapery over-head, the tricolour was suspended
to the wall. These changes, it was well known,
had been effected by order of the Grand Duke himself;
and all present were aware that his Sovereign
Highness was not the man merely to displace the
symbols of royalty without having some congenial
and practical object in view.</p>

<p>At half-past ten o’clock the Ministers entered
and took their seats amidst loud applause from the
galleries; for this was the same Cabinet that
Ricardo had nominated five years previously,
during his brief Regency; and its policy had been
such as to gain for it the enthusiastic affection of
the nation and the admiration of the whole civilised
world.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of those high functionaries,
the Royal Family appeared in the Chamber,
amidst deafening cheers, and took their seats upon
the platform, behind the President’s desk; and in a
few minutes the roar of the artillery on the ramparts
announced to the capital that the Grand Duke
had quitted the palace on his way to the legislative
assembly.</p>

<p>It was precisely at eleven that Ricardo, attended
by his staff, entered the hall; and his presence
was the signal for a more hearty renewal of the
cheering, while the ladies in the galleries waved
their snowy handkerchiefs in unfeigned welcome.</p>

<p>But it was almost immediately noticed that the
Grand Duke appeared&mdash;not in the royal robes worn
on such occasions by all his predecessors&mdash;but in
the uniform of a Field-Marshal, with a black crape
round his left arm in token of mourning for the
late monarch. He was decorated only with the
Castelcicalan Order of Knighthood, and did not even
wear upon his breast the star that denoted his
sovereign rank. These circumstances gave a sharper
edge to the keenness of curiosity; and when the
cheering, which was loud and long, died away
beneath the lofty roof of the spacious hall, the
silence that ensued was deep and solemn as that of
the tomb.</p>

<p>Then the Grand Duke, rising from the arm-chair
which he had for a few moments occupied,
addressed the assembly in the following manner:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lords and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;You have recently
experienced a great and grievous loss in the
death of a wise, enlightened, and virtuous Sovereign,
whose brief but glorious reign was devoted to
those measures best calculated to ensure the happiness,
prosperity, and morality of the Castelcicalan
people. The name of Alberto will live in history
so long as the world shall endure; and his memory
will be cherished in the hearts of this and all succeeding
generations of the inhabitants of that clime
which his wisdom and his example have so supremely
blessed.</p>

<p>“Had I consulted my own private feelings, I
should have allowed some time to elapse ere I
appeared before you to shadow forth that line of
policy which it is my duty to recommend to your
deliberations: I should have craved leisure to weep
over the loss of my illustrious father-in-law, and
meditate upon those grand lessons which his memorable
reign have taught us. But I feel that the
welfare of an entire people is too solemnly important
and too sacred a thing to be for even a moment lost
sight of; and that when the head of a State is called
away to the tomb, his successor must devote no
time to a grief which cannot recall the departed,
but must at once take up without intermission the
grand work of reform that was progressing at the
period of Death’s arrival. For it is a great and
flagrant wrong for those who are entrusted with
power, to interpose delays in the proper exercise
thereof; and that man is a traitor to his country
and deserves execration who dares to intimate that
there is no need of haste in accomplishing a great
national good.</p>

<p>“These are the motives which have induced me
to appear thus before you even at so early a period
that the remains of my lamented predecessor can
scarcely be said to have grown cold in the tomb:
but I repeat that if men accept the responsibilities
of power and office, they must permit no considerations
to retard them in the performance of their
duty and the fulfilment of their high vicarious mission.</p>

<p>“Last evening I assembled the Ministers around
me, and submitted to them the views which I had
some time ago matured, and which I proposed to
put into practice so soon as the natural course of
events and the will of the Sovereign People should
place me at the head of affairs. The Ministers were
unanimous in adopting those views, and cheerfully
undertook to lay them in the usual manner before
the Legislative Assemblies. But in the meantime,
it behoves me briefly to detail the nature of these
plans which are thus deemed suitable to the interests
and in accordance with the just rights of the
Castelcicalans.</p>

<p>“In the first place I propose that the form of
Government shall be Republican, not merely in institutions,
but likewise in name; and in order that
this idea may be fully carried out, it will be necessary
that certain sacrifices should be made in particular
quarters. I now especially allude to the
class denominated the <em>nobility</em>. The existence of
aristocratic titles is totally incompatible with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
purity and simplicity of Republicanism; and the
country therefore expects from the patriotism of
the nobles a ready concession of these invidious
distinctions,&mdash;distinctions which are nothing more
nor less than the relics of feudal barbarism. For
my part, I cheerfully undertake to set the example,
if example be indeed required to induce men to the
performance of their duty. With this determination
I have come before you to-day,&mdash;not as the
Grand Duke of Castelcicala&mdash;not as a Sovereign-Prince,&mdash;but
as the First Magistrate of the State,
retaining only that military rank which I have
won upon the fields of victory. From this moment,
then, you may know me, and I wish to be known
only, as General Markham; and this same abnegation
of title I proclaim on the part of my beloved
wife, my revered mother-in-law, and the rest of the
Royal Family.”</p>

<div id="i_377" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_377.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>During several parts of his speech, Ricardo had
been frequently interrupted by outbursts of enthusiastic
cheering: but when he reached this solemn
and important climax, the whole assembly rose and
greeted him with the most joyous shouts&mdash;the most
fervent applause that ever expressed the unfeigned
admiration of a generous patriotism. The ladies in
the galleries absolutely wept in the excitement of
their feelings: for never&mdash;never was seen so sublime
a spectacle as this of a mighty Prince casting his
crown, his sceptre, and his titles at the feet of the
Goddess of Liberty!</p>

<p>“I accept with ineffable pleasure this demonstration
of approval,” resumed Ricardo, after a long
pause; “and it gave me unspeakable delight to
behold the Peers themselves joining as enthusiastically
as the rest in those evidences of assent. When
all titles are abolished, save those which properly
and necessarily belong to the various grades of
naval and military rank, the vanity attending upon
the pride of birth will perish through a deserved
inanition, and emulation will point to the only true
aristocracy,&mdash;namely, that of <span class="smcap">Virtue</span> and of <span class="smcap">Mind</span>.
The Ministers will accordingly propose to you such
measures as may tend effectually to establish Republican
Institutions in this State. They will recommend
the abolition of the Upper House, and
the retention only of the Chamber of Deputies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
which must be numerically strengthened. They
will propose that the Chief Magistrate, to be denominated
<em>President</em>, shall be chosen for a period of
three years, and liable to re-election. The power
of <em>veto</em>, the privilege of making peace or declaring
war, and other attributes purely monarchical, will
not he conceded to the President, but must exist in
the Chamber itself; and instead of the effigy of the
ruler upon the current coin, the arms of the Republic
should be impressed. Every public act and
deed must be accomplished in the name of the
Sovereign People, the President serving the purpose
of the executive agent, as responsible for his
own conduct as the Ministers themselves are held
to be for theirs. These and other reforms, all tending
to the prompt and complete establishment of
pure Republican Institutions, will be at once submitted
to your deliberations.</p>

<p>“I have not the slightest doubt that the moment
the news of all that is passing within these walls,
shall reach the ears of the other potentates of Italy,
remonstrances will be poured in by their diplomatic
agents resident in Montoni;&mdash;and perhaps even
menaces may be used. I however feel convinced
that no argument which may be adopted in such
remonstrances can possibly blind your eyes to the
beauty of Freedom and the excellence of Liberty:
and as for the menaces, I need only observe that a
Castelcicalan army, animated by a republican spirit,
would prove invincible.”</p>

<p>These words again elicited the most tremendous
cheering: and after another long pause, Ricardo
wound up his address in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“All of you who are here present well remember
the condition of the country previously to the accession
of the late Grand Duke. Poverty, and its
invariable handmaids&mdash;squalor, filth and demoralisation&mdash;presided
over the lot of the industrious
classes. Oppression was felt everywhere&mdash;happiness
existed only in the mansions of a favoured few. The
people were looked upon as the serfs and slaves of
the rich oligarchy; and the very vitals of a healthy
state of society were thus corrupt and rotten. But
a change came over the country: it was decreed
that every man should have fair wages for fair work;
and that all able and willing to work, should have
work found for them. In order to accomplish
these aims, it was necessary to set about reclaiming
the waste lands in those districts where they lay;
and in others, the owners of estates were by a just
law compelled to throw certain portions of their
parks and pleasure-grounds into a corn cultivation,
and to level all their game-preserves for the
same purpose. What have been the results of these
measures? Labour has been abundant, and wages
high: employment has extirpated mendicancy; and
squalor, filth, and demoralisation exist no longer
within the confines of Castelcicala. But what
would I have you infer from these facts? That if
the people of this country have already so largely
and so admirably profited by liberal institutions,&mdash;if
the reforms hitherto accomplished have so materially
enhanced the general prosperity, producing
abundance, happiness, and contentment,&mdash;who shall
be able to divine to what point that prosperity may
arrive, under the pure, simple, and truly Christian
institutions of republicanism.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, with the tone, manner, and
eloquence of deep conviction, General Markham&mdash;for
so we must now denominate him&mdash;bowed to the
assembly, and withdrew amidst applause which
was prolonged for some minutes after he had
quitted the spacious hall.</p>

<p>His wife and illustrious relatives left the platform
at the same time;&mdash;and now behold this illustrious
family returning to the palace, attended by the
grateful and rejoicing myriads, who, having assembled
round the Chamber, had already received the
intelligence of the memorable proceedings that had
taken place within;&mdash;proceedings which in a single
hour had accomplished the most effectual and yet
utterly bloodless revolution ever known in any age
or in any country!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CXCIX">CHAPTER CXCIX.<br />

<span class="medium">THE MARCHIONESS OF DELMOUR.</span></h2>

<p>The Marquis of Delmour awoke, as it were from
a deep trance; and, opening his languid eyes, he
beheld a female form bending over him. He attempted
to speak: but the lady placed one slender
finger on her lips in token of silence;&mdash;and, closing
his eyes again, the old nobleman endeavoured to
collect his scattered ideas&mdash;or rather, to dispel the
mist which hung over them.</p>

<p>It struck him that the countenance which he had
just seen was not unknown to him;&mdash;and as he
dwelt upon it in imagination, it gradually became
more familiar,&mdash;while, by imperceptible degrees, it
awoke reminiscences of the past&mdash;some of pleasure,
but most of pain,&mdash;until an idea of the real truth
dawned in upon the mind of the Marquis.</p>

<p>Then again he opened his eyes;&mdash;and though long
years had elapsed since last he beheld that countenance,
each feature&mdash;each lineament was immediately
recognised. But so confused were his
thoughts that he could not recollect why a feeling
of aversion and repugnance prevented him from experiencing
joy at the presence of her who was standing,
in painful suspense, by his bed-side.</p>

<p>At last, as reason asserted her empire, a knowledge
of who she was and all the incidents associated
with her revived in his soul; while, at the
same time and with a species of under-current of
the reflections, a feeling of what had happened to
himself and why he was stretched in his couch came
slowly upon him. They he suddenly raised his
hand to his throat; and the bandage <em>there</em> convinced
him that the last reminiscence which had just
stolen into his mind, was indeed too true!</p>

<p>Averting his eyes from the mournful and plaintive
countenance which was still bending over him, he
groaned aloud in very bitterness:&mdash;and then a deep
silence ensued in the chamber.</p>

<p>Several minutes elapsed, during which the burning
tears streamed down the lady’s face: but she
subdued the sobs that almost choked her&mdash;for she
would not for worlds permit any evidence of her
own deep grief to disturb the meditations of the
enfeebled nobleman. On his side, he was absorbed
in profound thought,&mdash;the incidents of the past
rapidly becoming more definite and vivid in his
memory, until there were few things left in uncertainty
or doubt&mdash;and nothing in oblivion.</p>

<p>Slowly turning towards the lady, the Marquis
saw that she was overwhelmed with sorrow&mdash;although
she hastily wiped away her tears;&mdash;and
moved&mdash;deeply moved by this spectacle, as well as
influenced by a host of tender recollections, the old
man extended his hand towards her, murmuring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
“My wife! is it indeed she who is now watching
by my side?”</p>

<p>“O heaven! he recollects me&mdash;he will forgive
me!” she exclaimed, in a tone of the liveliest joy;
and carrying her husband’s emaciated hand to her
lips, she covered it with kisses.</p>

<p>“Sophia,” said the old man, in a low voice and
speaking with difficulty, “we meet after a long&mdash;long
separation. But let us forget the past&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that <em>you</em> can forget it?” asked
Mrs. Sefton&mdash;or rather the Marchioness of Delmour;
and bending her burning face over his hand which
she still retained in both her own, she added in a
tone so low that it seemed as if she feared even to
hear her own words, “You have so much to pardon!
But I never viewed my conduct in this light
until I came and beheld you stretched upon the bed
of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of death,” said the Marquis, his pale countenance
becoming, if possible, more ghastly pallid
still.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” exclaimed the Marchioness, with the
excitement of voice and the gesture of despair;
“you must not talk nor think thus despondingly!
But tell me, my husband&mdash;tell me&mdash;oh! say, can
you forgive me for the past?”</p>

<p>“We have much to forgive on either side, Sophia,”
responded the Marquis: “and as I was the first
cause of dissension between us&mdash;as I indeed was the
author of all your unhappiness, by forcing you into
a marriage which you abhorred&mdash;’tis for me to demand
pardon first. Tell me, then, Sophia&mdash;tell me
that you <em>can</em> pardon me for all the misery I have
been the wretched means of heaping upon your
head?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;yes!” exclaimed the lady, the tears
again pouring in torrents down her cheeks: “would
to heaven that I could prove to you how deeply
sensible I am of this kindness which you now manifest
towards me!”</p>

<p>“Then you forgive me!” cried the nobleman,
pressing her hand tenderly, while joy beamed in his
eyes hitherto dim with the glazing influence of a
mortal enervation:&mdash;“then you forgive me!” he
repeated, his voice becoming stronger.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;oh! yes&mdash;a thousand times <em>yes</em>!” she exclaimed;
and bending over him, she pressed her lips
upon his cold forehead. “But do you pardon me
likewise?” she asked, after a few moments’ pause.</p>

<p>“It was I who provoked all that has occurred&mdash;I
who was the unhappy means of blighting the pure
affections of your youth,” returned the Marquis;
“and therefore&mdash;whatever may have been the consequences&mdash;I
am bound to pardon and forget. Alas!
Sophia, often and often&mdash;and with feelings of ineffable
pain and anguish&mdash;have I thought of that
fatal day when, long years ago, I levelled at you a
terrible accusation. But I was a coward&mdash;and I
was cruel thus to have taxed you with a fault which
at that period my jealous suspicions alone&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To what do you allude?” demanded the Marchioness,
inwardly shocked, and with her heart
bleeding as she asked the question: for she divined
too well to what her husband <em>did</em> allude&mdash;and she
was almost crushed with a devouring sense of
shame.</p>

<p>“Oh! if you can have forgotten that fatal day,”
exclaimed the Marquis, whose sight was too dim,
and whose mental powers of perception were too
weak to enable him to understand rightly his wife’s
present emotions,&mdash;“then are you happy indeed!
For, alas! I referred to the day on which we separated,
sixteen or seventeen years ago&mdash;I cannot now
remember accurately how many have passed since
then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And why allude to that unhappy epoch?” asked
the lady, in a low and tremulous tone.</p>

<p>“Because I wish to convince you that I am indeed
repentant for all the share which I took in
sealing our misery,” replied the nobleman. “On
that memorable day, I accused you of infidelity
towards me&mdash;and yet subsequent reflection has convinced
me that you were innocent <em>then</em>! Oh! never&mdash;never
shall I forget that tone in which you
breathed the fatal words&mdash;‘<em>All is now at an end
between you and me! We part&mdash;for ever!</em>’ I have
thought since&mdash;aye, and I have said that you resembled
what would be a sculptor’s or an artist’s
conception of <em>Injured Innocence</em>; and then, when I
adjured you in the name of your infant daughter to
stay, you uttered a wild cry and fled! That cry
rings in my ears now&mdash;has vibrated in my brain
ever since&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! in the name of heaven, proceed not thus!”
murmured the Marchioness, covering her face with
her hands and sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>But wherefore, did she thus weep?&mdash;wherefore
were her emotions so powerful? Why was her
heart thus wrung until every fibre appeared to be
stretched to its utmost power of tension? It was
because on the occasion to which the Marquis referred,
<em>guilt</em> and not <em>innocence</em> had made her voice
hollow and thick as she breathed the words which
decreed an eternal separation!&mdash;it was because that
wild cry had been wrung from her by the appeal
that was made in the name of the infant child whom
she knew to be the offspring of her amour with Sir
Gilbert Heathcote! But there are times when
<em>Conscious Guilt</em> so much resembles <em>Injured Innocence</em>,
that the most keen observer may be deceived;&mdash;and
such was the fact in the case now alluded to.</p>

<p>A long pause ensued&mdash;during which the Marquis,
still totally ignorant of the real nature of his wife’s
emotions, gazed upon her with an affectionate interest
that was rapidly growing into a resuscitated
love.</p>

<p>“Weep not, dearest,” he at length said;&mdash;“weep
not, I implore you!”</p>

<p>“I weep, because I feel that I am so completely
unworthy of your present kindness,” responded the
Marchioness, withdrawing her hands from her
face, and bending her tearful eyes with an expression
of such mournfulness and such profound penitence
upon her husband, that had he the power to
raise himself in the bed, he would have snatched her
to his bosom.</p>

<p>“It is now my turn to implore you not to
dwell longer upon the past,” he said, taking one of
her hands and conveying it to his lips. “We have
promised mutual forgiveness. You have pardoned
me for forcing you into a marriage which caused all
your unhappiness: and I have pardoned you for
your connexion with Sir Gilbert Heathcote since the
period of our separation. This is the understanding
between us, Sophia&mdash;and now we are friends again.
But tell me, my dear wife&mdash;tell me how long I have
been stretched on this bed, and how you came thus
to be here to minister unto me?”</p>

<p>“Four days have elapsed since you&mdash;since&mdash;”
began the Marchioness, hesitating how to allude to
the dreadful attempt at suicide which her husband
had committed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>“Oh! name not the horrible deed!” he groaned
forth, writhing in anguish.</p>

<p>“But it is not known&mdash;save to three or four persons,”
hastily observed his wife, well aware that
this assurance would prove consolatory.</p>

<p>“Heaven be thanked!” murmured the old nobleman,
clasping his hands fervently. “And now tell
me, my dear Sophia, how you came to learn the
shocking intelligence?”</p>

<p>“If you will compose yourself as much as you can,
and speak but little, I will explain every thing to
you,” she answered, assuming, with captivating tenderness
of tone and manner, the position of wife
and nurse.</p>

<p>“One word first!” exclaimed the Marquis.
“Agnes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is here&mdash;beneath your roof,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“My daughter again near me!” he murmured, joy
animating his countenance: but in another moment
a cloud overspread his features, as he said hesitatingly,
“Does she know of the dreadful attempt that
I made upon my life?”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” ejaculated the Marchioness,
shocked at the bare idea. “That circumstance
has been religiously withheld from her. She is
however now aware that she is the daughter of the
Marquis of Delmour, and not of plain Mr. Vernon;
and she believes you to be dangerously ill. She has
indeed been my companion for hours together by
your bed-side&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dearest Agnes!” exclaimed the nobleman, with
an effusion of tenderness in his tone. “I will see
her presently&mdash;when I am more composed,” he
added. “And now give me the promised explanations
relative to all I have asked you.”</p>

<p>“Listen, then, my dear husband&mdash;and do not
interrupt me. Yon have already spoken too much,
considering your depressed and enfeebled state;
and Sir John Lascelles, when he calls again, will
be angry with me for permitting you to use such
exertions. Oh! you know not how kind&mdash;how
attentive he has been! But you will shortly have
an opportunity of thanking him with your own
lips&mdash;for he will be here in an hour. Though the
room be darkened, it is now about eleven o’clock in
the morning; and he will call at noon. Compose
yourself, therefore; and I will give you all the
details you require.”</p>

<p>The Marchioness arranged her husband’s pillows&mdash;kissed
his forehead once more&mdash;and then, seating
herself by his bed-side, proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That excellent young nobleman, Lord William
Trevelyan, called upon me a few days ago, in consequence
of an interview which he had had with
you. It was relative to Agnes. I assured him
that Sir Gilbert Heathcote and myself had come to
an understanding that we should see each other no
more; and I likewise informed Lord William that
it was my intention to repair with Agnes to the
Continent. But after he had taken his departure,
I reflected profoundly upon the plans I had somewhat
too hastily determined to adopt;&mdash;and another
project suggested itself. For you may believe me
when I solemnly avow that all my solicitude was
relative to Agnes. Her present happiness and her
future welfare in the world alone occupied my attention.
Thus was it that the thought stole into
my mind, of how unfortunate it was for her to be
separated from the father whom she loved so well,
and how prejudicial to her interests the equivocal
position of her mother was likely to become. Then
I resolved to see <em>you</em>&mdash;to throw myself upon your
mercy&mdash;to implore forgiveness for the past&mdash;and to
beseech you that we might all dwell once again
beneath the same roof! For I reflected that as
you had shown so much forbearance in never appealing
to the courts of justice to divorce me
legally&mdash;and as you had rather manifested every
inclination to envelope in secrecy the causes of our
unfortunate differences,&mdash;the conviction gained
upon my mind that you were generous enough to
be capable of still farther sacrifices for the sake of
Agnes. Oh! you can comprehend a mother’s
solicitude, my dear husband&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: proceed!” exclaimed the Marquis,
powerfully affected.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;animated with the hopes inspired by
all these considerations,” resumed the Marchioness,
“I passed the night in meditating upon
the best course to adopt in order to procure an
interview with you,&mdash;an interview after so long
a separation! At length I determined to pen a
brief note, stating that family affairs of the utmost
importance to us both had induced me to take this
step; and a letter to that effect did I accordingly
write on the following morning. But when I had
completed this much of my task, another idea
struck me,&mdash;which was to become the personal
bearer of my own note. I will now candidly admit
that I shrank from undertaking a task which might
appear to you to evince a matchless audacity and
presumption; but when I thought of Agnes, I resolved
to risk any mortification or shame which
could possibly be inflicted upon me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no mortification&mdash;no shame!” cried the
nobleman. “Would to heaven that you had only
come in time to&mdash;&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed the Marchioness, placing
her finger upon her lip: “you promised that you
would listen, without exerting yourself to speak.”</p>

<p>“Proceed, dearest,” said the Marquis, who all
this while had one of his wife’s hands locked in his
own.</p>

<p>“Summoning all my courage to my aid,” she resumed,
“I resolved on presenting myself at your
abode. I arrived&mdash;I sent up the letter by your valet:
but in a few minutes he came rushing down the
stairs with a countenance that had horror depicted
in every lineament. I shall not however dwell
upon this portion of my adventure. You may probably
conjecture how dreadful was my alarm&mdash;how
great my grief, when I learnt from the broken sentences
in which the man spoke, the frightful intelligence
of the condition in which he had found
you. Then I revealed to him who I was; and, recovering
my presence of mind, bade him place a
seal on his lips with regard to every one save the
doctor, whom I dispatched him to fetch. In a few
moments I was with you: I stanched the blood&mdash;I
did all that an unassisted and inexperienced
woman could do in such a case. Sir John Lascelles
arrived&mdash;and the information he gave me,
after inspecting the wound, was reassuring. I then
resolved to remain with you; and I sent the valet
to fetch Agnes. This is all the explanation that
I have to give;&mdash;unless indeed I should add that
I communicated with Lord William Trevelyan, who,
as a generous friend and as the intended husband
of Agnes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Has he visited this chamber?” asked the old
nobleman, hastily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “Considering that he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
alike in your confidence and in mine, I did not think
it either grateful or prudent to leave him unacquainted
with all that had occurred. The secret
therefore rests with him, the good physician, the
valet, and myself; and the household generally
believes that you were found in a fit, which has
been followed by a dangerous illness.”</p>

<p>“My dearest wife,” said the Marquis, after a long
pause, “were there no circumstances which compelled
me, as an honest man, to ask <em>your</em> pardon
for the past, in the same way as you have demanded
and obtained my forgiveness,&mdash;all that you have
now told me would efface from my memory every
thing that it had ever cherished to your prejudice.
The delicacy you have displayed&mdash;your generosity&mdash;your
watchfulness&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;I cannot permit you thus to exert yourself,”
interrupted the Marchioness, placing her
hand upon his mouth.</p>

<p>“But you <em>must</em> permit me to declare how deep is
the gratitude that I experience for your conduct
towards me,” he said. “Oh! my beloved wife&mdash;for
so I must again call you&mdash;I was mad at the
time when I laid violent hands upon myself!”</p>

<p>“Oh! speak not of <em>that</em>!” exclaimed the lady.
“My God! was it in consequence of that last interview
which you had with Trevelyan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” interrupted the Marquis: “do not
blame yourself in any way! It was <em>not</em> on account
of the determination which you had expressed, and
which he explained to me, to retain Agnes in your
care. No&mdash;alas! a far less worthy cause&mdash;&mdash;But
tell me,” he exclaimed, suddenly checking himself,
as an idea struck him: “has there been any communication
made from my bankers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do not harass yourself with matters of business,”
said the Marchioness, in a tone expressive of
the deepest solicitude.</p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;if I am to endure the tortures of suspense,
I shall never recover,” exclaimed the nobleman,
with strong emphasis. “Besides, I see by
your manner that something <em>has</em> occurred, Sophia&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I will explain every thing,” said the
Marchioness; “and then your mind will be relieved:
for I see that it is useless to expect you to compose
yourself while any cause of vexation or excitement
exists. Tranquillise your mind, therefore, relative
to the matter which is now uppermost in your
thoughts. Your honour has been duly cared for&mdash;no
exposure has given existence to shame or humiliation.”</p>

<p>“Oh! again&mdash;again I thank you, my generous
wife,” cried the Marquis. “But pray give me an
explanation of all this!”</p>

<p>“I will do so without farther preface,” she said.
“In the course of the day following the mournful
one whose chief incident made me an inmate of the
house to which I only came in the first instance as
a visitor, the principal partner in the banking firm
in the Strand called with an earnest request to see
you immediately. In pursuance of certain orders
which I had given to the servants relative to any
visitors who might come upon business, I was immediately
made acquainted with the banker’s presence;
and I hastened to the room where he was
waiting. I assured him that you had been seized
with a sudden fit, and were unable to see any one;
and, as I had already made myself known in the
house as your wife, I informed him that I was the
Marchioness of Delmour. He said that it was of
the greatest consequence for him to see you; and I
replied that you were insensible to all that was
passing around you. He appeared much annoyed&mdash;indeed
bewildered by this announcement; and I
conjured him to be candid with me. He then stated
that a forgery had been committed upon the bank,
your name having been already used to procure the
sum of sixty thousand pounds; that the legitimate
owner of the cheque had just called to obtain the
cash, and was actually waiting at the bank at that
instant; and that he himself had come to require
final instructions from <em>you</em>, as the lady was resolute
in enforcing her demand. Pardon me, my husband,”
continued the Marchioness, “if I tell you I suspected
that the affair was one which you would be
unwilling to have exposed; and, indeed, on a little
farther conversation with the banker, I heard sufficient
to convince me that such was the fact. I
accordingly took it upon myself to desire him to
effect a compromise with the lady in question: but
she being obstinate, he paid the entire amount. This
result he subsequently called to communicate to
me; and I hope that you will at least approve of
my motives, if not of the instructions that I gave.”</p>

<p>“I approve of both,” answered the Marquis;
“and I again thank you, Sophia, for the delicacy
which you have exhibited in my behalf.”</p>

<p>At this moment a knock at the door of the
chamber was heard; and Sir John Lascelles immediately
afterwards made his appearance.</p>

<p>The worthy physician was much delighted at the
sudden and unexpected improvement which had
manifested itself in his patient: and, after a few
inquiries of a purely professional nature, he turned
towards the Marchioness, saying, “To her ladyship,
my lord, are you indebted for your life. Her
prompt attention and the singular presence of
mind with which she adopted the proper&mdash;indeed,
the only effectual course, immediately after the discovery
of your alarming condition&mdash;saved your
lordship from a speedy death. During the four days
and four nights which have elapsed since the occurrence,”
continued Sir John Lascelles, alluding as
delicately as he could to the attempted suicide,
“her ladyship has been constant and unwearied in
her attendance at your bed-side. In order to retain
the sad secret within as narrow a circle as possible,
her ladyship would not even permit a nurse
to be engaged;&mdash;but, unassisted, she has sustained
all the cares&mdash;all the anxieties&mdash;and all the fatigues
inevitably associated with daily watchings and long
vigils. Pardon me, madam, for speaking thus enthusiastically;
but, throughout my experience,
which embraces a lengthened series of years, I
never&mdash;never beheld such devotion.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, doctor,” said the nobleman, “for
dwelling with such emphasis upon conduct as
noble as it is generous. Certain differences&mdash;trifling
in reality, and all in consequence of faults on
<em>my</em> side,” continued the Marquis, “had long kept us
apart. But we are now reunited, never again to separate
until Death shall lay his hand upon me,
Doctor,” added the nobleman, after a short pause,&mdash;while
the Marchioness was weeping through deep
emotion,&mdash;“should you ever hear any one allude to
our protracted separation, I beg&mdash;I implore you to
declare, upon the authority of my own avowal, that
I alone was the offending party, and that her ladyship
has generously forgiven me every thing.”</p>

<p>“I shall not wait to hear people allude to this
matter, ere I myself broach the subject, in order to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
volunteer that explanation,” said Sir John Lascelles,
who, firmly believing all that the Marquis had uttered,
naturally considered that the most ample justice
should be done towards a lady who had exhibited
such a noble devotion to her husband under
such peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>When the physician had taken his leave, after
prescribing certain medicines and giving the instructions
necessary in the case, the Marchioness
bent over her husband, and with deeply blushing
countenance, said, “If there were anything at all
deserving of praise in my conduct, yours is beyond
all commendation: for I have merely performed a
duty&mdash;whereas you have proved yourself to be the
most generous of men. Oh! how can I ever sufficiently
thank you, my dear husband, for having
thus disarmed scandal of its weapons&mdash;thereby
saving my honour even from the faintest breath of
suspicion? And in order to do this, you have taken
upon yourself the odium which attaches itself to the
separation of man and wife.”</p>

<p>“I need&mdash;I deserve no thanks,” said the Marquis.
“You have saved my life&mdash;you have recalled me to
existence: to you am I indebted for that leisure
which, by God’s mercy, may yet be afforded me
wherein to repent of the heinous crime I have
committed in laying violent hands upon myself.
Sir John Lascelles goes much into society&mdash;he is intimate
in all the first houses at the West End: and
he will be careful to propagate the intelligence
which I gave him. You may therefore hold up your
head proudly, Sophia: for <em>your</em> secret is also retained
within as narrow a circle as my own. And now
as you have eased my mind on so many points, let
me relieve you from any shadow of uncertainty that
may hang over yours, in respect to the cause of this
dreadful deed, the fatal results of which were
averted only by your timely aid. It was through
disappointment in respect to that very lady who
presented herself at my bankers’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough!” exclaimed the Marchioness: “we
have already had too many painful revelations this
day,” she added, in a low and affectionate tone. “If
you are now strong enough to see her, I will fetch
Agnes to remain with us for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>The Marquis joyfully assented; and Sophia,
having arranged the collar of his linen in such a
manner that the bandage on the throat could not
be observed, quitted the room. She however almost
immediately returned, followed by her daughter,
who was overwhelmed with delight to find him
whom she believed to be her father so much improved.</p>

<p>But when the Marchioness contemplated the
heart-felt joy with which her husband welcomed
Agnes to his arms, she was stricken with remorse
at the deceit she was practising upon him,&mdash;permitting
him to regard that beauteous girl as his own
offspring! Could she, however, destroy an illusion
which gave him so much delight, and was the
source of so much happiness?&mdash;will our readers
blame her for cherishing this secret in her own
breast, instead of uselessly destroying the fabric of
domestic peace which had once more been built up
in that lordly mansion?</p>

<p>After this interview with Agnes, the Marquis
shortly fell into a deep and refreshing slumber,
which continued until the evening.</p>

<p>On the following morning he was so much
farther improved, that when Trevelyan called,
he insisted upon seeing that good young nobleman,
who was delighted beyond measure to find that
such a signal change had taken place in his
condition.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CC">CHAPTER CC.<br />

<span class="medium">JACK RILY AND THE LAWYER’S CLERK.</span></h2>

<p>It was about nine in the evening, and Mr. John
Rily, <em>alias</em> the Doctor, was seated in his chamber at
the house in Roupel Street, smoking his pipe and
pondering upon the best mode of disposing of the
Bank-notes that were in his possession.</p>

<p>He had seen by the newspapers that his late
companion, Mrs. Mortimer, had died from the
effects of the terrible punishment inflicted upon her
by Vitriol Bob: but he had not observed any advertisement
proclaiming the notes that had been
derived from the forgery;&mdash;and the journals were
likewise silent respecting the forgery itself.</p>

<p>The Doctor accordingly concluded that the fraud
remained undetected, and that the legitimate cheque
had not been presented; and as several days had
now elapsed since the notes had found their way
into his possession, he began seriously to meditate
how he could convert them into gold.</p>

<p>It may seem a singular thing to some that a man
having in his possession sixty thousand pounds’
<em>worth</em>, was at a loss for the means to realise the
amount: but such is often the predicament in which
thieves are placed.</p>

<p>For thus stood the matter in respect to Jack
Rily:&mdash;If he were to take a quantity of the notes to
the Bank of England, his appearance might be so
much against him as to excite suspicion: for he was
not endowed with vanity sufficient to blind his eyes
to the fact that his outward aspect was of the most
villanously hang-dog description it was possible to
conceive. Besides, he was not certain that the notes
might not have been privately stopped. Again, if
he applied to the “fences” and receivers of stolen
property with whom he was acquainted, he knew
that they could not cash more than two or three
thousand pounds’ worth of the notes; and in doing
even this much, they might mulct him of one-half
the value. Besides, they were only to be trusted
by men in such desperate circumstances as to leave
no other alternative: whereas the Doctor had plenty
of gold remaining from his share of the plunder
derived from the adventure in the Haunted Houses.
Lastly in the catalogue of difficulties now enumerated,
Jack Rily had heard from a friend so much
of the galleys in France, that he did not at all relish
the idea of repairing to that country and standing
the chance of visiting those places by attempting to
pass notes concerning which private information
might have been sent, for any thing he knew to the
contrary, to the various money-changers.</p>

<p>All these considerations were occupying the
Doctor’s thoughts on the evening alluded to; when
his landlord entered to acquaint him that a gentleman
named Green desired to speak to him.</p>

<p>“Ah! my old school-pal!” ejaculated Rily, joyfully:
“show him up by all means!”</p>

<p>And during the short interval which elapsed ere
the attorney’s clerk made his appearance, the Doctor
placed the brandy-bottle, a couple of tumblers, and
a clean pipe upon the table.</p>

<p>By the time these preparations were completed,
Mr. Green entered the room, and was received with
the familiarity of a long-standing acquaintance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

<p>“Well, it is quite an age since I saw you last!”
exclaimed the Doctor, as soon as his visitor was
seated. “What have you been doing with yourself?
Still drudging on at old Heathcote’s?”</p>

<p>“Just the same&mdash;or rather worse,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” observed the Doctor.
“Come, help yourself. But how came you to find
me out in my new quarters?”</p>

<p>“I was passing by here yesterday to serve a writ
upon a poor devil in this street,” answered Mr.
Green, “and I twigged you at the window. You
didn’t see me: but I made up my mind to give you
a call&mdash;and so here I am.”</p>

<p>“And I feel devilish glad to see you,” responded
Jack Rily. “You may observe that my circumstances
have improved a trifle or so, of late.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I wish to heaven that <em>mine</em> would show
any proof of amendment,” said Green, with a profound
sigh, as he helped himself to a tumbler of
brandy-and-water. “I made a couple of hundred
pounds the other day&mdash;it was an affair of giving information
about a lunatic-asylum in which Heathcote
had locked up his own brother;&mdash;and because
I treated myself to this new suit of clothes,” he
added, glancing down at his dress, “the old villain
declared that I must have robbed him to procure
the money. Oh! how I long to be revenged on
that man!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t suppose it’s so very difficult,”
observed Rily: “at least I should think, from all
you have told me at different times, that you know
enough about him to make him quake in his
shoes.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but&mdash;then,” stammered the clerk,
with the hesitation of one who longs to open his
heart to another, yet shrinks from the avowal of a
villany even to the ears of a villain.</p>

<p>“But what?” demanded the Doctor, relighting
his pipe. “If you’ve come to consult me, then out
with everything at once. Do nothing by halves,
old fellow&mdash;I never do.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see&mdash;the truth is&mdash;that&mdash;I&mdash;I am in
the man’s power&mdash;completely in his power,” responded
Green: “and now he’s making my life so
wretched&mdash;oh! so wretched, that I think of running
away to America with my two hundred
pounds. But then I know that he would move
heaven and earth to find me out; he would advertise
me&mdash;give a description of my person&mdash;swear
that I had robbed him, or something of that kind;&mdash;anything,
indeed, would he do to revenge himself
upon me. He is one of those despicable characters
that cherish the bitterest&mdash;the most fiend-like
malignity.”</p>

<p>“And what is he doing to you now?” demanded
Jack, smoking his pipe at his ease while
his friend was thus pouring forth his complaints.</p>

<p>“What doesn’t he do, you should rather ask
me,” exclaimed Green, in a tone of mingled rage,
hate, and despair. “As I just now told you, he
put his brother Sir Gilbert into a lunatic asylum,
in the hope of getting into his own hands the
management of all the baronet’s property&mdash;and
doubtless in the expectation likewise that grief
would send the unfortunate gentleman to his last
home. Well, Sir Gilbert escaped&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Through your connivance, eh?” interrupted
the Doctor, with a knowing chuckle.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;with my connivance,” responded Green;
“and it is the suspicion of this fact that makes
Heathcote so intolerable in his conduct towards
me. Besides, seeing me with a new suit of clothes,
he swore that if I had not robbed him I must have
been bribed to give information relative to the
place where his brother was confined. It was all
in vain that I reminded him of my salary being quite
sufficient to keep me in decent attire&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see,” again interrupted the
Doctor,&mdash;“when once a man has got a certain suspicion
into his head, he won’t very easily part with
it. He cherishes it&mdash;feeds upon it&mdash;sleeps upon it&mdash;dreams
of it, just as a young girl does of her first
love.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that this must be the case,” said
Green. “At all events, I have been made so miserable
by Heathcote for the last few days, that it was
like a ray of hope when I saw you at the window
of this room yesterday; and I determined to come
and chat with you over the matter.”</p>

<p>“And yet I don’t see very well how I can assist
you, since you declare that you are completely in
Heathcote’s power,” observed Jack Rily. “But
you must tell me every thing.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;there’s no use in denying, then, that
Heathcote can transport me if he chooses,” said
Green. “Some years ago I&mdash;I&mdash;committed&mdash;a&mdash;a
forgery&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s nothing,” exclaimed Jack, assuming
a consolatory tone. “But go on.”</p>

<p>“Nothing do you call it!” cried the clerk, looking
apprehensively around him, as if he were fearful
that the very walls had ears. “In a month’s
time a thousand pounds must be forthcoming&mdash;or I
shall be transported. Up to this time Heathcote
has all along given me to understand that he will
replace the money for me: but this business of his
brother’s escape and two or three other matters
that have gone wrong with him lately&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand you,” said Jack Rily: “they have
put the kyebosh upon it.”</p>

<p>“The what?” demanded Green, unskilled in slang
phrases.</p>

<p>“Put a stopper on the affair, I mean,” explained
the Doctor, whom an idea had struck while his companion
was talking; and this idea was that Mr.
Green might be made instrumental in procuring
cash for a considerable portion of the Bank-notes.</p>

<p>“I am indeed afraid that Heathcote will not
assist me,” pursued the wretched clerk; “and if
he does not, I cannot say what will become of me.
In fact there is no use in buoying myself up with
the hope that Heathcote <em>will</em> do any thing for me:
he himself has lost money lately in several ways&mdash;and
moreover his temper is terribly soured by this
affair about his brother.”</p>

<p>“Is Sir Gilbert taking steps to punish him, then?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh! no&mdash;he is too generous and too forgiving
in his disposition,” replied Green: “but he has compelled
the two surgeons who signed the certificate
of insanity, to give him a counter-declaration&mdash;and
indeed a confession to the effect that they were
bribed to sign the document on the strength of
which he was placed in the mad-house. There is
consequently the danger of all this becoming
known; and Heathcote, finding his reputation to
be hanging by a thread, has grown as it were desperate,&mdash;not
caring what may happen to himself&mdash;still
less what may befall <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“I should think, then, that if you had a thousand
pounds, you would fancy yourself a very lucky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
fellow, and be able to defy Heathcote altogether,”
observed Jack Rily.</p>

<p>“I would give the last ten years of my life to
reach such happiness,” said the clerk. “But it is
useless&mdash;vain to hope&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will you give a few hours of your time and a
little of your ingenuity?” demanded the Doctor,
now fixing upon him a look full of deep and mysterious
meaning.</p>

<p>“Do not banter me&mdash;do not make a jest of my
misfortune,” exclaimed Green.</p>

<p>“By Satan! I never was more serious in my life,”
returned the Doctor. “Nay&mdash;you may stare at me
as you will: but the thousand pounds are nearer
within your reach than you fancy&mdash;and you might
still keep your two hundred pounds for your own
purposes.”</p>

<p>“Pray explain yourself!” cried the clerk, not
daring to yield to the hope which suddenly appeared
to rise up before him. “Keep me not in suspense,
I conjure you! Can you do anything for me?&mdash;can
you put me into the way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I can,” answered the Doctor, emphatically.
“And now you may as well tell me candidly that
you thought I <em>might</em> be able to assist you, when you
resolved upon calling here. Because, since we were
at school together&mdash;which is many long years ago&mdash;our
paths in life have been so different, that it is
not very likely you would have honoured me by
your company without some pressing motive.”</p>

<p>“You must at the same time admit that whenever
I have met you, I have always spoken civilly to
you&mdash;and sometimes stood treat,” added Green,
diffidently.</p>

<p>“Once or twice,” observed Jack. “But that don’t
matter one way or the other. I asked you a question:
and before I open my mind any farther&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I candidly admit, then,” interrupted
Green, wishing to bring the matter to the point as
speedily as possible&mdash;“I candidly admit that I <em>did</em>
hope you could help me in some way or another.
But it was only the hope of a desperate man: for as
to the idea that you could assist me to eight hundred
or a thousand pounds, it would have been insane
to harbour it even for an instant. To speak
more frankly still, I almost thought of asking you
to let me join you in your own way of life, although
I hardly know what your pursuits positively are.”</p>

<p>“They require courage and firmness, at all events,”
answered Jack Rily, with a coarse laugh; “whereas
you have got into such cursed cringing, bowing, and
scraping ways, that you are only fit for a toad-eater.
Excuse me for speaking frankly&mdash;but as we are
talking on matters of business&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quite correct,” interrupted Green, swallowing
his resentment: for he felt but little pleased at the
home-truth which had just been told him. “And
now for the information which is to relieve me from
such cruel suspense.”</p>

<p>“First answer me one or two questions,” said
the Doctor. “I suppose you are often in the habit
of changing Bank-notes for your master?”</p>

<p>“Yes: but not to any considerable amount at a
time,” answered Green: “he is too suspicious to
trust me with a sum sufficiently large to tempt me
to run away with it.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I suppose you could manage to
change a few heavy notes, if you had them?” pursued
the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Heavy notes?” repeated Green, turning pale
and trembling. “Are they&mdash;fo&mdash;or&mdash;ged?”</p>

<p>“Not they!” exclaimed Rily, half disgusted with
his timorous companion. “They are genuine Bank
of England flimsies: but as they didn’t come into
my hands in a very regular manner, and as my appearance
isn’t altogether in my favour, I can’t pass
them myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I&mdash;I&mdash;can get cash for them,” said Green,
with all the eagerness of a man in a desperate predicament.
“Heathcote’s bankers would do me as
many as you can possibly have.”</p>

<p>“I question it,” observed the Doctor, drily.
“Would they cash you two notes for a thousand
each?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: assuredly they would,” was the
prompt answer.</p>

<p>“And you must know other places&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Several&mdash;several,” interrupted Green, anticipating
the remainder of the questions. “But would
it not be shorter to go to the Bank of England at
once?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I think it would,” responded Jack.</p>

<p>“Unless&mdash;unless&mdash;there’s any fear&mdash;any danger,
I mean&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Curse upon your fears and dangers!” ejaculated
the hare-lipped villain, savagely: “there are
none at all&mdash;only, as I just now said, I can’t go
myself. But if you can get ten thousand changed
to-morrow, you may have one thousand for your
own purposes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Green could not find words to express his
gratitude in return for this assurance: he was overwhelmed
with a delight which he had not experienced
for years. The thought of emancipating
himself from the thraldom of his despot-master
was too brilliant&mdash;too dazzling to gaze upon. He
could not believe that there was anything beyond
a mere chance in his favour:&mdash;that the matter was
a certainty, he dared not imagine.</p>

<p>But when Jack Rily displayed a few of the notes,
and mysteriously hinted that they were the produce
of a forgery which could not possibly be detected,
Mr. Green started from his chair, and actually
danced for joy!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CCI">CHAPTER CCI.<br />

<span class="medium">MR. HEATHCOTE AND HIS CLERK.</span></h2>

<p>It was five o’clock in the morning of the day after
the interview described in the last chapter; and Mr.
Heathcote was seated at the writing-table in his
private office.</p>

<p>He was busily occupied with papers;&mdash;for his was
a disposition that could not endure idleness. Even
when vexed and annoyed&mdash;as he was at present&mdash;it
was impossible for him to remain inactive. Had he
been an author, he would have eclipsed Walter
Scott or Paul de Koek in the number of his works.</p>

<p>There was a deep gloom upon his brow and a
sinister light in his restless eyes, as he bent over the
parchment-deeds which he was inspecting; and
from time to time he cast an anxious glance towards
the door.</p>

<p>At length be rang the bell; and the junior clerk
answered the summons.</p>

<p>“Has not Mr. Green made his appearance <em>yet</em>?”
demanded the lawyer, with an emphasis on the last
word.</p>

<p>“No, sir&mdash;he has not,” was the reply, given timidly&mdash;for
the young man beheld both the gloom on the
brow and the gleaming in the eye.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span></p>

<div id="i_385" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_385.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Not yet!” ejaculated Heathcote, fiercely, and
frowning in his own peculiar fashion at the same
time. “Nor sent either?” he added, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” responded the junior clerk.</p>

<p>“This is strange&mdash;very strange,” murmured the
lawyer. “He can’t be ill&mdash;poor devils like him cannot
afford to be unwell. But if he were,&mdash;if he <em>did</em>
happen to be so indisposed that be couldn’t shut his
eyes to the fact,&mdash;he would have sent word. You
know where he lives? demanded Mr. Heathcote,
abruptly addressing himself to the young
man.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then go to his lodgings directly,” exclaimed the
lawyer, in an imperious tone; “and if you find him
at home, tell him that I am very angry indeed at
his absence. Should he be ill, you must desire him
to get out of bed, take a cab, and come to me at
once to give an account of his conduct. Two guineas
a-week, indeed, to a fellow who takes it into
his head to be ill!”</p>

<p>And with this humane reflection Mr. Heathcote
was about to resume his work, while the young
clerk was turning towards the door, when Mr.
Green suddenly made his appearance.</p>

<p>“Oh! you are come at last, sir&mdash;are you?” cried
the lawyer, glancing up at the clock. “A quarter
past five&mdash;and the office hours are from nine till
six. What the deuce does this mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“I had a little business to transact, sir,” answered
the head clerk, closing the door by which the junior
functionary had just evaporated.</p>

<p>“A little business!” repeated Mr. Heathcote,
staring at the man in unfeigned amazement: for he
could not possibly conceive how Mr. Green should
have any affairs of his own to attend to.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;a little business,” returned the head
clerk, who, though now feeling comparatively independent
of his master could not shake off an obsequiousness
of manner, which had become habitual
to him. “Is it strange, sir, that for once in a way
I should have taken the holiday which was certain
to be refused if solicited beforehand?”</p>

<p>“Have you been drinking, Mr. Green&mdash;or are
you mad&mdash;to talk to me in this style?” demanded
Heathcote, surveying his clerk with more than
usual attention.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span></p>

<p>“I have had nothing to drink, sir, beyond a
single glass of sherry&mdash;and I beg to inform you that
I am <em>not</em> crazy,” answered the head clerk, growing
a trifle bolder.</p>

<p>“A glass of sherry!” repeated Heathcote, again
evincing the most unfeigned astonishment. “How
is it possible, sir, that you can indulge in such
extravagances and pay for them honestly? A few
days ago you ventured to appear before me in a
new suit of clothes, with the gloss actually on
them&mdash;whereas your regular office-suit had not
been thread-bare more than two years. Let me tell
you, sir, that I take note of these things: I observe
the most minute symptoms of change in a man’s
character or habits; and no one can deceive <em>me</em>, Mr.
Green&mdash;no one can deceive <em>me</em>,” repeated the lawyer,
looking hard at the individual whom he thus
addressed, as much as to say that he had suspected
something wrong and was now certain of it.</p>

<p>“Well, sir&mdash;and who has attempted to deceive
you?” asked Green, in a bolder tone than had ever
yet characterised his language when in the presence
of his hitherto dreaded master.</p>

<p>“Who has attempted to deceive me!” vociferated
Heathcote, his lips becoming white and quivering
with rage. “You, sir&mdash;<em>you</em> have made the endeavour&mdash;you
are making it now! But it will not do,
Mr. Green&mdash;it will not do. Take care of yourself!
New suits of clothes&mdash;sherry&mdash;a day’s absence without
leave, and even without the humble apology
that should mark your return,&mdash;all this is suspicious,
sir&mdash;very suspicious, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>“Suspicious of what?” demanded the head clerk,
approaching Mr. Heathcote’s desk, and looking
steadily across it at that gentleman.</p>

<p>“That you were either bribed in my brother’s
affair&mdash;or that you have robbed me,” was the immediate
answer.</p>

<p>“You are a liar, sir&mdash;a deliberate liar,” exclaimed
Green, now beginning to experience the first feelings
of exultation at the independence which he
was enabled to assert.</p>

<p>The lawyer could make no reply: he was amazed&mdash;bewildered&mdash;stupefied!</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” continued Green, his voice now losing
all its obsequiousness and his manner rising completely
above servility,&mdash;“you are a liar if you say
that I robbed you! Where was the chance, even
if I had possessed the inclination, of pilfering even
a single farthing? You know that you reckon up
the office-money to the very last penny&mdash;and that if
I tell you how a box of lucifers, or a piece of tape,
or any other trifling article was required, you were
always sure to say we were very extravagant in that
front-office. These are truths, sir; and therefore how
dare you pretend to believe in the possibility of my
robbing you?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Green&mdash;Mr. Green,” exclaimed Heathcote,
absolutely frightened at his head clerk’s manner:
“what is the cause of all this excitement?”</p>

<p>The lawyer was frightened, we say,&mdash;because his
conscience told him that something had occurred to
place Mr. Green upon a more independent footing
with regard to him; and the greater became such
independence on the part of one who had long
been his tool and instrument, the less secure was
the lawyer himself in his own position. In fact,
when a wretched being who had long grovelled in
the dust at his feet, suddenly started up and dared
to look him in the face,&mdash;it was a sign that the
fabric of despotism was shaken and was tottering
to its fall. Mr. Heathcote felt all this&mdash;and he
trembled for a moment,&mdash;trembled with a cold and
death-like shudder, as he beheld his clerk’s eyes
glaring savagely at him; and it was under the influence
of this sensation that he uttered the words
which, by proving his own weakness, gave Green
additional courage.</p>

<p>“You ask what is the cause of all this excitement,”
exclaimed the latter: “and yet only a few
minutes have elapsed since you dared to accuse me
of having robbed you.”</p>

<p>“A man who has committed a forgery, may very
well be suspected of theft,” returned Heathcote,
who, having recovered his presence of mind, answered
with his usual brutality of manner.</p>

<p>“And what may you not be accused of, then?”
demanded Green, scarcely able to restrain himself
from flying like a tiger-cat at his master: “for
what have you not committed?”</p>

<p>“By heaven, Mr. Green, this shall last no longer!”
ejaculated Heathcote, starting from his seat: “you
are drunk, sir&mdash;you have been drinking, I tell you.
Come&mdash;be reasonable,” he continued, almost in a
coaxing tone: “go home quietly&mdash;and be here early
in the morning to make an apology for your present
bad conduct. I promise to forgive you.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me!” repeated Green:&mdash;“forgive me!”
he exclaimed again, with a chuckling laugh which
did Mr. Heathcote harm to hear it: “I have done
nothing, sir, that needs forgiveness&mdash;and if I was
to kick you thrice round this room where you have
tyrannised over me for twelve years, it would only
be paying back a minute portion of all I owe
you.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Green, you will provoke me to do something
desperate,” retorted Heathcote, in a low,
thick tone, as he approached his head clerk to read
in that individual’s countenance the solution of his
present enigmatical conduct: “you will provoke
me, I say&mdash;and then you will be sorry for your
rashness. Consider&mdash;reflect&mdash;in another month’s
time the thousand pounds must positively be forthcoming&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will you replace it for me?” demanded Green,
abruptly.</p>

<p>“You know what I have always said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and I now know likewise what you have
always <em>meant</em>,” interrupted Green, darting a look
full of malignant hate and savage spite at the lawyer.
“For twelve long years, sir, I have been your
slave&mdash;your vile and abject slave. I was a criminal,
it is true, when I first came to you&mdash;for I had committed
that forgery which you detected, and which
placed me in your power. But I had still the feelings
of a man&mdash;whereas you soon imbued me with
such ideas and reduced me to such a miserable state
of servitude, that I have wept bitter, bitter tears at
the thought of my own deep degradation. I could
have lied for you&mdash;I could have committed perjury
for you&mdash;I could have performed all the meannesses
and condescended to do all the vile and low trickery
which form part and parcel of your business:&mdash;but
when I found myself used as a mere tool and instrument
and treated like a spaniel, without ever
having a single kind word uttered to cheer me
beneath a yoke of crushing despotism&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You have had two guineas a week, paid with
scrupulous regularity,” interposed Heathcote, who,
from the tenour of the observations which Green
had just made, began to fancy that he was only
excited by liquor to make vague and general complaints,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
but that he was still as much in his power
as ever.</p>

<p>“Two guineas a-week!” repeated the man, indignantly:
“you are always dinning that fact in
my ears. But heaven knows that were my salary
six times as much, it would not repay me for all the
cruelty I have endured at your hands&mdash;nor for all
that one is obliged to <em>see</em> and <em>go through</em> while in
your employment. I had some tender feelings once:
but they have long ago been stifled by the horrible
spectacles of woe and misery which have been
forced upon my sight, and which have sprung from
your detestable covetousness. I have seen children
starving&mdash;mothers weeping over their dying babes&mdash;while
the fathers and husbands have been languishing
in gaol,&mdash;yes, in the debtor’s gaol where
you have thrown them, and where some of them
have died, cursing the name of James Heathcote!
Yes, sir&mdash;I have seen all this: and what is more&mdash;aye,
and worse, too&mdash;far worse&mdash;I have been an involuntary
instrument, as your clerk, in causing
much of that awful misery, the mere thought of
which almost drives me mad. Talk of the black
turpitude of murdering with a dagger or a pistol!&mdash;why,
it is a mercy to the slow&mdash;lingering&mdash;piece-meal
murders which you and men of your stamp
are constantly perpetrating. <em>For as true as there is
a God in heaven, there are more slow and cold-blooded
murders committed in one year by a certain class of
attorneys, than are recorded in the annals of Newgate
for a whole century!</em>”</p>

<p>Heathcote’s fears had all returned by rapid degrees
as his head clerk, turning full upon him,
levelled at his head the terrible charges summed up
in the preceding speech: but when these last words
fell upon his ear, he grew ghastly pale, and, staggering
back a few paces, sank into his chair,&mdash;<em>for
he knew how sternly true was the appalling accusation!</em></p>

<p>“Ah! well may your eyes glare upon me in
horror,” resumed Green: “but it is high time that
you should hear a few home truths&mdash;even though
they come from such lips as mine. For you doubtless
think that it is all very fine to issue a writ&mdash;refuse
delay&mdash;decline everything in the shape of
compromise&mdash;and then seize upon the goods of your
victim, or clap him into gaol:&mdash;but it is we who sit
in the outer office&mdash;we clerks, who can best penetrate
into the effects of such a heartless course.
When we see the door open, and the miserable
wretch come in with <em>care</em> as legibly written on his
countenance as if it were printed in letters on a
piece of paper,&mdash;and when he comes crawling up
to our desk, as if <em>his</em> utter self-abasement would be
so pleasing to us clerks as to induce us to say a
good word in his behalf to <em>you</em>,&mdash;then, when he asks
in a tone of anguish which is ready to burst forth
into a flood of tears, ‘<em>Do you think it likely that Mr.
Heathcote will give me time?</em>’&mdash;it is <em>then</em>, I say, that
the real feelings of such poor wretches transpire,
and the murderous effects of the harsh proceedings
adopted by lawyers of <em>your</em> stamp become painfully
apparent.”</p>

<p>“To what is all this to lead, Mr. Green?” demanded
Heathcote, in a low and subdued tone: for
it struck him that such a long address could only
be meant to herald some evil tidings, to which his
clerk, in the refinement of vindictive cruelty,
sought to impart a more vivid poignancy by prefatory
delays.</p>

<p>“To what is all this to lead?” repeated Green:
“why&mdash;to your utter confusion, black-hearted old
man that you are! Think of the conversation that
took place between us a few days ago: did I not
then tell you that there were many deaths to be laid
to your door? And I was right! You sent off
Thompson to prison&mdash;his wife and child perished,
and he cut his throat:&mdash;<em>you</em> are the murderer of
those three human beings! The man Beale, whom
you likewise threw into Whitecross Street, died in
the infirmary of that gaol&mdash;died of a broken heart,
sir;&mdash;and <em>you</em> were his murderer! Hundreds and
hundreds of deaths have you caused in the same
way,&mdash;<em>hundreds and hundreds of legal murders!</em>”</p>

<p>“Green&mdash;Mr. Green!” gasped the lawyer, writhing
as if he were a dwarf in the grasp of a giant: then,
wondering why he should thus put up with the insolence
of his clerk, and falling back upon the
belief that the man could not possibly conduct
himself in such a way unless he were under the
influence of liquor, he suddenly started from his
seat, exclaiming, “By heaven! sir, you have gone
so far that all hope of forgiveness on my part is impossible.”</p>

<p>“I care nothing for your pardon&mdash;and shall not
even condescend to solicit it,” replied Mr. Green,
in a tone of complete and unmistakeable defiance.
“I am going to leave you at once&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Leave me!” ejaculated Heathcote, who had
hitherto believed it to be impossible that his clerk
could throw off the chains of servitude and thraldom
which had been so firmly rivetted upon him:
“leave me!” he repeated: “yes&mdash;oh! yes,” he
added, his countenance assuming an expression of
the most diabolical sardonism;&mdash;“yes&mdash;you shall
indeed leave me&mdash;but it will be to change your
quarters for a cell in Newgate!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps <em>you</em> will be the first to repair thither,”
said Green, with a chuckle that seemed to grate
upon the lawyer’s ears like the sound emitted by
the process of sharpening the teeth of a saw.</p>

<p>“In less than two hours, Mr. Green, Clarence
Villiers shall be made acquainted with the fact
that the thousand pounds have long ceased to be in
the Bank of England,” exclaimed Heathcote.</p>

<p>“The thousand pounds are there, sir&mdash;yes, <em>there</em>
at this very minute,” answered Green, in a tone of
assurance which convinced Heathcote that the man
was speaking the truth. “And what is more, sir,
Mr. Villiers knows all&mdash;and has forgiven all! This
morning did I replace the money; this afternoon
did I repair to Brompton to throw myself at the
feet of Mr. Villiers&mdash;confess everything&mdash;and implore
his pardon. Oh! sir, he is a generous man&mdash;and
he forgave me. ‘<em>You have been guilty of a terrible
breach of trust&mdash;nay, a heinous crime, Mr. Green</em>,’
he said; ‘<em>but you have atoned for your turpitude. It
is our duty in this world to forgive where true contrition
is manifested; and I will take care to hold
you harmless in this case, should it ever transpire
that the money had been sold out.</em>’&mdash;I wept while I
thanked him; and I said, ‘<em>But I have a bitter enemy
who is acquainted with the whole transaction: what
can be done to save me from disgrace, should he inform
against me?</em>’&mdash;‘<em>He cannot prove that you forged
my name</em>,’ responded Villiers: ‘<em>I alone can prove
that; and under present circumstances, I would not
for worlds inflict an injury upon you.</em>’ I again
thanked him, and took my leave. You now perceive,
Mr. Heathcote, that so far from being in
<em>your</em> power, <em>you</em> are entirely in mine. The other
day you told me that you would crush me as if I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
were a worm&mdash;that you would send me to Newgate&mdash;that
you would abandon me to my fate&mdash;and
that you would even <em>help</em> to have me shipped for
eternal exile. I thank you for all your kind intentions,
sir,” added Green, in a tone of bitter satire;
“and I mean to show my gratitude by exposing you
and your villany to the utmost of my ability.”</p>

<p>“And what injury can <em>you</em> do me, reptile?” exclaimed
Heathcote, quivering with rage.</p>

<p>“What injury!” repeated Green: “I can ruin
you!” he added, speaking loudly and triumphantly.
“Oh! I am acquainted with far more of your dark
transactions and nefarious schemes than you can
possibly imagine. The deeds that are contained
therein,” he added, pointing to the japanned tin-boxes,
“are not sealed books to me. I have read
them all&mdash;yes, <em>all</em>&mdash;and have gleaned enough information
to enable me to bring upon you such a host
of ruined and defrauded clients, that you would
never dare to face them even for a moment. Ah!
you may turn pale as death&mdash;and your eyes may
glare with rage: but it is not the less true that I
hold you in my power. If you destroy those deeds,
you then annihilate the only documents which
prove your title to the vast property which you
have accumulated: if you do not destroy them,
you leave in existence the damning evidences
of your villany. At this very moment there are
old men and old women struggling on in the bitterest
penury, and cursing the life from which
they have not the moral courage to fly through the
medium of suicide,&mdash;some of them in the workhouse&mdash;others
dependent on the bounty of relatives;&mdash;and
all these have been plunged into this
appalling misery by <em>you</em>! But every step you took
to enmesh and ensnare them&mdash;every scheme you
devised to get them completely into your power,
so that you might wrench from them the last acre
of their lands and the last guinea of their fortunes,&mdash;all&mdash;all
has been illegal&mdash;fraudulent&mdash;extortionate&mdash;vile!
Oh! it will alone prove a fine
harvest for me, when I again take out my certificate
to practise as an attorney&mdash;which I am about
to do,&mdash;it will be a splendid commencement, I
say, to take up the causes of all those persons and
compel you to render an account to your ruined
clients. This, sir, is what I am about to do: and now
it shall be war between us&mdash;war to the very knife,&mdash;and
ere many months have elapsed, you will bitterly
repent your conduct to one who only asked
for a little kindness in return for his faithful&mdash;far
too faithful services.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, Mr. Green abruptly quitted
the office, leaving James Heathcote in a state of
mind not even to be envied by a criminal about to
ascend the steps of the scaffold.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CCII">CHAPTER CCII.<br />

<span class="medium">JACK RILY AND VITRIOL BOB.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Green had so well managed matters in
respect to the Bank-notes, that in the course of a
few hours he had contrived to obtain cash for
about twelve thousand pounds’ worth; and the
Doctor was so delighted at his success, that he had
testified his satisfaction by making him a present of
a couple of thousand for himself.</p>

<p>Being now a rich man, Mr. Rily resolved to quit
his lodgings in Roupel-street and take superior
apartments in a better neighbourhood. Then it
struck him, as he was walking leisurely along in
the City, after having parted from Green, that it
would be far more agreeable to become the possessor
of a nice little cottage in a pleasant suburb; and,
while this idea was uppermost in his mind, he happened
to observe in the window of a house-agent
an announcement to the effect that “several elegant
and desirable villas were to be let on lease or sold,
in the most delightful part of Pentonville.” The
Doctor entered the office, obtained a card to view
the premises thus advertised, and, taking a cab, proceeded
straight to the suburb indicated.</p>

<p>Having nothing particular to do, Jack Rily spent
several hours in inspecting the villas, and at length
fixed upon one which he resolved to purchase. The
individual who had built the houses on speculation,
and who was compelled to dispose of one on any
terms before he could possibly finish another, resided
close at hand; and a bargain being speedily
concluded, a particular hour on the following day
was agreed upon as the time for a final settlement.</p>

<p>Jack Rily, having proceeded thus far in his
arrangements, entered a public-house which had
lately been built on an eminence within a quarter of
a mile of the New Model Prison; and there he
ordered some dinner&mdash;for it was now four o’clock
in the afternoon. The repast over, he took a seat
at an open window which commanded a view of
Copenhagen Fields and all the neighbouring district;
and with his pipe and some hot brandy-and-water
he was enjoying himself to his heart’s content,
when he was suddenly startled by the
appearance of Vitriol Bob, who happened to pass
that way.</p>

<p>Though a brave, fearless, and desperate man, the
Doctor nevertheless uttered an ejaculation of mingled
surprise and annoyance; and his enemy, who
would not have otherwise perceived him, instantly
glanced towards the window. Their looks met&mdash;and
a diabolical scowl distorted the countenance of
Vitriol Bob,&mdash;while Jack Rily, immediately recovering
his presence of mind, surveyed the miscreant
with cool defiance.</p>

<p>Vitriol Bob appeared to hesitate for a moment
what course to pursue: then, suddenly making up
his mind, he entered the public-room where the
Doctor was seated.</p>

<p>Taking a chair at another table, he rang the bell
and ordered some spirits-and-water, in payment for
which he threw down a sovereign, receiving the
change.</p>

<p>When the waiter had disappeared, and the two
villains were alone together, Vitriol Bob looked
maliciously at Jack Rily, as much as to say, “You
see I am not without money;” and then he glanced
complacently at the new suit of black which he
had on.</p>

<p>For a change had taken place in Vitriol Bob’s
appearance; and he seemed to be “in high feather,”
as well as his enemy the Doctor. His huge black
whiskers had been trimmed, oiled, and curled&mdash;a
process that did not however materially mitigate
the hang-dog expression of his countenance: for
his small, reptile eyes still glared ferociously from
beneath his thick, overhanging brows,&mdash;his lips
were as usual of a livid hue,&mdash;and his broken nose
positively appeared more flat on his face than ever.</p>

<p>“Your health, Jack,” said the miscreant, nodding
with a kind of malignant familiarity, as he raised
the steaming glass to his lips.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

<p>“Thank’ee kindly, Bob,” returned the Doctor, in
a tone of mock civility.</p>

<p>“Now that we have met at last, old feller, we
won’t part again in a hurry,” observed Vitriol Bob
after a pause, during which he lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>“Just as you choose, my tulip,” said Rily, calmly
puffing away and contemplating the thin blueish
vapour which curled lazily from the bowl of his
pipe out of the window.</p>

<p>“You and I have a score to settle, you know,
Jack,” continued Vitriol Bob; “and it seems as if
the Devil had thrown us in each other’s way this
evenin’ on purpose to reggilate our accounts.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s the construction you put upon it,
eh?” said the Doctor. “Well&mdash;just as you like.”</p>

<p>“You know that you used me shameful in that
Stamford-street business t’other day,” proceeded
Vitriol Bob.</p>

<p>“It was only what you deserved for the trick you
played me, old fellow,” retorted the Doctor, but
with amazing coolness alike of tone and manner.</p>

<p>“I don’t deny that I bilked you out of a part of
your reglars in the matter alluded to,” said Bob:
“but it didn’t deserve such a return as you gived
me in the Haunted House. Thank God, I had my
revenge on the old o’oman t’other night.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;she’s disposed of,” observed Jack; “and I
can’t forgive you for it, Bob&mdash;even if you wished us
to be friends. She was a fine old creature,&mdash;and I
had an affection for her, because she was the ugliest
wretch I ever saw in the shape of a woman&mdash;and
her spirit was admirable.”</p>

<p>“I meant the blow for <em>you</em>, Jack,” said Vitriol
Bob: “but it’s just as well now that the bottle
broke over her, since you and me have met again.”</p>

<p>“Have you got another bottle in your pocket,
Bob?” demanded the Doctor: “because if we are
to have a tuzzle for it before we part, I may as well
put myself on as equal terms with you as possible.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t take no unfair advantage, Jack,” was
the reply: and, as the villain thus spoke, he slapped
his hands against the skirts of his coat his breeches’
pockets, and his breast, to convince his antagonist
that he had no bottle about his person.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing like fair play, Bob,” returned
the Doctor; “and therefore if you like to feel about
me to convince yourself that I have no fire-arms,
you’re welcome.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take your word for it, Jack,” responded
Vitriol Bob. “But I suppose you have got a clasp-knife.”</p>

<p>“I never go without one,” was the answer: “and
it’s as sharp as a razor.”</p>

<p>“So is mine,” observed the other miscreant; and
then there was a long pause, during which the two
men contemplated each other with a calmness and
serenity that would have prevented even the most
acute observer from noticing the malignant light
that gleamed in the depths of their eyes.</p>

<p>And while the one continued to puff his pipe in
a leisurely manner, the other smoked his cigar with
equal ease; so that they appeared to be two friends
enjoying themselves in a pleasant way in the cool
of the evening.</p>

<p>“I suppose I interrupted some sport t’other
night, Jack,” said Vitriol Bob, at length breaking
the silence. “You and the old o’oman wasn’t out
together at that hour for nothink&mdash;particklerly in
such a neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;we were going to do a little business
together,” observed the Doctor. “You first twigged
me in Sloane Street. I saw you!”</p>

<p>“I knowed you did: but you didn’t suspect that
I follered you.”</p>

<p>“Rather,” said Jack Rily. “At least, I thought
it very probable.”</p>

<p>“You’re aweer that the old o’oman’s dead, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“I said as much just now. ’Twas in the papers,”
remarked Jack Rily.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I read it in the <em>Adwertiser</em>,” responded
Vitriol Bob.</p>

<p>There was another pause, during which the two
miscreants had their glasses replenished. The
Doctor also refilled his pipe, and the other lighted
a second cigar.</p>

<p>“We’ll make ourselves comfortable, Jack,” said
Vitriol Bob, “as long as you like: and whenever
you feel disposed to go, mind that I shall be arter
you.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I can’t prevent <em>that</em>,” observed the Doctor,
coolly. “You’ve a right to walk which way
you choose in this free country.”</p>

<p>“Thank’ee for giving me the information,” said
Bob, in a satirical tone. “But of course I mean to
stick to you till you’re so wearied of my company
that you <em>must</em> come to a last struggle either to
shake me off altogether, or perish yourself. For,
mind, if I catch you asleep, Jack, I shall stick my
clasp-knife into you up to the haft.”</p>

<p>“I’m obliged to you for letting me know your
kind intentions beforehand,” observed the Doctor:
“because I shall adopt precisely the same mode of
warfare.”</p>

<p>“Now, then, we understand each other,” said
Vitriol Bob; “and that’s a comfort. But it’s a
great pity that two such fine fellers as you and
me should be at loggerheads. Howsomever, it
can’t be helped&mdash;and a reconcilement, or whatever
they call it, is impossible. Your life or mine,
Jack&mdash;that’s the question to be decided now.”</p>

<p>“Depend upon it, old fellow, that you’ll be a
croaker before morning,” returned the Doctor, as
he raised his glass to his lips.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it’s you that’ll be a stiff’un, my boy,” was
the pleasant retort.</p>

<p>“Time must show. Remember that it’s no infant
you’ll have to deal with.”</p>

<p>“I should have beat you that night in the Haunted
House, Jack, if the old o’oman hadn’t come to your
assistance,” observed Vitriol Bob, with a low but
diabolical chuckle.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but it was because I slipped over something,
old fellow,” was the answer; “and I shall
take care to keep more steady on my pins next
time.”</p>

<p>“Depend upon it that when the death-struggle
<em>does</em> come, Jack, the fust that slips will be the dead
’un. Did you ever hear of the Kentuckian fashion
of dealing with an enemy?” demanded Vitriol
Bob.</p>

<p>“Never,” was the reply. “But I dare say it’s
something damnable&mdash;as bad, perhaps, as breaking
a vitriol-bottle over a person’s face&mdash;or else you
wouldn’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Jack: it’s <em>gouging</em> that I
mean.”</p>

<p>“And what’s gouging, pray?”</p>

<p>“Tearing a fellow’s eye out of its socket,” answered
Vitriol Bob.</p>

<p>“One can play at that game as well as another,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
observed the Doctor, totally unmoved by the horrid
nature of the conversation.</p>

<p>“To be sure: and we shall sooner or later see
who beats at it.”</p>

<p>Another pause succeeded this last remark of
Vitriol Bob; and again did the two men sit contemplating
each his enemy with a composure that
was unnatural and dreadful to a degree under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>Time wore on in this manner: their glasses were
frequently replenished&mdash;and yet the liquor appeared
not to produce the least effect upon them; but,
cool, collected, and self-possessed, they sate measuring
each other’s form and calculating its strength,
until darkness insensibly stole upon them. The
waiter then entered to light the gas; and several
frequenters of the house began to drop in to take
their evening’s allowance of alcoholic drink and
stupifying tobacco.</p>

<p>At length Jack Rily rose, and, looking hard at
his enemy, said, “I am going <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p>“Wery well,” returned Vitriol Bob: “I’ll keep
you company.”</p>

<p>There was nothing in these observations to excite
either the curiosity or the suspicions of the other
persons in the public-house-parlour: nevertheless,
those words had a terrible significancy for the two
men who had exchanged them.</p>

<p>The Doctor walked leisurely out of the room first;
and Vitriol Bob followed him. But the instant
they were outside the premises, the former turned
abruptly round upon his enemy, saying, “Come, let
us proceed abreast: I don’t mean to give you
a chance of stabbing me from behind.”</p>

<p>“Just as you like,” observed Vitriol Bob; and he
placed himself at the Doctor’s right hand, leaving
an interval of about a couple of feet between them.</p>

<p>In this manner they walked on in silence,&mdash;each
occupied with his own peculiar reflections.</p>

<p>Vitriol Bob was intent only on vengeance,&mdash;dread,
full, complete, and diabolical vengeance; and,
though he seemed to be looking straight forward,
he was nevertheless watching his companion with
the sidelong glances of his reptile-like eyes.</p>

<p>Jack Rily was calculating in his mind what
course he should adopt. He was naturally as brave
as a lion: but he did not perceive any advantage in
risking his life in a struggle that, even were he victorious,
would produce neither profit nor glory.
The only possible good that could result to him
from a triumphant issue of the quarrel, would be
the removal of a bitter, inveterate, and determined
enemy. Nevertheless, the Doctor had most potent
reasons to induce him to avoid this deadly encounter.
He had just obtained a vast sum of money,
and had the means of realising five times as much:
the world, therefore, had suddenly assumed a smiling
aspect in his eyes. He had already resolved to
abandon his nefarious pursuits, which indeed were
no longer necessary&mdash;and settle down quietly in
the cottage for the purchase of which he had that day
concluded a bargain;&mdash;and all these prospects were
to be staked on the hazard of a die&mdash;risked fearfully
at the bidding of the miscreant who was walking
by his side!</p>

<p>At one moment the Doctor seriously thought of
giving his companion into charge to the first corps
of policemen whom they might encounter; for this
was the hour when the little detachments of constables
went about relieving their comrades on
duty. But that idea was abandoned almost as soon
as formed: inasmuch as Jack Rily had all his
money about him, and he knew that if he handed
Vitriol Bob over to the police as the murderer of
Torrens or of Mrs. Mortimer, the miscreant would
unhesitatingly turn round with some charge that
would at least place him (the Doctor) in temporary
restraint, and lead to an examination of his
person.</p>

<p>Jack Rily therefore came to the determination of
pushing on into the heart of London, well knowing
that Vitriol Bob’s object was not to assail him in
any neighbourhood where the contest was likely to
be observed and prevented, but to drive him by dint
of persecution, dogging, and a hateful companionship,
into the open country, where through very
desperation the Doctor should make up his mind
to settle the matter decisively by a struggle on
equal terms. Feeling convinced that this was his
enemy’s purpose, Jack Rily resolved either to weary
him out or give him the slip if possible&mdash;or else to
seize an opportunity of stabbing him suddenly in
some place where an immediate escape was practicable.</p>

<p>We must again observe it was through no cowardice
that the Doctor was desirous of avoiding a conflict
from which only one could possibly depart
alive: but he had so many inducements to cling to
existence, that he saw no advantage in risking them
all in a quarrel where the personal animosity was
entirely on the other side.</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour they arrived in the
vicinity of the Angel at Islington; and Jack Rily,
now breaking the silence which had lasted since
they quitted the public-house at Pentonville, said,
“This walking makes one thirsty: let’s have some
beer.”</p>

<p>“Willingly,” answered Vitriol Bob: “and we’ll
drink out of the same pot to make people believe
we’re friends.”</p>

<p>They accordingly entered a gin-shop and shared
a pot of porter at the bar; after which they resumed
their walk, passing down the City Road. They
kept abreast, and preserved a deep silence,&mdash;each
watching the movements of the other&mdash;the Doctor
in the hope of being able to give his companion a
sudden thrust with his knife&mdash;and Vitriol Bob for
the purpose of preventing the escape of his enemy.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock when they came within sight
of the Bank of England; and as they passed under
its solid wall, Jack Rily wondered whether he
should be alive to keep an appointment which he
had with Green for eleven next morning in order
to have some more of his notes changed by that
individual.</p>

<p>“All the money in that there place, old feller,
won’t save one or t’other of us from death before
many hours is gone by,” observed Vitriol Bob, in a
low and ferocious tone.</p>

<p>“You must make the best use of your time,
then,” returned Jack; “since you’ve got a presentiment
that it’s so near.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it’s you that had better say your prayers,”
retorted the miscreant. “But what’s the use of
keeping both your hands in your pockets? If you
think you’ll be able to draw out your knife suddenly
and give me a poke under the ribs, you’re
uncommonly mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t dreaming of such a thing,” answered
Jack Rily, for the first time showing a slight degree
of confusion in his manner.</p>

<p>“It’s false, old feller,” said Vitriol Bob: “you’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
got the clasp-knife open in your pocket&mdash;I know
you have. The gas-lights is strong enough about
there to enable a sharp-sighted chap, like me, to
twig all that goes on.”</p>

<p>“It’s you that speaks false,” returned Jack Rily,
still keeping his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>And, again relapsing into silence, they pursued
their way.</p>

<p>Passing in front of the Exchange, and up Cornhill,
they turned into Birchin Lane. There Jack
Rily hesitated for an instant which way to proceed:
but suddenly recollecting that in a little passage to
the left there was a public-house called the Bengal
Arms, he said, “There’s a crib here where they
sell capital ale.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have some,” cried Vitriol Bob. “You go
on fust&mdash;the place is too narrer for us both.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;you go first,” said the Doctor.</p>

<p>“In this way then,” responded Vitriol Bob: and
stepping nimbly in front of his companion, he
turned round and walked backwards along the passage
until it suddenly grew wider opposite the door
of the Bengal Arms.</p>

<p>Jack Rily laughed at this manœuvre: but he was
in reality disappointed&mdash;for had Vitriol Bob acted
with less precaution, he would have assuredly received
the whole length of the Doctor’s formidable
knife in his back, ere he had proceeded half way up
the passage.</p>

<p>“We’ll go into the parlour here,” said Jack, “and
have some bread and cheese. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” observed Vitriol Bob, in a dry, laconic
tone which denoted the terrible determination that
inspired the man’s mind,&mdash;a determination never to
part from his companion until one of them should
be no more!</p>

<p>There was something awful&mdash;something frightfully
revolting and hideously appalling in the circumstance
of those two miscreants thus wandering
about together in a manner that appeared amicable
enough to all who beheld them,&mdash;two wretches
possessing the hearts of fiends and the external
ugliness of monsters,&mdash;two incarnate demons capable
of any turpitude, however black the dye!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CCIII">CHAPTER CCIII.<br />

<span class="medium">THE BENGAL ARMS.&mdash;RENEWED WANDERINGS.</span></h2>

<p>The parlour at the Bengal Arms is&mdash;or at least
was at the time whereof we are writing&mdash;a long,
low, dingy room, very dark in the day-time and indifferently
lighted in the evening. It is always
filled with a motley assembly of guests; and ale is
the beverage most in request&mdash;while to one who indulges
in a cigar, at least ten patronise the unaffected
enjoyment of the clay-pipe.</p>

<p>On the present occasion the company was numerous:
the tobacco-smoke hung like a dense mist
in the place, the gas-burners showing dimly through
the pestiferous haze;&mdash;and the heat was intense.</p>

<p>Jack Rily and Vitriol Bob contrived to find room
at one of the tables; and a slip-shod waiter supplied
them in due time with a pot of ale and bread and
cheese, to the discussion of which they addressed
themselves in a manner affording not the slightest
suspicion of the deadly enmity which existed between
them.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged they had an opportunity
of listening to the conversation that was
taking place amongst the other guests.</p>

<p>“Well, for my part,” said a little, stout, podgy
individual, with a bald head and a round, red,
good-humoured countenance, “I have always been
taught to look on the City institootions as the
blessedest things ever inwented.”</p>

<p>“And I maintain that they’re the foulest abuses
in the universe,” exclaimed a tall, thin, sallow-faced
individual, striking the table with his clenched
fist as he spoke. “Why should everything east of
Temple Bar be different from everything west?” he
demanded, looking sternly round upon the company
as if to defy any one to answer his questions.
“Why should it be necessary to have barristers as
magistrates in Westminster, and fat stupid old Aldermen
in the City?&mdash;why should the ridiculous
ostentation, useless trappings, and preposterous
display of the Mayoralty be maintained for so miserably
small a fraction of the great metropolis? Talk
of your City Institutions, indeed!&mdash;they are either
the most awful nonsense that ever made grown up
persons look more absurd than little boys playing
with paper cocked-hats and wooden swords&mdash;or else
they are rottenness and corruption. When the
Municipal Corporations were reformed in 1835, why
was the City of London omitted! Did not Lord
John Russell then pledge himself <em>most solemnly and
sacredly</em> to bring in a separate bill for the London
Corporation?&mdash;and has this promise, almost amounting
to a vow, ever been fulfilled? No: and why?
Because every Government, one after another, is
afraid to lose the political support of this precious
Corporation. And to these selfish considerations is
sacrificed every principle of justice, propriety, and
common sense. Look at the rascally extravagance
and vile profusion which characterise the Corporation.
The parish of St. Marylebone, with its hundred
and forty thousand inhabitants, only expends
<em>a hundred and twenty-eight thousand pounds</em> for
those parochial purposes which cost the City, with
a population of ten thousand less than the other,
nearly <em>a million</em>! The difference is that Marylebone
is governed by an intelligent vestry&mdash;whereas
London is under a stupid Corporation! Look,
again, at the iniquities perpetrated by the Aldermen
in their capacity as licensing magistrates&mdash;the
gross partiality that they show towards some publicans,
and the inveterate hostility they manifest towards
others. The <em>rights of the freemen</em> are a scandal
and a shame&mdash;many able mechanics and other
operatives being frequently driven from the City on
account of their inability to pay the money for taking
up their freedom.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Then again, look at the
preposterous power which the Lord Mayor enjoys
of stopping up all the thoroughfares and impeding
business in every shape and way, on any occasion
when it may suit him and his bloated, guzzling,
purse-proud adherents to pass in their gingerbread
coaches through the City. Is this consistent with
British freedom?&mdash;is it compatible with the rights
or interests of the citizens? Faugh!”</p>

<p>And the speaker resumed his pipe, in deep disgust
at the abuses which he had thus succinctly,
but most truly enumerated.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know&mdash;but I like all our old institutions,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
said the bald-headed man, with the
stolid obstinacy and contemptible narrow-mindedness
which so frequently characterise the John
Bullism of a certain class. “The wisdom of our
ancestors&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The wisdom of the devil!” ejaculated the tall,
sallow-faced individual who had held forth on the
City abuses. “That is a fool’s reason for admiring
established and inveterate corruption. The wisdom
of our ancestors, indeed! Why&mdash;those ancestors
believed in the divine right of Kings, and were sincere
in praying on the 30th of January as if Charles
the First was really a Martyr instead of a Traitor.
Our ancestors, too, put faith in witches&mdash;aye, and
burnt them also! It was our ancestors who kindled
the fires in Smithfield where persons suffered at the
stake; and our ancestors advocated the most
blood-thirsty code of laws in Europe, in virtue of
which men were strung up by dozens at a time at
the Old Bailey. Our ancestors prosecuted writers
for their political and religious opinions, and seemed
to take a delight in everything that gratified the
inhuman ambition of Kings and Queens, to the
prejudice of real freedom. Our ancestors, in fact,
were the most ignorant&mdash;besotted&mdash;bloody-minded
miscreants that ever disgraced God’s earth; and
any man who turns an adoring glance upon the
deeds of those ruffians, deserves to be hooted out
of all decent society.”</p>

<p>Having thus delivered his sentiments on the subject,
the sallow-faced individual was about to resume
his pipe, when, another idea occurring to him,
he suddenly burst forth again in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“But who are those people that generalise so
inanely when they speak of the wisdom of our ancestors?
They are persons who inherit all the old,
wretched, and worn-out prejudices of their forefathers,
without having the intellect or the courage
to think for themselves. They are the statesmen
who gladly fall back upon any argument in order
to defend the monstrous abuses of our institutions
against the enlightening influence of reform. They
are the churchmen who are deeply interested in
preserving the loaves and fishes of which their ancestors
in the hierarchy plundered the nation.
They are, in fact, all those individuals who have
anything to lose by wholesome innovation, and
everything to gain by the maintenance of a system
so thoroughly rotten, corrupt, and loathsome that
it infects and demoralizes every grade of society.
The Peer eulogises the wisdom of his ancestors,
because they handed down to him usurped privileges
and an hereditary rank the principle of which
is a crying shame. The Member of the House of
Commons speaks of the wisdom of his ancestors,
because he holds his seat through the frightful corruption
introduced by them into the electoral system.
The placeman talks of the wisdom of his
ancestors, because they invented sinecures and distributed
with the lavish hand of robbers the gold
which they wrung from the marrow and the sinew
of the industrious millions. The parson praises the
wisdom of his ancestors, because they invented the
atrocious system of allowing a rector to enjoy five
thousand a-year for doing nothing, and paying his
curate ninety pounds a-year for doing everything.
The lawyer praises the wisdom of his ancestors,
because they devised such myriads of insane, stupid,
unjust, rascally, and contradictory enactments, that
a man cannot move hand or foot even in the most trivial
and common sense affairs, without the intervention
of an attorney: and wherever that common sense
does exist on one side, law is almost sure to be on
the other; in the same way that wherever justice
<em>is</em>, there law <em>is not</em>. For my part, I do firmly believe
that there is not a more wretched and oppressed
country in all the world than England&mdash;nor
a more duped, deceived, gulled, and humbugged
people on the face of the earth than the English.
Talk of freedom, indeed: why, almost every institution
you have is in favour of the rich and against
the poor!”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I see it,” observed the bald-pated
man, in the usually dogmatic tone of confirmed
obstinacy and unmitigated ignorance.</p>

<p>“Then you must be blind!” ejaculated the other,
his emphasis indicating sovereign contempt for the
individual whom he addressed. “Look at the Game
Laws: are they made for the rich or for the poor?
Are not thousands of miserable creatures thrown
into gaols for daring to kill a hare or a pheasant,
because, forsooth! it interferes with the sport of
the ‘squire? Do not the rich ride when out hunting
through the corn-fields of their tenants?&mdash;and
what redress can the latter obtain? Then, again,
look at the state of the law generally. What
chance has a poor man of bringing a wealthy
oppressor to justice?&mdash;who can go to Westminster
Hall without a pocket full of gold? Why, the
very Railway Companies make it a boast that by
means of capital they can ruin&mdash;aye, and break the
heart of any poor antagonist in a law-court, let his
cause be ever so just! Look, too, at the privileges
enjoyed by the landowners: what proportion of the
taxes do they bear in comparison with the industrious,
toiling, starving peasantry or mechanics on
those estates? Look at the condition of our taxation:
are not all the necessaries of life subjected to
frightful imposts, while the luxuries are comparatively
cheap to the favoured few who can obtain
them? What is the proportion between the duty
on a poor man’s horse and cart and a rich man’s
carriage and four?&mdash;what the proportion between
the poor man’s beer and spirits and the rich man’s
foreign wines? Again, if a scion of the aristocracy
wants money, he is provided with a good place if
not an absolute sinecure; whereas the poor man is
sent to die a lingering and degraded death in that
awful gaol denominated a work-house. Look at
the combination of capital against labour. If capitalists
and monopolists lower wages, there is no
redress save by means of <em>a strike</em> on the part of the
workmen; and <em>a strike</em> is looked upon as something
akin to rebellion against the Sovereign. In
every way is the law in favour of the rich&mdash;in every
way is it grinding and oppressive to the poor.”</p>

<p>A profound silence followed these observations:
for every one present, save the bald-pated man,
perceived their truth and recognized their justice,&mdash;and
even <em>he</em> had not impudence enough to venture
a denial which he could not sustain by argument.</p>

<p>“What we require, then,” resumed the sallow-faced
individual, at length breaking the long pause,
“is an entire reform,&mdash;a radical reform, and not a
measure bearing the name without any of the
reality. I love my country and my countrymen
as well as any British subject: but it makes
my heart bleed to witness the misery which
exists throughout the sphere of our industrious
population;&mdash;and it makes my blood boil to think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
that nothing is done to remedy the crying evils
and reform the tremendous abuses which I have
this night enumerated.”</p>

<div id="i_393" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_393.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The discourse was now taken up by several other
individuals present, the bald-headed gentleman declining
to pursue it farther; and the sallow-faced
guest fearlessly and ably dissected the whole social
and governmental system, concluding with an emphatic
declaration that the community should agitate
morally, but unweariedly, for those reforms which
were so much needed.</p>

<p>It was twelve o’clock when Jack Rily and Vitriol
Bob issued from the Bengal Arms; and passing
through George Yard, they entered Lombard Street.</p>

<p>Thence they proceeded towards London Bridge,
over which they walked in a leisurely manner&mdash;side
by side&mdash;watching each other&mdash;and maintaining a
profound silence.</p>

<p>Down the Blackfriars’ Road they went; and on
reaching the obelisk in St. George’s Fields, the Doctor
paused for a few minutes to make up his mind
what course to pursue.</p>

<p>He was already wearied&mdash;and a mental irritation
was growing upon him in spite of his characteristic
recklessness and indifference: he required rest&mdash;and
he knew that he could obtain none so long as
his terrible enemy was by his side.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may weary him out,” thought the
Doctor to himself: “or if I lead him into the open
country I shall perhaps be able to give him the slip.
Otherwise we must fight it out in some place where
no interruption need be dreaded.”</p>

<p>Influenced by these ideas, Jack Rily resumed his
wanderings, Vitriol Bob still remaining by his side
like the ghost of some murdered victim.</p>

<p>They proceeded towards the Elephant and Castle;
and on reaching that celebrated tavern, they once
more refreshed themselves with beer, as the establishment
was still open in consequence of some
parochial entertainment that was given there on
that particular evening.</p>

<p>On issuing from the house, the two men proceeded
along the Kent Road.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour had now elapsed since they had
last exchanged a word; for the feeling of desperate
irritation was growing stronger and stronger on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
the part of Jack Rily&mdash;while Vitriol Bob was becoming
impatient of this delay in the gratification
of his implacable vengeance.</p>

<p>But delight filled the soul of the latter when he
found that his companion was taking a direction
that led into the open country; and, breaking the
long silence which had prevailed, he said tauntingly,
“You are getting tired, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” replied the Doctor, assuming a cheerful
tone.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;you are, old feller,” exclaimed Vitriol
Bob: “you drag your feet along as if you was.”</p>

<p>“I could walk all night without being wearied so
much as you are now,” returned the Doctor: and,
thus speaking, he mended his pace.</p>

<p>“I never felt less tired than I am at present,
Jack,” said Vitriol Bob: “but you are failing in
spite of this pretended briskness. You can’t keep
it up.”</p>

<p>“You shall see,” answered the Doctor, his irritation
augmenting fearfully.</p>

<p>Vitriol Bob made no further observation upon the
subject; and the two miscreants walked on, side by
side, until they reached the Green Man at Blackheath.</p>

<p>There was no tavern&mdash;no beer-shop open; and
both were thirsty, alike with fatigue and the workings
of evil passions.</p>

<p>Seating himself upon a bench fixed against the
wall of a public-house, Jack Rily could not help
gnashing his teeth with rage; and as he maintained
his looks fixed upon the countenance of his enemy,
his eyes glared with a savage and ferocious malignity.
The moon-light enabled Vitriol Bob to catch
the full significancy of that expression which distorted
the Doctor’s features; and, sitting down
close by his side, he said, “You are growing desperate
now, Jack: I knowed I should disturb your
coolness and composure before long.”</p>

<p>“By God! you’re right, my man!” ejaculated the
Doctor, unable to restrain his irritation. “I had no
enmity against you at first&mdash;I would have shaken
hands with you and been as good friends as ever&mdash;aye,
and have given you more money than you’ve
ever yet seen in all your life,&mdash;given it to you as a
present! But now I hate and detest you&mdash;I loathe
and abhor you! Damnation! I could stick my
knife into you this very minute!”</p>

<p>“Two can play at that game,” returned Vitriol
Bob, savagely. “But remember that we’re talking
tolerably loud just underneath the windows of this
’ere public; and I don’t feel at all inclined to be
baulked of the satisfaction&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of a last and desperate struggle, eh?” exclaimed
the Doctor, starting up. “Well&mdash;we will not delay
it much longer. Come along:&mdash;it is pretty near
time that this child’s play was put an end to&mdash;I am
getting sick of it.”</p>

<p>“Bless ye, I’ve no such excitement,” said Vitriol
Bob, rising from the bench and again placing himself
by the side of his companion: “I rayther like it
than anythink else. We’ve had a nice walk&mdash;plenty
of refreshments&mdash;and now and then a cozie little bit
of chat&mdash;besides the advantage of hearing them
political sermons in at the Bengal Arms: and so I
don’t think you can say we’ve spent the time wery
disagreeably.”</p>

<p>All this was said to irritate the Doctor still more;
for Vitriol Bob, well acquainted with the disposition
of his enemy, knew that when once he was thus
excited it was impossible for him to regain his composure.</p>

<p>Jack Rily made no answer&mdash;but continued his
way in silence, weariness gaining upon his body as
rapidly as bitter ferocity was acquiring a more potent
influence over his mind.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CCIV">CHAPTER CCIV.<br />

<span class="medium">THE CATASTROPHE.</span></h2>

<p>It was two o’clock in the morning when the
Doctor and Vitriol Bob ascended Shooter’s Hill.</p>

<p>Both were much fatigued&mdash;but the former far
more so than the latter.</p>

<p>The moon rode high in the heavens, which were
spangled with thousands of stars; and every feature
of the scene was brought out into strong relief by
the pure silvery light that filled the air.</p>

<p>The countenance of Jack Rily was ghastly pale
and hideous to gaze upon&mdash;his large teeth gleaming
through the opening in his upper lip, and his eyes
glaring like those of a wild beast about to spring
upon its prey;&mdash;whereas the features of Vitriol Bob
denoted a stern&mdash;dogged&mdash;ferocious determination.</p>

<p>Having reached the top of the hill, the two men
paused as if by mutual though tacit consent; and
glancing rapidly along the road in each direction,
they neither saw nor heard anything that threatened
to interfere with the deadly purpose on which they
were now both intent.</p>

<p>No sound of vehicles met their ears&mdash;no human
forms dotted the long highway which, with its
white dust, had the appearance of a river traversing
the dark plains.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;are you pretty nearly tired out, Jack?”
demanded Vitriol Bob.</p>

<p>“I am as fresh as ever,” answered the Doctor.</p>

<p>“But you’re afraid, old feller,” exclaimed the
other.</p>

<p>“Not afraid of <em>you</em>!” retorted Jack Rily, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“You would have run away if you could,” said
his enemy.</p>

<p>“You are a liar, Bob,” was the savage response.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it’s you that tells the lie, Jack. I’ve
watched you narrerly&mdash;and I could see all that was
a-passing in your mind as plain as if it was a book.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t read a book, Bob, when you have
it open before you.”</p>

<p>“There you’re wrong, Doctor: I’ve had my hedication
as well as you.”</p>

<p>“And a pretty use you’ve made of it! But I
don’t see any use in our standing palavering here:
I want to get back to London&mdash;and so the sooner
you let me polish you off, the better.”</p>

<p>“I’m as anxious to come to the scratch as you.
Where shall it be?”</p>

<p>“In the field close by, Bob. We may be interrupted
in the road.”</p>

<p>“And yet there’s nothink and no one to be seen.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. We’ll make as sure as possible,”
observed the Doctor, who throughout this rapid and
laconic colloquy had endeavoured to appear as
collected and as composed as possible: but his
words had hissed through his teeth&mdash;for his mouth
was as parched as if he had been swallowing the
dry dust of the road.</p>

<p>“Let’s over the hedge, then,” said Vitriol Bob.</p>

<p>The two men accordingly made their way into the
adjoining field; and having proceeded to a short
distance down the sloping meadow, they suddenly
stopped short and confronted each other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span></p>

<p>“Shall it be here?” demanded Vitriol Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Jack Rily; and drawing his
clasp-knife, which was already open, from his
pocket, he sprang with a savage howl upon his
enemy.</p>

<p>But Vitriol Bob was also prepared with his sharp
weapon; and catching the Doctor’s right arm with
his left hand, he inflicted a wound upon the shoulder
upon his foe. Then the two men closed completely
upon each other&mdash;and the death-struggle
commenced!</p>

<p>It was an appalling spectacle,&mdash;the knives flashing
in the pure moon-light&mdash;and the eyes of the
miscreants glaring savagely, while they writhed in
each other’s embrace, savage howls bursting from
them at short intervals.</p>

<p>In less than a minute they were covered with
blood: but the nature of the contest only permitted
them to inflict hideous gashes and not decisive
wounds upon each other. But suddenly Jack Rily’s
foot slipped, and he fell backward&mdash;bringing however
his adversary down upon him: for the left hand
of each held a firm grasp upon the collar of the
other.</p>

<p>As they thus tumbled, Vitriol Bob endeavoured
to plant his knife in the breast of his antagonist&mdash;but
the spring of the weapon broke, and the blade
suddenly closing as it glanced over the Doctor’s
shoulder, cut through its owner’s fingers to the very
bone. A yell of mingled rage and pain escaped him;
but the chances were at the same moment equalised
by the fact of Rily’s clasp-knife escaping from his
hand.</p>

<p>The death-struggle was now continued by mere
brute force; and the Doctor succeeded in getting
uppermost. At the same time he seized upon Vitriol
Bob’s nose with his large sharp teeth and bit
it completely off&mdash;in spite of the almost superhuman
efforts of the other to resist this savage
attack.</p>

<p>Yelling horribly with the pain, and with his
countenance bathed in blood, Vitriol Bob once more
got his foe beneath him; and the Doctor echoed
those appalling cries of agony as he felt the fore-finger
of his adversary’s left hand thrust into one
of his eyes. Frightful&mdash;terrific&mdash;revolting was the
contest at this crisis,&mdash;the two miscreants writhing,
struggling, convulsing like snakes in each other’s
grasp,&mdash;and the ferocious process of gouging inflicting
the agonies of hell upon the maddened Jack
Rily.</p>

<p>’Twas done: the eye was literally torn out of its
socket; but the pain excited the Doctor to the most
tremendous efforts in order to wreak a deadly vengeance
upon his foe. And as they rolled over on
the blood-stained sward, Rily’s hand came in contact
with the knife which he had ere now lost; and
clutching it with a savage yell of triumph, he
plunged it into Vitriol Bob’s throat.</p>

<p>The miscreant, mortally wounded, rolled over on
the grass with a gurgling sound coming from
between his lips; and Jack Rily was immediately
upon him, brandishing the fatal weapon.</p>

<p>Then, at that moment, as the moon-light fell
fully upon the countenance of Vitriol Bob, as he
gazed up at his victorious enemy, what fiendish
hate&mdash;what impotent rage&mdash;what diabolical malignity
were depicted upon those distorted features
and expressed in every lineament of that blood-smeared
face,&mdash;a face rendered the more frightful
by the loss of the nose.</p>

<p>“Who will return to London this morning, Bob?”
demanded Jack Rily, scarcely able to articulate, so
parched was his throat&mdash;so agonising was the pain
in the socket whence the eye had been torn out.
“Ah! you can’t answer&mdash;but you know well
enough what the reply should be!”</p>

<p>Vitriol Bob made a sudden and desperate effort
to throw his enemy off him: but he was easily overpowered&mdash;and
in another moment the Doctor drove
the sharp blade of the knife through the man’s right
eye, deep into the brain.</p>

<p>So strong was the convulsive spasm which shot
through the form of Vitriol Bob, that the Doctor
was hurled completely off him: but all danger of a
renewal of the contest was past&mdash;Jack Rily’s enemy
was no more!</p>

<p>The conqueror lay for some minutes upon the
sward, so exhausted that it almost seemed possible
to give up the ghost at a gasp: it appeared, in fact,
as if he retained a spark of life within himself by
his own free will&mdash;but that were he to breathe even
too hard, existence would become extinct that
moment.</p>

<p>A sensation of numbness came over him, deadening
the pain which his eyeless socket occasioned
him; and for nearly ten minutes a sort of dreamy
repose stole upon the man, the incidents of the
night becoming confused and all his ideas jumbling
together pell-mell.</p>

<p>But suddenly&mdash;swift as the lightning darts forth
from the thunder-cloud upon the obscurity of a
stormy sky&mdash;a feeling of all that had happened and
where he was sprang up in the Doctor’s soul; and
half rising from his recumbent posture, he gazed
wildly around with the visual organ that was still
left.</p>

<p>The motionless corpse of his slaughtered enemy
lay near;&mdash;and the moon-light rendered the ghastly
countenance fearfully visible.</p>

<p>The pain in the socket now returned with renewed
force; and the Doctor, raising himself up
with difficulty, began to drag his heavy limbs slowly
away from the scene of a horrible contest and a
dreadful death.</p>

<p>He was wounded in many places; and the anguish
which he now again endured through the loss of
his eye, was maddening him.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the field there was a pond;
and Jack Rily, on reaching the bank of the stagnant
pool, felt that he could at that moment give all the
money he possessed for a single glass of pure water.
A draught from that pond would be delicious: but
how was he to obtain it? He might stoop down,
and endeavour to raise it with his hand&mdash;or he
might even fill his hat: but the bank was steep all
round&mdash;and the wretched man was so exhausted
and enfeebled that he knew he should fall in and
most likely be suffocated.</p>

<p>Seating himself upon the bank, he maintained
his one eye fixed upon the pond in which the moonbeams
were reflected; and at the expiration of a
few minutes he resolved to make an attempt to
assuage his burning thirst, even though the consequences
should be fatal.</p>

<p>Stooping cautiously down, he succeeded in filling
his hat; but as he was drawing it up, he overbalanced
himself, and fell headlong into the water.</p>

<p>The pond was deep: but Jack Rily managed to
drag himself out;&mdash;and on gaining the bank he
fainted.</p>

<p>How long he remained in a senseless state, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
knew not: or whether a deep sleep had succeeded
the fit, he was likewise unable to conjecture. Certain
it was, however, that on awaking slowly
from what appeared to have been a profound
trance, a stronger light than that which he had
last seen fell upon his view&mdash;for the sun had just
risen.</p>

<p>Then all the horrors of the past night came back
to the wretch’s memory; and, though the pain in
his eyeless socket was much mitigated, it was still
poignant enough to wring bitter imprecations
from his lips.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to rise: but he was as stiff all
over as if he had been beaten soundly with a thick
stick wielded by a strong hand&mdash;and he was also
weakened by loss of blood and the fatigues which
he had undergone.</p>

<p>He longed to get back to London, not only in
order to have surgical assistance to assuage the
pain consequent on the frightful injury he had sustained
by the loss of his eye; but also because he
was fearful that the body of his murdered enemy
would be shortly discovered and his own arrest
follow as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Therefore, although he would have given worlds
to be enabled to lie on the grass for hours longer,
he raised himself up, and moved slowly away
across the fields.</p>

<p>But how could he enter London in the broad
day-light&mdash;covered with blood and maimed as he
was? One course only appeared open to him:
namely, to remain concealed somewhere until night,
and then return to his lodgings. Accordingly, he
lay down under a hedge at the distance of about a
mile from the scene of the previous night’s deadly
contest; and again did he sink into a deep trance.</p>

<p>From this he was awakened by the sounds of
voices; and starting up, he heard people talking
on the other side of the hedge. They were
labourers&mdash;and having discovered the corpse of
Vitriol Bob in the field adjoining Shooter’s Hill,
they were hurrying back to the farm to which they
belonged, in order to give an alarm. Their pace
was rapid&mdash;their remarks denoted indescribable
horror&mdash;and Jack Rily remained a breathless listener
until they were out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>He then rose and moved off across the fields as
quickly as he could drag himself along.</p>

<p>The sun was now high in the heavens; and he
thereby knew that it was nearly mid-day. Not a
breath of wind stirred the air; and the heat was
stifling.</p>

<p>He had bandaged his head in such a way with his
handkerchief as to conceal the frightful injury
which he had received by the loss of his eye: but
the pain he experienced was excruciating.</p>

<p>In a short time he reached a rivulet, where he
washed himself; and he was likewise enabled to
slake his thirst. A turnip plucked from a field afforded
him a sorry meal;&mdash;and thus was a man
having thousands of pounds secured about his person,
reduced to the most miserable shifts and
compelled to wander about in the most deplorable
condition that it is possible to conceive.</p>

<p>Never had the time appeared to pass with such
leaden wings;&mdash;and, oh! how the man longed for
night to fall. Not more ardently did Wellington
at Waterloo crave for the coming of the obscurity
of evening, when, beaten and hopeless, he was in full
retreat ere the Prussians made their appearance to
change the fortune of the day and win the victory
which England so arrogantly claims, not more
earnestly did the Iron Duke desire the presence of
the darkness on that occasion, than Jack Rily in
the present instance.</p>

<p>At last the sun was sinking in the western horizon;
and the Doctor bent his steps towards the
metropolis which lay at a distance of about seven
miles.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock in the evening, when Jack
Rily entered the southern suburbs; and he succeeded
in gaining his lodgings in Roupel Street
without attracting any particular observation. A
surgeon with whom he was acquainted, and who did
not ask any questions so long as he was well paid,
dressed his wounds: and the Doctor began to think
the victory over his mortal enemy cheaply bought
by the loss of an eye. The black patch which he
was compelled to wear, certainly increased the hideousness
of his countenance: but as vanity was
not one of his failings, this circumstance did not so
much trouble him as the inconvenience and the pain
attendant upon the loss of the optic.</p>

<p>In the course of the ensuing day, the report
spread all over London that the body of a man,
frightfully mutilated, had been discovered in a field
near Shooter’s Hill; and that it had been removed
to a public-house at Blackheath, in order to lie
there for recognition. A minute description of
the clothing which the corpse had on, was given in
the newspapers and also in placards posted in the
principal thoroughfares of the metropolis; and it
was likewise stated that the clasp-knife, with which
the mortal blow was struck, had been left by the
murderer sticking in the victim’s head.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Mary Calvert&mdash;<em>alias</em> Pig-faced
Moll&mdash;and whom the reader will recollect to
have been already represented as Vitriol Bob’s paramour,
was alarmed by the protracted absence of
her fancy-man; and while wandering about in
search of him at his usual haunts, she observed
one of the placards.</p>

<p>The attire therein specified exactly corresponded
with the dress which Vitriol Bob wore when he
quitted her two days previously; and she at once
went to the public-house where the body was lying.
A glance was sufficient to convince her that her
suspicions were well founded; and on examining
the clasp-knife, she instantly recognised it as one
which she had frequently seen in the possession of
Jack Rily.</p>

<p>Everything was now clearly apparent to Molly
Calvert. She knew the deadly animosity that
Vitriol Bob had nourished against the Doctor: she
was likewise acquainted with the intention of her
paramour to wreak his vengeance upon that individual
on the first suitable occasion;&mdash;and she
therefore concluded that a deadly conflict had
taken place between them, ending in the murder of
her fancy-man.</p>

<p>From the public-house where the body lay, she
proceeded straight to a police-station, where she
gave such information as led to an immediate search
after the Doctor. In the course of the next day a
member of the Detectives ascertained that Jack
Rily had recently been living in Roupel Street,
and that he had only quitted his lodgings there the
preceding evening. For the Doctor, alarmed by the
publicity given to the discovery of Vitriol Bob’s
body, had deemed it prudent to flit.</p>

<p>Several days elapsed without affording the police
any clue to his whereabouts: but at the expiration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
of a week Molly Calvert herself one evening traced
him to an obscure pot-house in one of the vilest
parts of Bethnal Green; and he was immediately
arrested.</p>

<p>Upon his person was found a vast sum in gold
and bank-notes&mdash;but chiefly consisting of the latter;
and this amount was accordingly seized by the
officers. Jack Rily was then locked up for the
night, and on the following morning he was
taken before a magistrate.</p>

<p>When charged with the murder of Vitriol Bob,
he at once admitted that he had been the cause of
that individual’s death, but declared that it was in
self-defence. His story was corroborated by many
circumstances, amongst which the loss of his eye
was not the least; for the organ had been found, as
it was torn out of its socket, close by the corpse.
The gashes which the man had received&mdash;Vitriol
Bob’s own clasp-knife, discovered on the fatal spot&mdash;and
the evident marks of a fearful struggle
having taken place,&mdash;all proved that the deed was
neither cold-blooded nor accomplished by surprise.
On the other hand, might not Jack Rily have himself
provoked the contest which terminated so
fatally to his opponent? This point the magistrate
left to a jury to decide; and the Doctor was ordered
to be committed for trial. Relative to the money
found upon his person, he persisted in declaring
that it was his own, and that he had come by it
honestly,&mdash;but from what source he refused to
state.</p>

<span class="medium">THE CASTELCICALAN REPUBLIC.</span></h2>

<p>Castelcicala became a Republic; and Richard
Markham had the immortal honour of founding a
purely democratic government in the finest State
belonging to the Italian Peninsula.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Senators voted by an immense
majority the very measure which deprived them of
their rank of Peers, and abolished titles of nobility
altogether. This species of suicidal process, adopted
in obedience to the popular will, the interests of
the community at large, and the dictates of a consummate
civilisation, presented a glorious spectacle
to the eyes of all the world. And these good men
who thus sacrificed their own family interests to
those of their country, experienced a rich reward in
the enthusiasm with which they were received by
the people when the result of the division on the
third reading of the Bill was made known. For no
empty honours could outvie that applause which
grateful myriads thus poured forth; and if Dukes,
Marquises, Counts, Viscounts, and Barons went
home that day denuded of those titles, they had the
proud recompense of a conviction that their names
would shine all the more resplendently in history
through their own unartificial light. Their’s was
now the aristocracy of <small>VIRTUE</small> and <small>INTELLIGENCE</small>!</p>

<p>The Chamber of Peers was abolished; but all
those who had voted in favour of the Government
measures were returned by a grateful people as
members of the National Assembly which was now
convoked&mdash;the new system admitting of only one
House of Parliament. The moment that august
body met, one of its earliest duties was to frame
the new Constitution; and this was done on the
broadest and most liberal principles. It was resolved,
amongst other matters thus definitively
settled, that the President of the Republic should
be elected on the principle of universal suffrage,
and for three years; and we need scarcely inform
our readers that there was not even any opposition
attempted against General Markham.</p>

<p>But in the meantime&mdash;for these proceedings occupied
upwards of two months&mdash;the other Italian
States had become seriously alarmed at the establishment
of Democracy in Castelcicala; and the
diplomatic agents of Naples, Rome, Tuscany, and
Sardinia were ordered by their respective Governments
to demand their passports. These were instantaneously
granted; and shortly after the departure
of the envoys, a league was formed by the
Sovereigns of the States which we have named for
the purpose of compelling Castelcicala to return
into the sisterhood of monarchical countries. Protocols
first poured into the Foreign Office at Montoni;
and these were logically answered by the
Minister presiding over that department. Menaces
followed;&mdash;and these were treated with a firmness
proving how confidently General Markham and his
Cabinet relied upon the Castelcicalans to defend
the institutions which they had consecrated. An
ultimatum, threatening immediate hostilities, was
now signed by that blood-thirsty miscreant the
King of Naples&mdash;by the weak, timid, and vacillating
Pope Pius IX.&mdash;by the Grand Duke of Tuscany&mdash;and
by Charles Albert, King of Sardinia. To this
document Richard Markham replied, through the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, insisting upon the right
of the Castelcicalans, as a free people, to choose
their own form of Government; and the argument
was so well sustained by a mass of reasoning, that
the King of Sardinia and the Grand-Duke of Tuscany
withdrew from the league, re-accrediting their
diplomatic agents to the Castelcicalan Republic.
The timid Pope was frightened by a knowledge of
Markham’s military prowess into a similar course;
and the tyrant Ferdinand of Naples was left alone
in hostility against the newly-established Democracy.</p>

<p>This monarch&mdash;obstinate, self-willed, and blood-thirsty,
like all the Bourbons&mdash;was not disheartened
by what he called the “defection” of the Pontiff,
the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the King of Piedmont;
but he immediately declared war against the
Castelcicalan Republic. Thereupon General Markham
commenced the most active preparations, not
only to prevent an invasion, but to carry hostilities
into the enemy’s country. In a short time an army
of twenty-six thousand men was collected in the
south of the State; and Richard, having taken
leave of his family, proceeded to join it, attended by
a numerous staff, of which Charles Hatfield was a
member. The executive power was in the meantime
delegated to Signor Bassano, the General’s
brother-in-law; and the utmost enthusiasm pervaded
the entire Castelcicalan population, so great
was the confidence entertained in the valour of the
army and the skill of its commander.</p>

<p>It was in the first week of December, 1846, that
the Castelcicalan forces commenced their march
towards the Neapolitan frontier. Intelligence had
already arrived to the effect that the Neapolitans,
to the number of forty thousand men, were advancing
under the command of General Avellino;
but Markham, well knowing that the spirit of a
republican army was far greater than that which
animates troops belonging to a monarchy, was not
daunted by this immense numerical superiority on
the part of the enemy. He was deeply impressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
with the opinion that Napoleon Bonaparte had
damped the ardour of his soldiers by exchanging the
consular cap for the imperial crown: his knowledge
of French history told him that Bonaparte’s grandest
victories were gained with a republican army;&mdash;and
he was likewise well aware that the Neapolitan
troops loathed and abhorred the monarch who had
sent them out to fight against liberal institutions.
He therefore resolved to push on and meet the
enemy; for his generous nature contemplated with
horror the prospect of an invasion of the fertile
plains of Castelcicala by an army which even in its
own country acted the lawless and ferocious part of
a horde of plunderers and ravagers.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December, General Markham entered
the Neapolitan territory at the head of his
troops; and on the same evening he encamped beneath
the walls of Casino, which surrendered without
the least attempt at resistance. Here he waited
four days in the hope that the Neapolitans would
advance to the attack: but hearing that they had
halted to rest awhile at Sabino&mdash;a place about sixty
miles distant&mdash;he determined to continue his march.
Accordingly, in the afternoon of the 13th, he came
within sight of General Avellino’s army, which he
found to be occupying a strong position at a short
distance from Sabino.</p>

<p>General Markham ascended an elevated flat to
reconnoitre the precise distribution of the Neapolitans,
and he was speedily convinced that an immense
advantage might be gained by placing the
artillery upon that height. The task was a difficult
one to accomplish: but nothing was impossible to
an active commander and enthusiastic troops;&mdash;and
thus in a few hours, hollows were filled up, projections
levelled, and a pathway cleared for the ascent
of the cannon. Meantime General Avellino had
made no movement on his side; and ere sunset the
work of establishing the artillery on the eminence
was complete.</p>

<p>The inactivity of the enemy during the entire
afternoon led Markham to believe that Avellino
meditated an attack in the course of the night; and
the Castelcicalans were therefore fully prepared to
give the Neapolitans a warm reception. But hour
after hour passed without any indication of the approach
of the enemy; and General Markham resolved
to take the initiative at day-break.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the sun risen on the morning of the
14th of December, when the action commenced by a
smart fire on the part of the Castelcicalan light
troops, commanded by an active and gallant officer
in whom the General had full confidence. The
Neapolitans were thereby dislodged from an apparently
inaccessible position near Sabino; and the
result was that the Castelcicalans were enabled to
stretch out upon the plains so as to threaten the
enemy’s flanks. Both armies were soon within
cannon shot; and by nine o’clock in the forenoon
the action became general.</p>

<p>The manœuvres on the Castelcicalan side were
performed with a marvellous precision, fully compensating
for the numerical inferiority of Markham’s
troops; and by mid-day they had succeeded
in gaining possession of a wood which covered one
of the enemy’s corps. At the same time the cannon
upon the height were scattering death throughout
the Neapolitan ranks; and General Avellino ordered
up his reserve of cavalry to take a share in the conflict.
Markham was well prepared for this proceeding;
and at the head of his cuirassiers he dashed
against the new-comers. This charge was made
with an impetuosity altogether irresistible; and the
Neapolitans were thrown into disorder in that part
of the field. The Castelcicalans pursued their advantage;
and by four o’clock in the afternoon the
enemy were completely overwhelmed.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan loss was immense: upwards of
twelve thousand men of that army lay dead upon
the field&mdash;while an equal number had been made
prisoners. On Markham’s side the number of killed
did not exceed two thousand; but the generous-hearted
young man considered his splendid victory
to be dearly bought even by means of that sacrifice&mdash;and
the eyes which flashed with the fires of
heroism on the battle-field, now melted into tears
at the evidences of the sanguinary fight.</p>

<p>We should observe that the conduct of Charles
Hatfield was admirable throughout this memorable
day. In the charge upon the Neapolitan cavalry,
he comported himself in a manner that more than
once gained for him the approval of his commander;
and when the strife was over and the victory was
won, Markham complimented him on his prowess
in the presence of the officers gathered about him at
the time.</p>

<p>The booty acquired by this great battle was immense;
for the Neapolitans who survived the conflict
were compelled to retreat with such precipitation
as to leave all their baggage and artillery in the
hands of their enemy.</p>

<p>On the following day Markham set his army in
motion towards the capital, at the gates of which he
was determined to force the King to acknowledge
the Castelcicalan Republic. But in his progress
through the Neapolitan dominions, he adopted the
most rigorous measures to protect the innocent inhabitants
from plunder or wrong at the hands of
his victorious troops; and he issued a proclamation
to the effect that any soldier found guilty of an act
of oppression or outrage, should be expelled the
army and deprived of his civil rights as a Castelcicalan
citizen.</p>

<p>It was at about mid-day on the 17th of December
that Markham came within sight of Naples; and
he was then met by plenipotentiaries sent by King
Ferdinand to treat for an armistice, preparatory
to negociations for peace. The victorious General
received the deputies with the utmost courtesy; he
however bade them observe that it was not for him
to <em>treat</em>&mdash;but to <em>dictate</em>. Thereupon he drew up
the conditions on which he would spare the capital
and retire from the kingdom,&mdash;those terms being
the acknowledgment of the Castelcicalan Republic,
the payment of all the expenses incurred by Castelcicala
in consequence of this war, and a guarantee
against the renewal of hostilities on the same pretence.</p>

<p>To these conditions Ferdinand refused to accede;
and the citizens of Naples were called upon to arm
in defence of the capital. But the people rose up
as one man within the walls of the city, and
threatened to dethrone the King unless he accepted
the terms set forth by General Markham. The
blood-thirsty Ferdinand was accordingly compelled
to submit to the demands of the Castelcicalan
General; and the conditions being fulfilled in the
course of a few days, Markham began to retrace
his way to the State which he had thus a second
time saved from destruction.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the enthusiasm
with which the victorious General and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
army were received on their return to Castelcicala.
The roads were lined with a grateful population,
anxious to catch a glimpse of the hero and to testify
their joy at the conquest which he had achieved
over the enemy. Triumphal arches were raised&mdash;flags
were waving in all directions&mdash;towns were
illuminated&mdash;municipal corporations appeared with
congratulatory addresses&mdash;and the peasantry made
bonfires on the hills as proofs of their delight.</p>

<p>When the army approached Montoni, the General’s
family came out to meet him: and Isabella experienced
more sincere pride in embracing a husband
whose citizen name it was an honour to bear, than
if he still wore a princely title and held a sovereign
rank.</p>

<p>Peace was thus ensured to Castelcicala; and the
Republic was firmly established, not only by the
will of the people, but likewise by the prowess of
the army.</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield, who, as one of the General’s
aides-de-camp, already held the rank of lieutenant,
was now invested with a captaincy; and one of the
members of the National Assembly happening to
die at the time, the constituency thus left temporarily
unrepresented, offered to elect him as their
deputy. But he felt anxious to return to England;
for letters reached him about this period, informing
him that Mr. Hatfield’s health had latterly caused
serious apprehensions to his relatives and friends;&mdash;and
the young man accordingly demanded leave of
absence for a period. This was granted without
hesitation; and Charles Hatfield took his departure,
laden with presents from Markham and his family,
and attended with their sincerest wishes for his
prosperity.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CCVI">CHAPTER CCVI.<br />

<span class="medium">CHARLES HATFIELD IN LONDON AGAIN.</span></h2>

<p>The information which Charles Hatfield had
received respecting his father’s health, was too true.
Indeed, the accounts were purposely mitigated in
order to alarm him as little as possible; and on his
arrival at Lord Ellingham’s mansion in Pall Mall,
he found Mr. Hatfield confined to his bed.</p>

<p>Charles was greatly shocked at this circumstance:
for he could not help fancying that his conduct
had contributed mainly to undermine his father’s
health; but Mr. Hatfield reassured him on that
head by declaring that a severe cold was the commencement
of his illness.</p>

<p>“Were I thrown upon this bed of sickness by any
fault of yours, Charles,” he said, pressing his son’s
hand affectionately in both his own, “your behaviour
during your short sojourn in Italy would
speedily raise me from it. Not only have the newspapers
mentioned your name in a manner highly
creditable to you: but General Markham has sent
us accounts of the most satisfactory nature concerning
you.”</p>

<p>These words were gratifying indeed to the young
man.</p>

<p>“I can assure you, my revered parent,” he said,
“that I am indeed fully and completely changed.
The image of that vile woman whom we will not
name, is loathsome and abhorrent to me&mdash;and I
would as readily come in contact with a serpent, as
meet her again. Respecting that insane ambition
which animated me at the same time I formed
that disastrous attachment,&mdash;an ambition which
prompted me to aspire to a noble title,&mdash;it has all
vanished as if it had never been. I have contemplated
Republican institutions&mdash;I have seen a
mighty Prince and all his family lay aside their
high rank without regret and abandon their titles
with cheerfulness and at their own free will,&mdash;I
have likewise beheld the magnates of the land following
the same example, so that the equality of
citizenship may be fully established;&mdash;and I am
now astonished that I could ever have aspired
to mere titular distinction. My eyes have been
opened to the fact that men may be great and rise
to fame, without those adventitious aids which savour
of feudal barbarism;&mdash;and I am prouder of
that rank of <em>Captain</em> which the battle of Sabino
gave me in the army of Republican Castelcicala,
than I could possibly be were the coronet of Ellingham
placed upon my brow. Oh! how happy should I
feel, could we all proceed to Castelcicala and settle
for life in that beautiful city of Montoni which I
love so well: yes&mdash;all of us to fix our habitation
there,” continued Charles, with the enthusiasm
that was characteristic of his nature,&mdash;“you&mdash;my
dear mother, who received me so kindly&mdash;the excellent
Earl and his amiable Countess&mdash;myself&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what is to become of poor Lady Frances?”
asked Mr. Hatfield, with a smile in spite of his
severe indisposition. “Wherefore is she not included
in your list? Do you think that the Earl
and the Countess would leave their amiable and
lovely daughter behind them?”</p>

<p>Charles Hatfield blushed deeply as his father
thus addressed him.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear boy&mdash;you make no reply,” resumed
Mr. Hatfield, with the smile&mdash;and a smile
of ineffable satisfaction it was&mdash;still playing upon
his pale countenance: “has Lady Frances offended
you? Did she not receive you on your arrival ere
now with as much kindness as the rest?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;yes,” exclaimed Charles; “and she
appeared to me more exquisitely beautiful than
ever! Fool that I was&mdash;insensate dolt&mdash;idiot&mdash;madman,
ever to place myself in a position
which&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do not excite yourself thus, my dear boy,” interrupted
Mr. Hatfield. “You admire Lady Frances?”
he observed, after a short pause, and now
attentively watching his son’s countenance.</p>

<p>“My God! do not ask me that question, my dear
father!” ejaculated Charles, with an expression of
deep anguish on his features. “I love my beautiful
cousin&mdash;I love her&mdash;and she cannot be mine! Oh!
since I have been absent I have pondered on her
image&mdash;I have cherished it as if it were that of a
guardian angel! I have compared the amiability
and excellence of Frances with the character of
<em>that woman</em>&mdash;and you may judge how resplendently
the charming girl shines by means of such a contrast!”</p>

<p>“And you may hope&mdash;yes, you may hope, Charles,”
said Mr. Hatfield, raising himself partially up in the
bed. “Happiness yet awaits you.”</p>

<p>“Happiness&mdash;hope&mdash;my dear father!” ejaculated
Charles; “you speak in enigmas&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;I speak only what I mean; and all I say
is intelligible,” interrupted Mr. Hatfield. “I tell
you that you may hope for happiness&mdash;that Lady
Frances may yet become your wife!”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” cried the young man, clasping
his hands in the wildness of his joy. “But how?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
Is that woman dead?” he demanded, speaking with
strange rapidity of utterance.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;she is not dead,” responded his father:
“but she has married again!”</p>

<p>“Married!” ejaculated Charles. “And yet I do
not see how that circumstance will alter my position,”
he added, in a desponding tone.</p>

<p>“Listen attentively&mdash;and do not excite yourself
at one moment, and in the next give way to despair,”
said Mr. Hatfield.</p>

<p>Charles seated himself at his father’s bed-side,
and prepared to hear with attention the words that
were about to be addressed to him.</p>

<p>“Some time ago&mdash;when it was first resolved that
you should proceed to Italy for a short time,” said
Mr. Hatfield, “the Earl of Ellingham communicated
to me the generous views which he entertained
with regard to you. He observed that,
as you had already discarded the woman who had
ensnared you, and as she had agreed never more to
molest you, you were morally severed in respect to
the matrimonial bond. He moreover declared that
should this woman contract another marriage and
thereby prove that such severance was complete,
it would be a despicable fastidiousness and a contemptible
affectation to tell you <em>that you must never
know matrimonial happiness, but that you must remain
in your present false position, a husband without
a wife, for the remainder of your days</em>. Those
were the very words which his lordship used,
Charles, on the occasion to which I am alluding.”</p>

<p>“Oh! am I to understand&mdash;” exclaimed the
young man.</p>

<p>“Silence!” interrupted Mr. Hatfield: “be not
impatient nor impetuous&mdash;but hear me out. Lord
Ellingham continued to observe that if the woman
should contract a new marriage, and if <em>you</em>, Charles,
manifested contrition for the past,&mdash;if your conduct
were such as to afford sure guarantees for the
future,&mdash;and if your attachment for Lady Frances
should revive,&mdash;under all those circumstances the
Earl declared that he should not consider himself
justified in stamping the unhappiness alike of yourself
and his daughter by refusing his consent to
your union.”</p>

<p>“Do I hear aright?” exclaimed Charles, a giddiness
coming over him through excessive joy. “Oh!
what generosity on the part of the Earl!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;his sentiments on this subject were fraught
with liberality,” returned Mr. Hatfield. “He argued
in the following manner:&mdash;A young man is ensnared
into an alliance with a woman whom he
believed to be pure, but whom in a few hours he
discovered to be a demon of pollution. They separate
upon written conditions of the most positive
character,&mdash;a private arrangement being deemed
preferable to the public scandal of an appeal to the
tribunals. This woman marries again&mdash;and every
remnant of a claim which she might have had upon
the individual whom she had ensnared and deluded,
ceases at once. There is a complete snapping of the
bond&mdash;a total severance of the tie; and her conduct
by the fact of the second marriage proves that she
so understands it. The law may certainly proclaim
the first marriage to be the only legal one: but
morality, which holds marriage to be a covenant
between two parties, revolts against the principle
which the code establishes. It is upon these grounds
that the Earl of Ellingham will give you the hand
of his lovely and amiable daughter.”</p>

<p>It were useless to attempt to describe the joy
which filled the soul of Charles Hatfield when these
tidings met his ears. He seized his father’s hand
and pressed it to his lips with grateful fervour:
then, promising to return in a few minutes, he flew
to the library where he understood the Earl to be
at the moment; and casting himself at the feet of
that good nobleman, he implored pardon for his past
conduct, declaring that nothing should induce him
to swerve from the path of rectitude in future.</p>

<p>The Earl of Ellingham raised the contrite young
man&mdash;embraced him affectionately&mdash;and bade him
throw a complete veil over all that related to his
unfortunate marriage. His lordship then repeated,
but more concisely, the observations which Mr.
Hatfield had already made to his son; and at the
conclusion of the interview he said, “And now,
Charles, if your inclinations really and truly prompt
you to take the step, you have my permission to
solicit Lady Frances to allow you to become the
suitor for her hand.”</p>

<p>Captain Hatfield expressed his liveliest gratitude
in suitable terms; and hastening back to his father,
he narrated all that had just occurred between
himself and the Earl. Mr. Hatfield was cheered
and delighted by the spectacle of his son’s happiness,
and bade him repair to the drawing-room to
pass an hour with the ladies.</p>

<p>We need scarcely state that Lady Georgiana was
much pleased by the return of Charles to England,
especially as he had so highly distinguished himself
in the Neapolitan campaign. Nor less was the
Countess of Ellingham&mdash;the amiable Esther&mdash;gratified
by an event which restored the missing one to
the family circle: while Lady Frances attempted
not to conceal the joy that the young soldier’s
presence afforded her.</p>

<p>It is not, however, our purpose to dwell upon this
subject:&mdash;for we have now to relate an incident
which led to consequences of great importance to
several persons who have figured in our narrative.</p>

<p>The day after Charles Hatfield’s arrival in London,
he was proceeding on foot up Regent Street,
in order to pay a visit to his tailor for the purpose
of making some additions to his wardrobe, when
he met Captain Barthelma: for Laura’s husband
had lost his title of Count of Carignano, in consequence
of the establishment of the Republic in Castelcicala.</p>

<p>The young Italian was alone; and the meeting
between the two was most friendly and cordial,&mdash;for
during the short time that they were acquainted,
Charles had observed many excellent qualities on
the part of Barthelma, who on his side was enraptured
with the heroic conduct that Captain Hatfield
had displayed at the battle of Sabino, a full narrative
of which had duly appeared in the English
newspapers.</p>

<p>Taking the arm of Charles, Captain Barthelma
walked with him up Regent Street; and for some
time they conversed upon the late Neapolitan campaign&mdash;the
glorious destinies of Republican Castelcicala&mdash;the
noble conduct of President Markham&mdash;and
various other matters connected with the
Italian’s native land.</p>

<p>“It has grieved me greatly in one sense,” observed
Barthelma, “that I should have been absent from
my post about the person of General Markham at a
time when such momentous incidents were taking
place. But on the other hand I rejoice in my withdrawal
from that hero’s service, inasmuch as I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
thereby secured the hand of one of the most lovely&mdash;nay,
<em>the</em> most lovely woman in the world.”</p>

<div id="i_401" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_401.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I congratulate you most sincerely upon having
formed an alliance which appears to afford you so
much happiness,” answered Charles; “and I hope
to have the honour of being presented to the signora&mdash;for
I presume you have espoused a lady belonging
to your own country.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;she is an Englishwoman,” returned Captain
Barthelma; “and you have seen her.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed Charles.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you have seen her,” repeated the Italian.
“But tell me&mdash;do you recollect that day when you,
Lieutenant Di Ponta, and myself walked together
in the Champs Elys&eacute;es in consequence of a mysterious
note which we received from a pretended
Spanish refugee&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I well remember that day!” exclaimed
Captain Hatfield. “Indeed, how could I
ever forget it?”</p>

<p>“You speak with excitement, my dear friend,”
said Barthelma, surprised at his companion’s manner,
but entertaining not the slightest suspicion of
the real cause of his agitation.</p>

<p>“Ah! if you only knew all!” observed the young
man. “But I will tell you enough to warn you
against falling into the power of the vilest woman
that ever wore an angel shape to conceal a demon
heart: I will reveal to you sufficient to place you on
your guard against that syren, should you ever happen
to encounter her. For her disposition is such
that, to gratify her wantonness, her caprice, or her
avarice, she would as readily prey upon a married as
on an unmarried man.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! you interest me,” said the Castelcicalan,
still altogether unsuspicious of the real meaning of
the allusion.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but the interest will soon become of an
appalling character,” resumed Charles, speaking
in a tone of deep solemnity. “For there is in the
world a woman whose loveliness is so superhuman
and whose witchery is so irresistible that she would
move the heart of an anchorite. This woman was
born in Newgate, where her mother was incarcerated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
on a charge of forgery, and whence she was
soon afterwards transported to Australia. The
child was called <em>Perdita</em>, or ‘The Lost One;’ and
the mother took the babe with her to her place
of exile. Years passed away&mdash;and Perdita had
grown up to a lovely girl. But the natural wantonness
of her disposition manifested itself at a very
early age; and her profligacy soon became notorious
at Sydney. Well, in due time the mother returned
to England, Perdita accompanying her; and in
London did those women commence their grand
scheme of preying upon the public. Alas! shall I
confess how weak&mdash;how mad&mdash;how insensate I
was? But the delirium has passed away&mdash;and I
now look back upon it with a loathing which prevents
me from contemplating it coolly. For I was
ensnared by that vile Perdita&mdash;and I became her
victim. I proceeded with her to Paris; and my
father followed to rescue me from ruin. He discovered
the place of our abode, and painted the
character of that woman in such frightful&mdash;such
appalling colours, without the least exaggeration,
that I was reduced to despair on account of the
conduct which I had pursued. I quitted Paris&mdash;returned
to London&mdash;and was then received into the
service of General Markham. But you ere now
asked me if I remembered the day when yourself
Di Ponta and I walked together in the Champs
Elys&eacute;es. You shall now judge whether I have reason
to retain the incident in my memory. For you,
Barthelma, cannot have forgotten that lady who so
much attracted your notice, and who purposely let
fall her parasol&mdash;&mdash;But, heavens! what is the
matter with you?” ejaculated Captain Hatfield,
perceiving that his companion started as if a ghastly
spectre had suddenly sprang up before him.</p>

<p>“My God! is it possible?&mdash;that woman&mdash;in the
Champs Elys&eacute;es&mdash;” gasped the young Italian, a
deadly pallor overspreading his countenance, while
he staggered backward and would have fallen had
not Charles sustained him by the arm.</p>

<p>“That woman&mdash;for a lady I can scarcely call her&mdash;was
Perdita Mortimer,” said Hatfield, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Oh! malediction upon the hateful syren!” exclaimed
Barthelma, terribly excited.</p>

<p>“Compose yourself!&mdash;what is the matter?” cried
Charles. “You will attract observation&mdash;the people
will notice you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am composed&mdash;yes, I am cool and collected
now,” murmured the unhappy young Italian, all his
tremendous imprudence bursting upon his comprehension
like a thunder-storm. “Here&mdash;let us pass
up this street&mdash;it is comparatively deserted&mdash;and
we can converse more at our ease,” he faltered painfully,
as he dragged his companion up New Burlington
Street.</p>

<p>A suspicion had in the meantime flashed to the
imagination of Charles Hatfield. Was it possible
that Barthelma could have married the profligate
Perdita, or Laura? He himself had not learnt
from his father how he knew that the syren-demoness
was married again, or whom she had thus
ensnared;&mdash;and the Italian’s sudden excitement
could not be accounted for otherwise than by the
fact that he had made her his wife.</p>

<p>“My God! this intelligence is overwhelming!”
murmured Captain Barthelma. “Oh! my dear
friend,” he exclaimed, turning with the abruptness
of an almost maddening excitement towards Hatfield,
“pity me&mdash;pity me; that woman of whom you
have spoken is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is what?” demanded Charles impatiently.</p>

<p>“My wife!” responded Barthelma;&mdash;and the
moment the words were uttered his excitement gave
way to a blank despair.</p>

<p>“Malediction upon my communicativeness&mdash;my
insane garrulity!” ejaculated Charles. “I shall
never&mdash;never forgive myself for having made these
most uncalled-for revelations!”</p>

<p>“Do not blame yourself, my dear friend,” returned
the young Italian, in a tone of the deepest melancholy:
“you knew not how painfully your words
would affect me&mdash;you could not anticipate that the
warning which you generously intended to convey
would come far too late!”</p>

<p>“And, after all, there may be some error&mdash;some
mistake,” cried Charles, catching at a straw on
behalf of his afflicted companion: “the woman
whom I mean may not be the same as the lady
whom you have espoused&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes: ’tis the same!” ejaculated the Italian,
impatiently: “Laura Mortimer&mdash;the beauteous
creature whom we saw in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, and
whose mother met with a horrible death some
months ago.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that old woman is no more!” exclaimed
Charles. “But of what nature was the death of
which you speak so shudderingly?”</p>

<p>“The frightful incident occurred when you were
in Italy,” answered Barthelma. “Some villain
broke a bottle of aqua-fortis or vitriol over her
head&mdash;and she died in fearful agonies. But I must
leave you now, my dear friend,” said the Castelcicalan,
with wild abruptness of manner; and hastily
wringing both of Hatfield’s hands, he darted away
and was out of sight in a few moments.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CCVII">CHAPTER CCVII.<br />

<span class="medium">MR. GREEN’S OFFICE.</span></h2>

<p>On the same morning, and at about the same
time that Charles Hatfield and Captain Barthelma
thus encountered each other in Regent Street,
certain incidents of importance to the thread of our
narrative occurred elsewhere.</p>

<p>We must request the reader to accompany us to
a newly fitted up suite of offices in Warwick Court,
Holborn; and in the private room we shall find
Mr. Green seated at a desk covered with papers.</p>

<p>A material alteration had taken place in the
external appearance of this individual. He was
well dressed&mdash;looked clean and neat&mdash;and wore an
air of assurance instead of the downcast, obsequious,
grovelling demeanour that had characterised
him when in the service of Mr. Heathcote.</p>

<p>His private room was neatly furnished and had
a business-like aspect: in the front office two
clerks were busily employed in drawing up statements
to be laid before counsel in several heavy
suits; and in the passage outside a process-server
was waiting for instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. Green had drawn his table near the fire that
blazed in the grate&mdash;for the reader must remember
that several months had elapsed since the
adventures of this individual with Jack Rily, and it
was now the commencement of February, 1847.</p>

<p>The cheerful flames roared half-way up the
chimney;&mdash;and as Green felt the genial heat diffusing
a glow throughout his frame, he smiled
triumphantly as he contrasted his present position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
with what it was in those times when he was compelled
to sit without a fire, from nine in the morning
till six in the evening, on the hard high stool in
Heathcote’s front office. Now he was a solicitor
on his own account&mdash;had his name once more in
the Law List&mdash;could look with complacency into
his banker’s book&mdash;and, when business was over for
the day, had nothing to do but to step into an
omnibus and ride as far as the door of his neat
little dwelling at Bayswater.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that Mr. Green’s countenance
had lost its downcast look and its haggard, broken-hearted
expression: no wonder that hope beamed
in his eyes, and that his tone and manner had recovered
the assurance, if not the actual dignity, of
former days.</p>

<p>On the particular morning of which we are
writing, Mr. Green was more than usually elate;
and as he looked over the papers that lay before
him, the inward exultation which he experienced
imparted the glow of animation to his features.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened and his junior clerk
appeared, saying, “Mr. Heathcote, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let him walk in,” returned Green, assuming a
cold tone: but his heart was palpitating violently
with mingled feelings of joy, triumph, and insatiate
revenge.</p>

<p>In a few moments James Heathcote entered the
room.</p>

<p>But, oh! how changed was that man, not only in
countenance but also in deportment! His face was
thin&mdash;haggard&mdash;care-worn: his eyes, sunken in
their sockets, were dim and glazed;&mdash;his form was
bowed;&mdash;and in the course of a few months his hair
had turned from an iron grey to a stainless white.
His aspect was deplorable; and his manner was
indicative of deep mental distress&mdash;anxiety&mdash;suffering&mdash;and
humiliation.</p>

<p>“Sit down, sir,” said Green, in a patronising
tone.</p>

<p>Heathcote placed his hat upon the floor and took
a chair: then, fixing his hollow eyes upon his ex-clerk,
he was about to open his business&mdash;but, unable
to bear up against the tide of reminiscences
that rushed to his soul, he burst into tears.</p>

<p>Green affected not to notice this ebullition of
grief; but deliberately poked the fire.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the old lawyer sate sobbing
in the presence of the man whom he had trampled
upon during the long period of his vassalage; and
at length recovering sufficient composure to enable
his tongue to give utterance to the ideas that were
uppermost, he said, “Mr. Green, you are doubtless
astonished to receive a visit from <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>“Not at all, sir: I expected it,” was the laconic
reply.</p>

<p>“And wherefore should you have expected it?”
asked Heathcote, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Because the result of yesterday’s trial in the
Court of Queen’s Bench places you completely in
the power of my victorious client,” responded
Green; “and you are likewise well aware that every
other action pending against you must he decided
in the same manner.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I cannot close my eyes to that fact,” observed
Heathcote, actually wringing his hands.</p>

<p>“And therefore you are ruined&mdash;totally ruined,”
returned Green, with a demoniac smile of triumph.</p>

<p>“Ruined&mdash;totally ruined!” repeated Heathcote,
with that mechanical unconsciousness which is indicative
of despair&mdash;blank despair.</p>

<p>“Not only ruined in pocket, but in character
likewise,” resumed Green, his tone becoming merciless&mdash;nay,
absolutely savage and ferocious. “That
long trial of yesterday&mdash;a trial which occupied
eight hours&mdash;revealed you in your true colours to
all the world. The counsel whom I employed, tore
you to pieces. All your chicanery was unravelled&mdash;all
your manœvres traced, followed up, and exposed&mdash;all
your fraudulent proceedings dragged to
light. Oh! you, who never spared a human being,
Mr. Heathcote, were not spared yesterday: you,
who never pitied a living soul, were not pitied
yesterday! The barrister resembled a giant, and
you a dwarf whom he held up writhing and shrieking
in presence of the whole court&mdash;aye, the whole
country. Every newspaper published this morning,
contains a long account of the proceedings;&mdash;and
by this time your character stinks in the nostrils
of the entire profession.”</p>

<p>“Then am I not sufficiently punished, Mr.
Green?” asked Heathcote, the tears rolling down
his thin, emaciated, and sallow countenance.
“Since you first commenced these numerous suits
against me, I have not known a moment’s peace.
Sleep has scarcely ever visited my pillow: the awful
gulph of infamy and disgrace was always yawning
at my feet. Look at me, Mr. Green&mdash;look at me!
Am I not changed? My God! I am twenty years
older than I was on that day when you quitted me
in such anger and with such dreadful threats!”</p>

<p>“And those threats shall be fulfilled to the very
letter&mdash;yes, to the very letter,” said Mr. Green, in
a tone of unmitigated bitterness. “I told you that
there should be war between us&mdash;war to the very
knife;&mdash;and I have kept my word! I told you that
ere a few months had elapsed, you would bitterly
repent your conduct to one who only asked for a
little kindness in return for his faithful services;&mdash;and
you have already repented! But my memory
is immortal, Mr. Heathcote&mdash;and I can never, never
forget the injuries, the insults, the degradations,
and the wrongs I have received at your hands.
My thirst for revenge is therefore insatiable&mdash;and
this very day shall I adopt another and still more
important proceeding with regard to you.”</p>

<p>“My God! all this amounts to a persecution!”
ejaculated Heathcote, literally writhing upon his
chair.</p>

<p>“Call it what you will, sir,” responded Green,
savagely: “no words&mdash;no entreaties&mdash;no menaces&mdash;no
prayers on your part can stay me in the course
which I am adopting.”</p>

<p>“And that course?” said Heathcote, shuddering
with apprehension.</p>

<p>“Is an indictment at the Old Bailey for conspiracy,”
answered Green.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no: you cannot do it!” cried Heathcote,
now becoming dreadfully excited.</p>

<p>“You are lawyer enough to know that I <em>can</em> do
it,” rejoined Green, with a smile of infernal triumph.
“The evidence obtained from yesterday’s proceedings
inculpated another person with you in the
fraud&mdash;the damnable fraud that you practised upon
my client years ago; and at this very moment my
clerks are drawing up the statement to be submitted
to counsel with a view to an indictment
against yourself and your accomplice!”</p>

<p>“I could have borne everything but this!” exclaimed
the miserable man, covering his face with
his two thin hands, and then shaking his head
wildly, as if in a species of hysteria.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and you suspected that such would be
the course that I should adopt,” resumed Green:
“for it is precisely the measure that you yourself
would have taken in similar circumstances. What
you have done to others, Mr. Heathcote, shall now
be done to you;&mdash;and it were as reasonable to implore
the forbearance of a ravenous tiger, as to
appeal to me for mercy!”</p>

<p>“One word, Mr. Green&mdash;one word!” ejaculated
Heathcote, starting from his seat. “I will at once&mdash;yes,
this very moment&mdash;surrender up all the
various sums and properties you claim on behalf of
the numerous clients whom you represent <em>against</em>
me,&mdash;I will satisfy and liquidate all your demands&mdash;leaving
myself a beggar&mdash;yes, a beggar upon the
face of the earth&mdash;on condition that you abandon
this criminal prosecution!”</p>

<p>“Peruse that list of my clients and the amount
of their claims,” said Green, handing the wretched
man a paper.</p>

<p>“The sum is enormous&mdash;frightful!” exclaimed
Heathcote, his countenance becoming hideous to
gaze upon.</p>

<p>“And to that amount must be added a thousand
pounds to satisfy me for the costs which I shall lose
by the compromise,” returned Green, with implacable
coldness both of tone and manner.</p>

<p>“As God is my judge, I cannot command that
additional thousand pounds which you stipulate
for!” cried Heathcote, trembling with nervous excitement.</p>

<p>“Then apply to your brother, Sir Gilbert,” responded
Green, a sardonic smile curling his lips.</p>

<p>“He is not in England&mdash;he has gone abroad, I
know not whither!” exclaimed the miserable man.
“Months have now elapsed since his mistress became
reconciled to her husband, the Marquis of
Delmour&mdash;and Gilbert suddenly quitted England
about the same time. He refused to see me previous
to his departure: he rejected my proposals&mdash;my
humble proposals for a reconciliation. Therefore,
were I even acquainted with his present abode,
it would be useless and vain to apply to him for
succour.”</p>

<p>“Thus is it that all your grand schemes&mdash;your
magnificent designs&mdash;your comprehensive plans,
have fallen in with a tremendous crash, burying you
in the ruins!” said Green, in a slow and measured
tone that was torturing and intolerable with its diabolical
sardonism. “Well,” he continued, after a
few moments’ pause, “I will renounce the demand
of the thousand pounds, on condition that you at
once&mdash;and ere you quit my presence&mdash;assign all
your property, of whatever kind, with a view to the
liquidation of these claims and the settlement of all
the suits pending against you.”</p>

<p>“I will do so,” said Heathcote, “provided that
you give me an undertaking to abandon all criminal
proceedings against me.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” was the response; and the two lawyers
drew up certain documents which they forthwith
exchanged: and we may observe that whereas
Green’s handwriting was firm, clear, and legible,
that of his discomfited opponent was trembling,
blotted, and indicative of a terrible excitement.</p>

<p>“My ruin&mdash;my utter ruin is now consummated!”
groaned Heathcote, wringing his hands bitterly.
“All that I had heaped up for my old age&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And that you had obtained at the sacrifice of the
happiness of hundreds,” interrupted Green, his
tone suddenly assuming the savage triumph of one
who gloats over the downfall of a hated enemy.
“But we will not prolong our interview, sir. The
day of retribution has come at last&mdash;and in a few
minutes I have wreaked the pent-up vengeance of
long years. Begone, sir&mdash;offend me not another
moment with your presence! My head clerk shall
accompany you to your own office in order that you
may place in his hands the securities and the documents
specified in the agreement that you have
given me.”</p>

<p>Heathcote made no reply: but turning hastily
away, took his departure, followed by Green’s
managing man, who received the necessary instructions
from his master.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the ruined lawyer thus quitted the
establishment of his flourishing and merciless oppressor,
when a lady wearing a thick black veil
entered the front office and requested an immediate
interview with Mr. Green. The junior clerk delivered
this message to his employer, and the lady
was forthwith introduced to the legal gentleman’s
presence in the comfortable back room.</p>

<p>A rapid glance at his visitress convinced Mr.
Green that she was likely to prove no ordinary
client: for the elegance of her dress, the gracefulness
of her demeanour, and the dignity of her gait
bespoke a lady of distinction;&mdash;and when, on taking
the chair which he hastened to place for her accommodation,
she raised her veil, he was struck by the
transcendent beauty of the countenance thus revealed
to him.</p>

<p>“We are alone together, sir,” said the lovely
stranger, looking intently around: “but can listeners
overhear anything that may pass between us?”</p>

<p>“There is no need of apprehension on that head,
madam,” answered Green. “Speak freely&mdash;and
without reserve.”</p>

<p>“I have called upon business of great importance
to myself, and which may prove most lucrative to
you,” continued the lady.</p>

<p>“Before we proceed farther, madam,” said the
lawyer, “may I request to be informed who recommended
you to me?”</p>

<p>“A client of yours who resides in Pimlico, and
with whom I am acquainted,” answered the beautiful
woman. “Perhaps you have heard mention
made of my name. I <em>was</em> the Countess of Carignano:
but I presume that, since my husband’s
native land has become a Republic and abolished
titles of nobility, I must introduce myself to you as
Signora Barthelma.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of you, madam,” responded Green:
“and I shall be delighted to number you amongst
my clients.”</p>

<p>“It is for this purpose that I have addressed myself
to you to-day,” observed Laura. “But I must
at once inform you that the object of my visit is
scarcely connected with law.”</p>

<p>“If I can serve you, madam&mdash;&mdash;” began Green,
who was completely fascinated by her beauty and
her manners.</p>

<p>“And serve yourself also?” added Laura: “yes&mdash;you
can do both! Know, then, that I cherish a
rancourous&mdash;burning hatred against two individuals&mdash;father
and son&mdash;and that the time has now come
for me to wreak my vengeance upon them. The
son has just returned from Italy&mdash;I saw his arrival
mentioned in this morning’s paper; and not another
day&mdash;not another hour can I rest ere a train be laid
that must lead to the explosion of all the happiness
they now expect to enjoy.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span></p>

<p>“And who are these persons, madam?” asked
Green.</p>

<p>“Their name is Hatfield&mdash;and they reside at the
mansion of the Earl of Ellingham, in Pall Mall,”
responded Laura. “I am acquainted with a terrific
secret regarding that family&mdash;a secret which
would make the hair of all England’s proud
aristocracy stand on end&mdash;a secret, in fine,
that now affords me the means of humbling my
two mortal enemies in the dust. Will you, sir,
become the instrument of my vengeance?&mdash;will
you perform my bidding in all respects? I know
that I ask a great deal&mdash;that I am about to involve
you in no trifling nor unimportant enterprise&mdash;and
that the business does not with propriety come
within the sphere of your professional avocations.
But the recompense shall be most liberal; and I
proffer this note for five hundred pounds as an
earnest of my intentions in that respect.”</p>

<p>Green’s eyes glistened at the sight of this generous
gift; and he hastened to assure Signora Barthelma
that he not only undertook her business
with cheerfulness, but would enter into it with as
much enthusiasm as if he were interested in it from
personal feeling.</p>

<p>“I thought that I was not deceived in your
character, from what I had heard,” observed Laura.
“For let there be no mistake nor misunderstanding
between us, Mr. Green,” she continued, fixing her
fine, large grey eyes intently upon him: “<em>you</em>
have no objection to make money&mdash;<em>I</em> have money to
dispense amongst those who serve me;&mdash;<em>you</em> will
not feel qualmish nor entertain a maudlin sentiment
of honour in matters that are likely to prove
lucrative&mdash;and <em>I</em> am ready to pay handsomely for
the assistance which you can render me.”</p>

<p>“Proceed, madam,” said Green: “we understand
each other.”</p>

<p>“Good!” ejaculated Laura; “and now listen
attentively. I am about to communicate to you
secrets of the most startling character; and it is by
the use which must be made of those revelations,
that my vengeance is to be gratified. At the same
time you are to act in this matter without suffering
it to be known that you are instigated by me. If
questioned respecting the manner in which you
became acquainted with these tremendous secrets,
you must give some evasive reply; and if my name
be suggested as your probable informant, you must
declare boldly that you never even heard of me in
your life. For those whom I am anxious to crush&mdash;overwhelm&mdash;and
cover with confusion, might tell
certain tales of a disagreeable nature concerning
myself: but if they be kept in ignorance that it is I
who am in the background, they will remain silent
in these respects. You see that I am candid with
you, Mr. Green.”</p>

<p>“And that very frankness, madam, renders me
the more anxious to serve you,” answered the unprincipled
attorney.</p>

<p>“Thanks for this assurance,” said Laura, delighted
at having found so ready and willing an
instrument to carry out her vindictive designs.
“And now for these tremendous secrets to which
I have already alluded! Learn, then, that the
elder Mr. Hatfield of whom I have spoken, and
who is a gentleman apparently of high respectability
and enjoying a good reputation,&mdash;learn, I
say, that he is in reality none other than the celebrated
highwayman Thomas Rainford of former
times! Yes&mdash;you may well start and be amazed,
Mr. Green,” continued Laura, emphatically: “but
it is the truth&mdash;the solemn truth! And it is
nothing to that revelation which I have next to
make. For this Mr. Hatfield, or rather Thomas
Rainford, was the elder son of the late Earl of
Ellingham; and, being legitimately born, he is the
rightful possessor of the peerage and the entailed
estates.”</p>

<p>“This is most wonderful!” ejaculated Green,
staring almost stupidly with amazement.</p>

<p>“I have yet other revelations to make,” continued
Laura, in a tone of subdued triumph. “Thomas
Rainford married a certain Lady Georgiana
Hatfield, and adopted <em>her</em> name. They have a son,
whose name is Charles, and who passes as their
nephew, because he is illegitimate. It is this son
whose arrival in London yesterday is announced in
this morning’s journals. The same paragraph
which records his return from Italy, hints at the
probability of his shortly leading Lady Frances
Ellingham to the altar. You know the sickening,
fulsome terms in which such matters are glanced
at in the department of fashionable intelligence?
But before such marriage shall take place, it is my
purpose to carry woe&mdash;desolation of heart&mdash;infamy&mdash;disgrace&mdash;and
the deepest, deepest humiliation
into that proud mansion! I care not that these
Hatfields should remain in ignorance of the fact
that it is really I who strike the blow: ’twill be
sufficient for me to be convinced that the blow
itself <em>is</em> struck. Do you begin to comprehend me?”</p>

<p>“I understand you altogether and completely,
madam!” exclaimed Green. “You would have me
repair forthwith to Ellingham House, and by seeking
some cause of dispute with one or more of its
inmates, seize the opportunity to proclaim aloud all
the tremendous secrets which you have just revealed
to me. Is not this your purpose?”</p>

<p>“It is,” responded Laura: then, in a lower but
more emphatic tone, she added, “And take care
that the whole proceeding be accompanied with
such circumstances of notoriety, that it must inevitably
engage the attention of the public press. In
a word, contrive that all those revelations shall
appear in print, Mr. Green; and a thousand guineas
shall be your recompense!”</p>

<p>“It shall be done, madam&mdash;it shall be done,”
answered the lawyer, his heart exulting at the idea
of the munificent reward thus promised.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I shall visit you again,” said Laura.
“But remember, this affair rests between you and
me! Should you ever encounter me when I am
walking or riding out with my husband, you will
not appear to know me: we are strangers to each
other everywhere save within the four walls of this
room!”</p>

<p>“I understand and will obey all your wishes,
madam,” returned Green.</p>

<p>The lovely but vindictive and profligate woman
then took her departure; and the lawyer lost no
time in repairing to Pall Mall.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_CCVIII">CHAPTER CCVIII.<br />

<span class="medium">PERDITA, THE LOST ONE!</span></h2>

<p>IT was about three o’clock in the afternoon when
Laura reached the villa on Westbourne Terrace;
and, having laid aside her bonnet and handsome
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
furs, she proceeded to the drawing-room, where, as
Rosalie had already informed her, her husband Lorenzo
was anxiously awaiting her presence.</p>

<p>The fact that he should have stated to the servant
his desire that she would speedily return
home, was a proceeding so unusual on his part,
appearing, as it did, to imply annoyance at her
absence, that it roused the haughty temper of the
imperious Laura; and for the first time since their
marriage, she wore a frown upon her features when
she entered his presence.</p>

<p>It was also for the first time that <em>his</em> handsome
countenance denoted a storm raging within his
breast, and all the pent-up violence of which was
about to explode against the deceitful, wanton
creature into whose character he had obtained so
complete but fatal an insight that morning.</p>

<p>“You have been asking for me, Lorenzo?” said
Laura, in a cold tone, as she seated herself with an
air of exhaustion upon a sofa.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam&mdash;I was most anxious to see you
as soon as possible,” answered the Italian, turning
abruptly away from the window at which he had
been standing, and now advancing towards her.
“When I came home an hour ago I was surprised
to find that you had been absent since mid-day.”</p>

<p>“And pray, Lorenzo, am I to be kept a prisoner
in this house?” demanded Laura, in a tone of unfeigned
surprise. “I had certain purchases to
make at different shops&mdash;and I went out in the
carriage for the purpose. Permit me to observe
that your conduct is undignified in the extreme,
since you so far forget yourself as to express your
feelings to my lady’s-maid.”</p>

<p>“My God! and were I to proclaim my feelings to
the whole world, there would be but little cause for
wonder!” exclaimed the Italian, vehemently; and
as he spoke, he thrust his hand into his bosom, and
clutched a dagger which he had concealed there.</p>

<p>But his eyes fell upon the countenance of his
wife,&mdash;that countenance so glorious in its beauty,
though now with the sombre cloud overshadowing
it;&mdash;and he would have slain her then and there, had
not his glance thus suddenly embraced all the loveliness
of her features and all the rich contours of
her splendid form. For, like a whelming tide,
rushed to his soul a thousand tender reminiscences,&mdash;vividly
recalling to his imagination all the joys
and delights he had experienced in her arms&mdash;the
fervid passion he had seen reflected in those magnificent
eyes&mdash;the luscious kisses he had imprinted on
those lips&mdash;the wanton playfulness with which her
long luxuriant hair had oft-times swept across his
cheeks&mdash;the ineffable bliss that had filled his raptured
soul when his head was pillowed on that
glowing, swelling bosom, which now palpitated with
haughty indignation,&mdash;oh! he thought of all this,
and he felt that he could not slay one so exquisitely
lovely&mdash;so transcendently beautiful!</p>

<p>“Assuredly, your humour is strange to-day,
Lorenzo,” said Laura, who, though longing to
make it up with the man whom she really and sincerely
loved, nevertheless was resolved to exact
the homage which all women under such circumstances
require&mdash;namely, the first overture towards
a reconciliation. “At one moment your eyes glare
savagely upon me as if I had given you some
mortal offence;&mdash;and now they assume an expression
of pity and commiseration. Come, sir, confess
that you have entertained some outrageous
suspicion&mdash;that you are jealous of me&mdash;and I shall
take the avowal as a proof of affection. Do
this,” she added, a faint smile of encouragement
appearing upon her lips, and allowing a glimpse
of her brilliant teeth; “do this, Lorenzo&mdash;and I
will pardon your unkindness.”</p>

<p>“Pardon <em>me</em>!” exclaimed the Italian, bitterly&mdash;for
the conduct of his wife now appeared to him
to be aggravated by levity and flippancy of the
most irritating nature, though in reality she was
totally ignorant of the fact that grave and serious
charges were agitating in his mind against her:
“pardon <em>me</em>!” he repeated, his tone now assuming
a fierceness that began to amaze and even alarm
the young woman, whose conscience, as the reader
is well aware, was not the clearest in the world.
“Oh! this is indeed a hideous mockery&mdash;a cool,
deliberate insult,” he continued,&mdash;“yes&mdash;a vile insult,
to offer to pardon <em>me</em>! What have I ever
done to offend <em>you</em>&mdash;or merit <em>your</em> forbearance
or <em>your</em> forgiveness? My God! ’tis I who have
been generous and confiding&mdash;and ’tis you who
have been the gross deceiver and the unprincipled
hypocrite!”</p>

<p>“These are harsh words, Lorenzo,” exclaimed
Laura, rising from the sofa, and drawing herself up
to her full height; and though not tall in stature,
there was nevertheless something regal and majestically
imperious in her air and bearing: “yes&mdash;they
are harsh words, I repeat&mdash;and they may lead
to a quarrel which no subsequent regrets nor
apologies can repair.”</p>

<p>“Let the quarrel be eternal&mdash;or to the very
death!” returned Lorenzo, his handsome countenance
now distorted with rage. “Oh! I am sick
of this world with its hideous deceits&mdash;its hollow
hearts&mdash;its boundless profligacy! I care not how
soon I throw off the coil of this life’s trammels:
but with my last breath shall I curse&mdash;bitterly,
bitterly curse&mdash;the odious name of <em>Perdita</em>!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated the guilty woman, now perceiving
that she was indeed unmasked: but almost
immediately recovering her self-possession, she approached
her husband and said in her softest, most
seductive tones, “You have heard evil reports concerning
me, Lorenzo: and I hope ere you prejudge
me, that I shall be allowed an opportunity to give
a full explanation. Consider my position:&mdash;it is
that of a friendless and orphan woman, about to
lose, perhaps, the only being on earth whom she
ever loved, or who has ever sincerely loved her!”</p>

<p>“Oh! how is it that such a demon heart is harboured
in such an angelic form!” cried Lorenzo
Barthelma, surveying her for a moment with mingled
pity and admiration: then immediately afterwards,
a full sense of all her tremendous profligacy and
deceit springing up in his soul, his eyes glared upon
her with the ferocity of a lynx, and a feeling of
deep and burning hatred took possession of
him.</p>

<p>“If you refuse me a hearing&mdash;if you intend to
cast me off with contumely and insult,” said Perdita,
her own eyes flashing fire in their turn&mdash;but
it seemed like living fire!&mdash;“if such be your intentions,”
she continued, in a tone of mingled bitterness
and haughty indifference, “the sooner this interview
be terminated, the better.”</p>

<p>And she advanced towards the door, her bosom
heaving with convulsions almost to bursting from
its confinement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span></p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;you shall not leave me yet, nor thus!”
cried the Italian, darting after and catching her
violently by the arm. “You <em>shall</em> have the opportunity
of explanation which you desire; and God
help you in the task!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking he forced her back to the sofa;
and then locked the door of the apartment, putting
the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>“This behaviour on your part, signor,” said Perdita,
assuming a composure which she did not&mdash;could
not feel, “is alike mean and cowardly. You seek
to intimidate me&mdash;and that is mean: you use violence
towards me&mdash;and that is cowardly. What
have you heard against me? Name the calumniator,
and recite the calumnies. But if the accusation resolve
itself into <em>this</em>,&mdash;that I was frail&mdash;weak&mdash;unchaste
before I became your wife, remember that I
never deceived you on that subject! You yourself
were my paramour before you were my husband;
and when you offered me your hand, I reminded
you that it was no virgin-bride whom you would
receive to the bridal-bed. Ere now you called me
<em>Perdita</em>&mdash;and I admit that such is my Christian
name. But am I responsible for the circumstances
which induced my mother to bestow it upon me?
You are doubtless aware, from the same source
whence you have gleaned evil tidings concerning
me, that I was born in Newgate, and that my maternal
parent gave me that odious name in a moment
of contrition. Well&mdash;is this my fault? Be
just, Lorenzo&mdash;I do not ask you to be generous;&mdash;but
again I say, be just!”</p>

<p>“I have listened to you with attention, Perdita&mdash;and
I am bound to declare that you seek to veil a
hideous depravity beneath the most specious
sophistry,” said Barthelma, speaking in a slow,
measured tone, but with a concentrated fury in his
soul. “I do not reproach you for your mother’s
crimes&mdash;I commiserate you on that score. But I
feel indignant&mdash;oh! bitterly, bitterly indignant at
all the treachery&mdash;the perfidy you have practised towards
me! I knew that you were unchaste, as you
yourself express it&mdash;but I believed that it was mere
frailty on your part, and not inveterate profligacy?
Oh! Perdita, how dared you bring to the marriage-bed
of an honourable man a body polluted with
all the vice and iniquity of a penal colony, and which
had been for years common as that of the vilest
prostitute? I gave you a noble name&mdash;circumstances
have robbed it of its aristocratic lustre&mdash;but
it is still honourable;&mdash;and now how is it menaced?
You have lavished your favours upon hundreds&mdash;you
have led a life of such frightful wantonness,
young in years as you are, that your soul has
grown old in iniquity! Oh! I know it all&mdash;I know
everything, Perdita: all the intricacies of your
character are revealed to me&mdash;I have read the
mysteries of its darkest depths&mdash;and my eyes are at
length opened to the astounding folly that I
perpetrated in linking my fate with such as
you!”</p>

<p>“Then let us separate at once,” exclaimed Perdita,
her cheeks flushing with indignation. “Wherefore
prolong this interview? Our quarrel has gone
too far and become too serious ever to admit of
pardon or oblivion.”</p>

<p>“It is not I who will seek such reconciliation,”
returned Barthelma, with terrible malignity in his
tone and manner. “I loved you, Perdita&mdash;God only
knows how tenderly, how sincerely, how devotedly
I loved you! I would have died for you,&mdash;aye, and
should have rejoiced to surrender up my life, could
such a sacrifice have benefitted you! Confident,
frank, and full of generous candour, I gave you the
love of an honourable man;&mdash;and you deceived me!
Oh! I am now no stranger to all your syren wiles&mdash;your
Circean witcheries: I recognise all that artifice
and all that duplicity in many of the circumstances
which marked our first meetings, and
which rivetted the chains that you threw around
me. What! do you suppose that I can consent to
live and become the scorn, the laughing-stock, and
the scandal of all who know me?&mdash;and think you
that I will permit <em>you</em> to go forth into the world
and point me out with taunting finger to the first
idiot whom you may win as your paramour? My
God! the thought is maddening&mdash;it sears my very
brain!”</p>

<p>And so terrible became the young Italian’s aspect,&mdash;with
his flashing eyes, convulsing countenance,
and quivering lips,&mdash;that Perdita, now seriously
alarmed, rushed to the door, forgetting that it was
locked.</p>

<p>But it opened not to her touch, and, with a cry
of terror, she turned towards her husband, who was
evidently exercising superhuman efforts to restrain
the fury that boiled in his breast and darted in lightning-shafts
from his wild eyes.</p>

<p>“O Lorenzo&mdash;Lorenzo!” she exclaimed, joining
her hands together; “what do you mean to do?&mdash;what
is it that you require of me? My God! I
know that I have been wicked&mdash;vile&mdash;profligate:
but I have been faithful to you&mdash;I have never ceased
to love you from the first moment we met! That
day in the Champs Elys&eacute;es has ever been a bright
one&mdash;aye, the brightest on which my retrospective
looks could dwell&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That day in the Champs Elys&eacute;es,” repeated
Barthelma, in a low and hollow tone, “is one accursed
in my memory and in my life! Wretch&mdash;profligate&mdash;shameless
wanton,” he exclaimed, all
his infuriate passion now bursting forth,&mdash;“how
dare you allude to that day?&mdash;how can you think
of it without the crimson blush of shame? For
whose sake did you deck yourself out so meretriciously
on that occasion?&mdash;whose jealousy was it to
inspire, that you bent your warm and lustful looks
on me that day?&mdash;whom to beguile and win back to
your arms, perhaps, was that deceptive note
written that induced me, Di Ponta, and Charles
Hatfield&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! then you know every thing!” exclaimed
Perdita, suddenly throwing off the suppliant air
and the appealing looks which she had ere now
assumed, and resolving to act with the energy natural
to her character. “It is useless, signor, to
prolong this painful interview: I have already made
the same observation&mdash;and I now wish you to understand
that I will not remain a prisoner any
longer here. Open that door and let me depart&mdash;or
I shall summon the servants.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she advanced towards the bell-pull.</p>

<p>“You menace me&mdash;you dare to menace me?”
exclaimed Barthelma, springing forward and confronting
her so as to bar the way; and his whole
frame was quivering with a rage that appeared
ready to burst forth into the ungovernable fury of
a perfect madness.</p>

<p>“How dare you thus coerce me?” demanded
Perdita, her eyes flashing fire. “Out of my path,
coward&mdash;unless you intend to enact the Italian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
bravo in this country where men are wont to be
brave and chivalrous.”</p>

<p>And, as she spoke, she pushed him disdainfully
aside.</p>

<p>But ere the eye had time to wink or the heart to
palpitate once&mdash;and while a sound, between a cry
and a yell, of frenzied rage burst from the lips of
the maddened Barthelma,&mdash;his dagger flashed before
the sight of Perdita, and was instantly buried deep
in her bosom.</p>

<p>A thrilling, agonising scream proclaimed her
mortal agony&mdash;then ceased suddenly; and, staggering
forward a few paces, she fell heavily on the
carpet&mdash;and expired!</p>

<p>Barthelma stood for a few moments rivetted to
the spot, silent and motionless with horror at the
deed which he had perpetrated; while in his soul
a revulsion of feeling took place with the whelming
rapidity that marks the ebb of a portentous
tide.</p>

<p>A mortal dread came over him&mdash;and then he
burst into an agony of tears; and throwing himself
on the still palpitating body of her whose wondrous
beauty had been his pride and his joy, he began to
lament her death in the most passionate terms.</p>

<p>But suddenly there was a sound as of several
footsteps rushing up the stairs&mdash;and then came a
loud knocking at the door, and the voices of the
valet, Rosalie, and another servant demanding what
was the matter and what meant the piercing
scream that had reached their ears.</p>

<p>Then Barthelma recollected that, as a murderer,
he would receive a murderer’s doom; and in a
moment to his appalled soul started up all the grim
and terrible array of the criminal tribunal&mdash;the
executioner&mdash;the assembled myriads&mdash;and the gibbet!</p>

<p>All the frenzy of his maddening mind returned;&mdash;and
tearing forth the stiletto from the bosom of
his slaughtered wife, he plunged it deep into his
own breast.</p>

<p>At the same instant the door of the apartment
was forced in; and the horror-stricken domestics
caught sight of their master just at the moment
that he fell upon the corpse of their mistress!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So perished this youthful pair,&mdash;each endowed
with a beauty of no ordinary kind!</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;thus died the tender, impassioned Lorenzo,
and the profligate, wanton Perdita!</p>

<p>The world has seen no loveliness superior to
hers, nor known a depravity more inveterate.</p>

<p>But was she to be blamed only, and not pitied in
the slightest degree? It were unjust thus to regard
her memory:&mdash;for, when her eyes first saw the
light, had some kind hand been nigh to receive the
innocent babe&mdash;to bear it away from that Newgate-cell
which was the ominous scene of its birth&mdash;to
rear it tenderly and save it from passing in the
arms of a felon-mother into a penal settlement,&mdash;then
to foster and cherish the growing girl with a
true maternal care&mdash;bend her mind to the contemplation
of virtue, and protect it from all bad influences&mdash;preserve
her soul from the effects of vile examples,
and inculcate principles of chastity, rectitude, and
religion,&mdash;Oh! then would the prison-born Perdita
have given by her conduct a refutation to her name,
and she would have haply excelled in every accomplishment,
every amiable characteristic, and every
endearing qualification that combine like brilliant
gems to form for the chaste woman’s brow a diadem
such as angels wear!</p>

<p>Oh! my Lady Duchess&mdash;or you, highborn daughter
of some proud Peer whose line of ancestry may
be traced back to the period of the Norman Conquest,&mdash;look
not with unmitigated disgust upon the
character of Perdita, the <em>Lost One</em>! Let pity temper
the feeling;&mdash;for&mdash;though the truth which we are
about to tell may be not over palatable&mdash;yet is the
moral which the Lost One’s history affords deserving
of consideration. Suppose, my Lady Duchess&mdash;or
you, highborn maiden,&mdash;suppose that either of
you had been ushered into this world under such
circumstances as those which attended on the birth
of Perdita;&mdash;suppose that you first saw the light in
Newgate&mdash;that you had been taken by a vile mother
to the far-off place of her exile&mdash;that you had been
reared where temptations abounded and virtuous
influences were unknown&mdash;and that every example
you had before you was evil and profligate,&mdash;what
would have been the result? Do not dare to say,
my Lady Duchess&mdash;or you, highborn maiden&mdash;that
an innate perception of right and wrong, and a natural
inclination to virtue, would have preserved
you pure, and chaste, and untainted throughout the
terrible ordeal! No&mdash;no&mdash;you would have fallen as
Perdita fell&mdash;you would have been dragged through
the mire of demoralisation as she was&mdash;you would
have imbibed the infectious poison of vice as she
did,&mdash;and, under such circumstances, you, my Lady
Duchess&mdash;and you, highborn maiden&mdash;would have
justified and illustrated in your own lives the history
of the Lost One!</p>

<p>What, then, do we wish to impress upon our
readers?&mdash;what do we seek to impress upon the
Legislature and the Government? That it is better
to adopt means to prevent crime, than to study
how to punish it when it is committed. We have a
thousand laws which proclaim how a man may be
sent to the treadmill, or to the bulks, or to the
penal colonies, or to the gibbet: but we have none
devising measures to keep him away from those
places. Everything is to punish&mdash;nothing to prevent.
The codes are crowded with enactments
inflicting penalties upon grown-up criminals,&mdash;but
do not contain a single statute for the protection of
the children of the poor against contamination.
Look at those emaciated little beings rolling about
all day long in the gutters, or eating the offal off
dust-heaps: does the law stretch forth its hand and
pluck them out of that filth which is only too painfully
emblematical of the moral mire in which
their minds are likewise wallowing? No: the law
allows them to play on unheeded; but when, a few
years afterwards, these unhappy creatures, who can
neither read nor write, and have no idea of God
nor hope nor heaven, pilfer a slice of rusty bacon or
a morsel of cheese from a shop-board in order to
satisfy the cravings of hunger&mdash;<em>then</em> does the Law
thrust forth its long arm and its great hand, and
seize upon the victims of&mdash;&mdash;what?&mdash;its own neglect!</p>

<p>Yes: those are truths which we are never wearied
of insisting upon. Session after session is frittered
away in party squabbles; but what remedial
steps are taken to moralise, christianise, and civilise
the children of the poor?

<span class="medium">MR. GREEN’S MISSION.</span></h2>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Green had taken a cab, and
ordered himself to be driven to the mansion of the
Earl of Ellingham in Pall Mall.</p>

<p>While he was proceeding thither, he threw himself
back in the vehicle and gave way to a variety of
pleasurable reflections. He considered his prospects
to be most brilliant; and he believed that he was on
the high road to amass as considerable a fortune as
that which his late master Heathcote had once enjoyed.
It was fortunate for him that he had applied
to Jack Rily in the hour of his need: the Doctor
had proved of the greatest assistance to him;&mdash;and
he resolved to run down to Woolwich some day and
call upon his old friend at the hulks. For Jack
Rily had been tried for the murder of Vitriol Bob,
and acquitted of the capital charge: but he was
condemned to two years’ imprisonment in a convict-ship
for manslaughter, the police having appeared
to give him a character which by no means recommended
him to the good opinion of the jury nor the
mercy of the Court. As for the immense quantity
of Bank-notes found upon his person at the time of
his arrest, he had positively refused to give any
satisfactory account concerning them; and as no
one stood forward to claim them, nor to throw any
light upon this mysterious subject, they were declared
to be forfeited to the Crown on the prisoner’s
conviction for manslaughter.</p>

<p>Pondering upon these and other matters, Mr.
Green arrived in due course at the noble mansion
in Pall Mall; and on inquiring for Mr. Hatfield, he
was informed that this gentleman was ill in bed.</p>

<p>“But my business is of the most urgent character,”
said the attorney; “and I must see him.”</p>

<p>The domestic to whom this assurance was given,
conducted Mr. Green into a parlour, and hastened
to report to the Earl of Ellingham the presence of
the visitor.</p>

<p>The nobleman accordingly repaired to the room
in which Green was waiting, and represented to him
that Mr. Hatfield was too much indisposed to receive
any stranger.</p>

<p>“If, however,” added the Earl, “you will communicate
to me the nature of the affair which has
brought you hither, your object will be gained as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
readily as if you saw Mr. Hatfield. He is an intimate
friend of mine&mdash;indeed, a bosom friend,” said
the nobleman, emphatically; “and we have no
secrets from each other.”</p>

<p>“I must respectfully decline to open my business
to your lordship in the first instance,” returned Mr.
Green. “But I should be glad if your lordship
would witness what I have to say to Mr. Hatfield.”</p>

<p>“Your card informs me that you are an attorney,
sir,” said the Earl of Ellingham: “may I ask if the
object of your visit be of a legal nature?&mdash;because
in that case, you would do well to address yourself
to my solicitor.”</p>

<p>“You must excuse me, my lord,” was the laconic
answer, “if I decline giving any explanations.”</p>

<p>“Although I consider your behaviour to be far
from courteous, Mr. Green,” said the Earl, “I will
communicate to Mr. Hatfield your desire to have
an interview with him; and perhaps, under the circumstances,
he may see you.”</p>

<p>“Good, my lord,” responded the attorney. “I am
in no particular hurry&mdash;and will cheerfully wait an
hour or two in order to have the pleasure of seeing
Mr. Hatfield.”</p>

<p>The Earl of Ellingham forthwith repaired to his
half-brother’s room, and mentioned to him all that had
occurred. Mr. Hatfield, though feeling weak after
the long illness which he had experienced, considered
the behaviour of the visitor to be so extraordinary
that it was advisable to grant the interview demanded.</p>

<p>Lord Ellingham accordingly returned to the parlour,
and thence conducted the attorney to the
chamber where Mr. Hatfield was lying in bed.</p>

<p>The invalid cast a rapid and searching glance at
Green as he entered the room; but he recognised in
the visitor no one with whom he remembered to
have ever been acquainted.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the door closed, when it opened
again&mdash;and the Countess of Ellingham, accompanied
by Lady Georgiana, made her appearance: but, on
perceiving a stranger, they both drew back and were
about to withdraw.</p>

<p>“There are no secrets here, ladies&mdash;no secrets, I
can assure you,” exclaimed Mr. Green, with a smirking
expression of countenance, which, nevertheless,
had a deep malignity in it.</p>

<p>“In that case, come in,” said Lord Ellingham;
and the two ladies accordingly entered the room.</p>

<p>“Will you now explain the object of your visit,
sir?” asked Mr. Hatfield, who had observed the
sinister aspect which the attorney’s features had
ere now assumed, and who entertained a vague presentiment
of evil.</p>

<p>“I must begin by informing you,” said Green,
taking a seat, and glancing around on those present,
as much as to intimate that he spoke to no one in particular,
but was addressing them all collectively,&mdash;“I
must begin by informing you that I am a very
extraordinary person in one respect&mdash;which is, that
I am constantly ferretting about amongst old papers,
musty documents, and ancient records; and while
engaged in this occupation I frequently light upon
strange secrets&mdash;very strange indeed.”</p>

<p>While he was yet uttering these last words, the
rapid look which he threw around convinced him
that he had already made a most unpleasant impression
upon his auditory: for the ladies both
turned pale and started&mdash;while the Earl and Mr.
Hatfield exchanged glances significant of alarm.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;such is the case,” continued Mr. Green,
chuckling inwardly, though maintaining an external
composure: “and amongst the most singular&mdash;the
most astounding of the secrets which I have
thus dragged to light, the one that I have discovered
in connexion with your lordship’s family, is not the
least remarkable.”</p>

<p>As he thus spoke, the attorney fixed his eyes
upon the nobleman, who coloured deeply in spite
of himself: for it naturally struck him that Green
alluded to matters with which the reader is already
well acquainted. The same apprehension seized
upon Hatfield, Lady Georgiana, and the Countess
of Ellingham; and the suspense which the lawyer’s
auditory now endured, was poignant in the extreme.</p>

<p>“Your lordship can of course conjecture to what
I allude,” continued Green; “and you, Mr. Hatfield,”
he added, turning towards the invalid, “cannot
possibly misunderstand me.”</p>

<p>Lady Georgiana rose from the seat which she
had taken on entering the room, and proceeded to
place herself instinctively as it were near the head of
the couch, so as to be close to her husband. It was
a movement which said as eloquently as if her lips
had simultaneously explained it&mdash;“This man menaces
evil: but I am near to console you with all
the sympathy of a loving wife.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Green,” exclaimed the Earl of Ellingham,
after a few moments’ reflection, “I appeal to you
whether it will not be better that these matters
at which you have glanced should be discussed
privately between yourself and me. Mr. Hatfield
has been ill&mdash;very ill: and it would be cruel to
excite him at the moment when he is approaching
convalescence.”</p>

<p>“I have already stated to your lordship that
whatever communication I have to make must be
in the presence of witnesses,” returned the implacable
Green. “I presume that this lady,” he
added, with a gentle inclination of his head towards
the invalid’s wife, “is Lady Georgiana Hatfield?”</p>

<p>“You are correct, sir,” observed the lady herself,
with a haughty tone and distant manner.</p>

<p>“And this lady is the Countess of Ellingham,
doubtless?” said Green, altogether unabashed.</p>

<p>The beautiful Esther bowed in an affirmative
reply.</p>

<p>“But what mean these questions, sir?” demanded
the Earl, impatiently. “Surely you will not use
language that may prove outrageous to the feelings
of ladies who have never offended you?”</p>

<p>“If the truths which I am about to utter should
prove so very disagreeable to hear, my lord,” responded
Green, “they must be equally unpleasant
to cherish in the depths of the soul. In a word,
you are doubtless all too much accustomed to contemplate
these truths to be liable to any startling
effect when they are shaped in words and whispered
to the ear.”</p>

<p>“This is an insolence of behaviour, sir, which I
cannot&mdash;will not tolerate,” exclaimed the Earl of
Ellingham. “You shall not force your way into
the bosom of a family with a view to play upon
their feelings with a cruelty that is as refined as it
is unaccountable.”</p>

<p>“Very good, my lord,” returned Green, rising
from his seat, and taking up his hat; “I can as
easily proclaim from the head of the stairs&mdash;or in
the hall of your mansion&mdash;every thing I know relative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
to your family, as I can talk the matter quietly
over with you in this room.”</p>

<p>And the villain was moving towards the door,
when Lord Ellingham caught him by the arm, saying,
“Nay&mdash;you must not leave us thus! What
object have you in view?&mdash;what use do you propose
to make of the secrets which you have discovered?
Speak frankly&mdash;candidly&mdash;openly: is it money that
you require?”</p>

<p>A new idea flashed to the mind of Mr. Green, as
these words fell upon his ears.</p>

<p>By serving Signora Barthelma he would gain a
thousand guineas, half of which sum was already in
his possession: he had therefore only another five
hundred to receive&mdash;and it was possible that he
might obtain as many thousands by striking a bargain
with the nobleman and making a market of
the secrets in his possession.</p>

<p>“Wherefore does your lordship ask me if I require
money?” he demanded, by way of sounding the
Earl’s intentions.</p>

<p>“Because I am rich enough to bribe you,” was
the unhesitating response: for the nobleman had
already formed a pretty accurate idea of the attorney’s
character.</p>

<p>Green paused&mdash;reflected&mdash;and began to grow embarrassed.
He knew not how to act&mdash;how much to
demand&mdash;what terms to propose. Fearful of spoiling
all, by carrying his extortionate views too high,
he was likewise apprehensive of losing a large by
agreeing to take a small amount.</p>

<p>The Earl guessed what was passing in his mind;
and, pointing to writing materials that lay upon
the table, he said, “Draw a cheque&mdash;and I will
sign it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Green sat down, and with trembling hand
wrote a draft for five thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Lord Ellingham glanced over it, and immediately
affixed his signature to the document, inserting the
names of his bankers in the corner.</p>

<p>“Stop!” ejaculated Mr. Hatfield, starting up in
his couch: “Arthur, retain that cheque&mdash;let not
the villain take it!”</p>

<p>And the Earl of Ellingham instantly obeyed this
injunction; while Green turned, with a countenance
livid through rage and disappointment, towards
the invalid.</p>

<p>“Not one shilling shall this man extort from
us!” continued Mr. Hatfield, powerfully excited.
“His story is a fabrication! There are no documents
in existence which can have revealed our
family secrets to him. He has been sent hither by
an enemy&mdash;and who that enemy is I can too well
divine!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I understand you!” cried the Earl,
the name of <em>Perdita</em> suggesting itself immediately to
his memory: but at the same time he recollected
that neither the Countess of Ellingham nor Lady
Georgiana was acquainted with the secret of that
fatal marriage which Charles had contracted.</p>

<p>“Vile&mdash;despicable tool that you are!” resumed
Mr. Hatfield, addressing himself to the attorney:
“I can see through all your conduct as if your
very soul were transparent! The vengeance of an
enemy sent you hither&mdash;and the demand which the
Earl of Ellingham made respecting your object,
was suggestive of this extortionate deed that you
sought to perpetrate. Begone, sir&mdash;do your worst&mdash;we
fear you not! You may reveal family matters
that may cause pain&mdash;but you can do no serious
injury: for if you allude to the secrets which I
myself am referring to, your malignant aim is completely
baffled&mdash;inasmuch as the documents that
could alone corroborate your assertions, are no
longer in existence. I myself destroyed them!”</p>

<p>And thoroughly exhausted, Mr. Hatfield sank
back upon the pillow.</p>

<p>At this moment the door was hastily opened;
and Clarence Villiers rushed into the room.</p>

<p>“Pardon this abrupt intrusion,” he exclaimed,
not immediately noticing Green: “but I have news
of some importance&mdash;though of horrible interest&mdash;to
communicate. That woman Perdita, who ensnared
my friend Charles with her wiles and witcheries,
is no more!”</p>

<p>“Dead?” cried Mr. Hatfield, again starting up
in the couch.</p>

<p>“Murdered&mdash;assassinated&mdash;and by her own husband!”
ejaculated Villiers. “I was driving past
Westbourne Terrace ere now&mdash;I saw a crowd&mdash;I
heard appalling rumours&mdash;I enquired the cause&mdash;and
I learnt the outline of the frightful tragedy!
She is dead&mdash;and Barthelma, her husband, who
destroyed her, has perished by his own hand!”</p>

<p>“Then Charles is beyond all danger for the
future!” exclaimed Mr. Hatfield;&mdash;and again did
he fall back on his pillow.</p>

<p>Lady Georgiana and the Countess of Ellingham
hastened to administer restoratives to the invalid:
although they themselves were greatly excited by
the intelligence which had just arrived&mdash;for, it will
be remembered, they were aware that Charles had
fled from London with an abandoned woman who
had gained a powerful ascendancy over him; and
horrified as they were at the tidings of the murder,
they could not help feeling that all apprehension of a
relapse on the young man’s part into the meshes of
the intriguing Perdita, was now suddenly removed.</p>

<p>While the ladies were ministering to Mr. Hatfield,
Clarence Villiers had turned and recognised Green,
who was standing stupefied and motionless at the
sudden news which revealed to him that his fair
client Perdita Barthelma had been murdered!</p>

<p>“Ah! Mr. Green,” exclaimed Villiers, in astonishment
at beholding the attorney in the room;
“what brings you hither?”</p>

<p>“Do you know this person, Clarence?” demanded
the Earl, bending his looks with mingled indignation
and abhorrence upon the man.</p>

<p>“I have been acquainted with him for many
years&mdash;&mdash;” began Villiers.</p>

<p>“Stop, sir!” cried the nobleman, again seizing
the arm of the attorney, who was making for the
door. “Before you leave us, you shall be thoroughly
unmasked in the presence of a gentleman who appears
to address you as a friend.”</p>

<p>“Let me go, my lord!” exclaimed Green, struggling
to get away; for he knew that Villiers could
reveal a secret which would at once place the infamy
of his character beyond question: “let me go,
I say&mdash;you have no right to detain me against my
will!”</p>

<p>“You shall remain yet a few minutes!” cried the
Earl, holding his arm with a strong grasp. “This
villain,” continued the nobleman, turning towards
Clarence, “came hither as the instrument of that
woman Perdita’s vengeance! That such is the
fact, I have no doubt. But in a short time he
changed his character&mdash;he began to act a part for
himself&mdash;he played the scoundrel on his own account&mdash;and
he attempted to extort from me the
sum of five thousand pounds, as the purchase-money
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
for retaining all the secrets which Perdita
could alone have revealed to him!”</p>

<p>“You offered me the money&mdash;and the amount was
not extravagant, considering the purpose for which
it was to have been given,” said Green, glancing
anxiously at Clarence Villiers.</p>

<p>“I told you to name your own terms&mdash;and you
drew up this draft,” exclaimed the Earl, exhibiting
the slip of paper.</p>

<p>“Then, by heaven! forbearance in respect to such
a man as you, is a positive crime on my part!” said
Villiers, in an excited tone; and, seizing the
wretched attorney by the collar, he cried, “You go
not hence, Mr. Green, save in the custody of an
officer, and under an accusation of forgery!”</p>

<p>“Forgery!” exclaimed the Earl, in amazement;
and at the same time the ladies and Mr. Hatfield
became interested observers of the scene that was
now passing.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;forgery, my lord!” cried Villiers, still retaining
his hold upon Green. “This man was left
joint trustee with myself, on behalf of a youth who
had a small sum bequeathed to him: the money was
sold out of the funds years ago, my signature to the
power of attorney being forged! That forgery was
perpetrated by the villain before you. Some six
months ago he replaced the money&mdash;he called upon
me&mdash;he confessed the deed&mdash;he avowed his contrition&mdash;and
I promised to shield him. But now, my lord&mdash;<em>now</em>,
that he dares to set himself up as the persecutor
of those whom I have so many reasons to
esteem and revere,&mdash;<em>now</em>, that he has ventured to
direct his villanies against the peace of an amiable
family,&mdash;I cannot&mdash;will not&mdash;must not spare him!”</p>

<p>“No, Clarence&mdash;you shall keep your promise,”
said the Earl; “and perhaps the man may be moved
by gratitude to repentance.”</p>

<p>“My promise was conditional, my lord,” exclaimed
Villiers: “and if he have represented it
otherwise to a living soul, he has uttered a falsehood.
I declared to him at the time that I would
forgive him, provided he undertook to enter upon
the ways of rectitude and honesty: and it is he who
has now forfeited his solemn pledge to that effect!
No mercy, then, for this bad&mdash;this heartless man!”</p>

<p>“One word!” cried Green, in a menacing tone.
“Fulfil your threat, Mr. Villiers, and I will at once&mdash;without
the slightest hesitation or remorse&mdash;proclaim
to all the world that the man known as Mr.
Hatfield&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence, villain!” thundered Clarence: “silence!&mdash;or
I will strangle you!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;you shall not coerce me! I <em>will</em> speak
out!” cried Green, struggling to disengage himself
from the strong grasp in which he was held. “Mark
what I say&mdash;hear me&mdash;hear me, all of you! Mr.
Hatfield bears an assumed name&mdash;he is the Earl’s
eldest brother&mdash;the heir to the title&mdash;aye, and also
Thomas Rainford, who was hanged at Horsemonger
Lane Gaol!”</p>

<p>A blow from the clenched fist of Villiers felled
the attorney as these last words burst from his
lips;&mdash;and at the same instant a wild shriek,
uttered by Lady Georgiana, rang through the room.
For Mr. Hatfield had sunk back upon the pillow,
with a low moan and a death-like pallor of countenance;&mdash;and
almost immediately afterwards, blood
oozed from his mouth.</p>

<p>All was now confusion and dismay in the chamber
of the invalid: but at this juncture, Sir John
Lascelles made his appearance. A few words, hurriedly
spoken by the Earl of Ellingham, conveyed
to the physician an idea of what had caused the relapse
of his patient; and the worthy man speedily
ordered the requisite restoratives. But these were
all in vain:&mdash;Mr. Hatfield had broken a blood-vessel
internally&mdash;and a few minutes after the arrival
of the doctor, he expired without a groan!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We must draw a veil over the scene of sorrow
which the chamber of death presented, and which
we cannot find words to describe. The intensity of
that anguish was increased by the almost frantic
grief of Charles Hatfield, who, having been out for
several hours upon his own and his father’s business,
returned but a few minutes too late to witness
the sad catastrophe.</p>

<p>He threw himself upon the corpse of his sire&mdash;uttered
the most passionate lamentations&mdash;and even
pushed his mother aside when she endeavoured to
console him.</p>

<p>But at length a reaction came; and the violence
of the young man’s grief gave way to a profound
sorrow,&mdash;a sorrow that was deeply, deeply shared
by many other hearts!</p>

<p>In the confusion that had taken place when Lady
Georgiana’s scream echoed through the room, denoting
the occurrence of something dreadful,&mdash;Green
had risen from the floor and made his escape,
inwardly cursing himself for having undertaken
to become the agent of Perdita’s vengeance.</p>

<p>But Villiers, who entertained the most sincere
friendship for Mr. Hatfield, and who was goaded
almost to madness by the conduct of the vile attorney
towards the man whom he thus loved as a
brother, vowed that such infamy should not go
unpunished. Scarcely, therefore, had the terrible
conviction burst upon all present in the chamber
of death, that Mr. Hatfield was indeed no more,
when Villiers rushed franticly in pursuit of him
whom he looked upon as the murderer!</p>

<p>The chase was successful&mdash;and in less than half
an hour, Green was in custody on a charge of
forgery!</p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>Our narrative is about to close: but ere we lay
aside the pen, a few observations are requisite in
order to render the history of each prominent character
as complete as possible. Several have already
been disposed of: but there yet remain many in
whose fate the reader may feel more or less interested;
and we accordingly proceed to sum up in a
few words all the particulars which are wanting to
the faithful accomplishment of our task.</p>

<p>Mr. Green in due time figured at the Old Bailey,
where Clarence Villiers appeared to prosecute him
for forgery; but the prisoner pleaded guilty in
order to obtain the merciful consideration of the
court, and was sentenced to transportation for seven
years, instead of for the term of his natural life. Preparatory,
however, to his expatriation, he was lodged
in one of the convict-hulks at Woolwich; and there
he encountered his friend Jack Rily the Doctor,
who, instead of consoling the wretched attorney,
only laughed at him for the tears which he shed
and the useless repinings to which he gave vent.
Mr. Green is at this present moment occupied in
the healthy but disagreeable task of repairing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
high roads in Van Diemen’s Land, in company with
some of the greatest scoundrels that ever disgraced
the human species; and he even looks back with
bitter regret to those times when he was the oppressed,
crushed, and despised instrument of James
Heathcote. Nor was it a source of solace to Mr.
Green when one fine morning, about ten months
ago, he recognised the Doctor in a new-comer who
was thus added to the gang of convicts: for Mr.
Rily, having endeavoured to stir up his brethren in
the Woolwich hulk to rebellion, was discovered in
the attempt and forthwith packed off to the island
which Nature had in the origin made a terrestrial
paradise, but which the English Government has
converted into “a den of thieves.”</p>

<p>James Heathcote, being utterly ruined by the
transfer of all his property for the benefit of the
numerous clients whom he had robbed,&mdash;for this
affair was completely carried out by Green’s head
clerk,&mdash;was compelled to abandon his fine house
and take a humble office where he strove hard to
reconstruct his once extensive business. But the
exposure which his character had received in the
Court of Queen’s Bench, proved a fatal blow to his
prospects and an insurmountable obstacle in his
path; and at the end of six months, being unable to
pay his rent, he was turned out of the little nook to
which he had retired, and plunged into the deepest
poverty. At this juncture his brother Sir Gilbert
returned to England; and James wrote him a penitential
letter, imploring his succour. The baronet
refused to see him, but generously undertook to allow
him two guineas a-week in order to keep him
from starving; and on this pittance&mdash;for such it
is in comparison with the wealth he once possessed&mdash;the
broken-down, baffled, and dispirited man
still subsists in some suburb of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Sheepshanks has experienced
many ups and downs since we last saw him at the
lunatic asylum in Bethnal Green. It appears that
one evening Dr. Swinton gave a grand supper to
the relatives and friends of his pensioners, who
were present on the occasion as usual; and that
previously to the repast being served up, the Doctor
had been holding forth in a highly eulogistic style
upon the excellent qualities, Christian virtues, and
profound piety of his chaplain. Now the Reverend
Mr. Sheepshanks was out at the time, the Doctor
both declaring and believing that “the good man
had gone to pay his usual evening visits to the poor
in the neighbourhood;” and the guests were all
very anxious for the return of the worthy individual
who possessed such numerous claims upon
their esteem, veneration, and respect. But the
truth was&mdash;and the truth <em>must</em> be told&mdash;that the
Reverend Mr. Sheepshanks, instead of visiting the
poor or even dreaming of such a thing, was smoking
his pipe and drinking his gin-and-water at the
<em>Cat and the Fiddle</em> in Globe Town; and as he happened
to take an extra pipe and two extra glasses
on this particular occasion, the fumes thereof
became more potent than the odour of sanctity.
The consequence was that on his return to the
lunatic asylum, his walk was so unsteady and irregular
that his progress up the gravel walk to the
front door resembled that of a ship tacking about
in the Channel; and when he entered the supper-room,
just as the company were sitting down to the
well-spread table, his nose was so red, his cheeks were
so flushed, and his eyes so vacant and watery, that
the Doctor inquired in a tone of bland anxiety if he
were unwell? “No, sir&mdash;I am quite well&mdash;and I
am all right!” was the somewhat savage answer.&mdash;“Then
will you have the kindness to ask a blessing,
Mr. Sheepshanks?” said the Doctor.&mdash;“No, sir,”
responded the pious gentleman: “I will see you and
the blessing at the devil first. You’re drunk, sir&mdash;and
I’m ashamed of you.”&mdash;It would be impossible
to describe the dismay&mdash;we might almost term it
horrified amazement&mdash;which this peremptory refusal
to say grace, and the scandalous attack upon Dr.
Swinton’s sobriety, produced amongst the guests.
The physician himself started up in a furious rage,
forgetful of all his propriety; and applying his right
foot to the proper quarter, he kicked the Reverend
Mr. Sheepshanks ignominiously forth from the lunatic
asylum. On the following morning this pious
gentleman, who was endowed with so many Christian
virtues, awoke in a station-house to a sense of
his altered position; but when introduced to the
notice of a magistrate for being “drunk and disorderly,
and kicking up a row at Dr. Swinton’s
door,” he boldly proclaimed himself a martyr, and
held forth at great length, and in a peculiar nasal
drone, on the vanities of this world. The magistrate
was, however, compelled to cut him short, by inflicting
a fine: but as Mr. Sheepshanks had exhausted
all his pecuniary resources at the <em>Cat and the Fiddle</em>
on the preceding evening, he was doomed to extend
his experience of worldly vanities beneath the roof
of the House of Correction. There he found that
the treadmill was one of the most uncomfortable
vanities he had ever yet encountered; and the redness
of his nose was considerably subdued by the
prison skilly. On his emancipation at the end of a
week, he took up his abode at the house of a poor
widow with whom he was acquainted, and whom he
induced to convert her front-parlour into a receptacle
for prayer-meetings. This succeeded very well
for a few months, the congregation being delighted
with Mr. Sheepshanks’ discourse, and a tolerable
amount of pence being collected every evening in
furtherance of the pious gentleman’s holy purpose
of supplying the benighted Esquimaux with flannel-jackets
and religious tracts: but the widow proving
at length to be in the family-way, and Mr.
Sheepshanks not choosing to wait to have the
paternity of the expected offspring fixed upon his
reverend shoulders, his sudden evaporation from the
neighbourhood led to the break-up of the prayer-meetings
and the total ruin of the unfortunate
woman. What became of Mr. Sheepshanks for the
next six months, we cannot say: but one fine Sunday
morning he turned up at the Obelisk in St.
George’s Fields, where he addressed a crowd in his
usual strain. His discourse was however suddenly
cut short by the presence of the poor widow,
who, wrapped in rags and with a baby in her arms,
was begging in that neighbourhood; and when the
reverend gentleman’s delinquencies were proclaimed
by the miserable woman, he was hooted, pelted, and
maltreated all up the Westminster-road, until he
managed to escape from his assailants by diving
into one of the narrow streets leading out of that
great thoroughfare. After this affair, the pious
man again disappeared for a season; and when we
last heard of him, he had given up preaching as a
trade which he had thoroughly worn out, and had
betaken himself to the highly respectable and cheering
avocation of beating the drum and playing the
month-organ&mdash;<em>alias</em> pandean pipes&mdash;for a colleague
who exhibited a Punch and Judy show.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span></p>

<p>We must now direct attention to Captain O’Blunderbuss
and Mr. Frank Curtis. Upon the strength
of the handsome pecuniary present made to them
by Lord William Trevelyan, the former forthwith
dubbed himself <em>Major</em>; and for the first six weeks
after this self-bestowed elevation, he was under the
disagreeable necessity of thrashing his bosom friend
soundly at least once a day for being oblivious of
the new rank and calling him <em>Captain</em>. At length
he succeeded in completely beating into the head of
Frank Curtis that he was really a Major; and when
they were seated together of an evening over their
whisky-and-water, at some public-house, the gallant
Irishman never failed to recount to his companion
all the military services he had rendered the State,
and all the splendours of his paternal mansion of
Blunderbuss Park, Connemara. These statements,
though ostensibly addressed to Mr. Frank Curtis,
were really intended for the behoof of the frequenters
of the parlours where they were enunciated;
and the quiet tradesmen into whose ears
the flaming narratives were thus dinned, ended by
being particularly proud of the acquaintance of
Major Gorman O’Blunderbuss. At length, what
with succulent dinners at eating-houses and oceans
of “potheen” every evening, the sum so liberally
given by Lord William Trevelyan came to a termination;
and the two friends were one day holding a
council of war&mdash;or rather sitting in “committee of
ways and means”&mdash;when a paragraph in the newspaper
informed them that Lady Blunt and her son
had been upset in a boat during an aquatic excursion
at Richmond, and drowned “in spite of all the
efforts made by the footman to save them.” Up
jumped both the Major and Frank Curtis in ectasies
of joy, dissolving themselves as a committee then and
there by kicking over the table; and away they sped
to the mansion in Jermyn Street. The Intelligence
was true: Lady Blunt and her son were no more;&mdash;and
the stout footman was disconsolate. There
was no will; and Frank Curtis accordingly found
himself, as if by magic, the heir-at-law to all those
possessions from which his uncle had sought to
exclude him years ago. The day on which the remains
of the deceased lady and her son were consigned
to the tomb, was the happiest that Major
O’Blunderbuss and his friend had ever passed in
their lives: for the gallant officer resolved to make
a regular Irish wake of it, and the good “potheen”
circulated so rapidly that the assembled mourners
alarmed the whole street with their noise and
laughter. And a most refreshing spectacle was it
when Major O’Blunderbuss, with a view to enhance
the hilarity of the scene, kicked the stout footman
completely out of the house and tossed his clothes
and wages ignominiously from the window. In the
course of a few days the two friends paid a visit to
Mr. Strongitharms, the celebrated engraver in St.
James’s Street, for the purpose of having their
cards printed with their armorial bearings on the
top; and when Frank blandly directed the shopman
who took the order to write down in
his book the names of <em>Mr. Curtis</em> and <em>Major
O’Bluntherbuss</em>, the latter exclaimed in a tone
of mingled indignation and disgust, “Be Jasus!
Frank, and your mimory grows worse and worse
ivery day: for, be the holy poker-r! and isn’t
it <em>Colonel O’Bluntherbuss</em> that I am, the new
rank being conferred upon me by her Gracious
Majesty for my services in the East Indies?”&mdash;The
shopman wrote down <em>Colonel O’Blunderbuss</em>
accordingly; and as a colonel is the gallant
gentleman known at the present day. Reader, if
you happen to be passing along Jermyn Street any
time in the evening after five o’clock, you will hear
such shouts of laughter and peals of merriment
issuing from one of the houses, that there can be
no mistake as to the identity of that dwelling. We
need not tell you the number of the mansion, because
you cannot fail to discover where Colonel
O’Blunderbuss and Mr. Curtis reside by means of
the uproarious sounds that emanate from the front-parlour,
in spite of the closed shutters and heavy
draperies. And to tell you the truth, the neighbours
look upon that house as a complete nuisance;
and rents are falling rapidly in the immediate neighbourhood&mdash;for
quiet old bachelor-gentlemen, families,
and even young blades about town, are frightened
away from the lodgings that are let in the
three or four nearest tenements on either side of
the one where the two friends have settled themselves.
But these worthies care nothing for the
opinion of their neighbours and are deaf to all
remonstrances: they lead a jolly life after their
own hearts and in their own peculiar fashion&mdash;and
to witness them in their happy domesticity, a
stranger unacquainted with their history could not
tell that the house and the fortune both belonged
to Frank Curtis, for the Colonel is as much master
of both dwelling and purse as his devoted
friend.</p>

<p>Although Rosalie, the French lady’s-maid, has
not performed a very conspicuous part on the stage
of our narrative, we are nevertheless induced to
trace her career up to the present time. Compelled
to appear as a witness at the Coroner’s Inquest
which was holden upon her late master and mistress,
she attracted the notice of a young baronet
who attended the proceedings through motives of
curiosity: and as the overtures which he subsequently
made her, were far from displeasing, she
accepted them after a due amount of affected hesitation.
The baronet was rich, and provided in a
sumptuous manner for his mistress. He hired and
furnished a house for her accommodation in a
fashionable street at the West End&mdash;bought her a
brougham and pair of handsome bays&mdash;took for her
use a box at the Opera&mdash;and allowed her fifty
guineas a month for her domestic expenses. In
return for this generosity, she treated him with a
capriciousness that would have been intolerable on
the part of a sensible man, but which only confirmed
the insensate spendthrift’s infatuation. Rosalie’s
conduct was a matter of calculation, and not
the unavoidable result of a wilful disposition. She
knew that she had only to be kind and winning, in
order to coax him into any extravagant expenditure
which would minister to her enjoyments; and
her smiles were thus literally purchased with gold
and diamonds. Six months only did the baronet’s
fortune stand this wanton devastation; and when
he could no longer draw cheques for the sums
which she required, she at once accepted the “protection”
of an old nobleman who made her very
handsome offers, and who was in his dotage. But
now mark the wayward inconsistency of this
woman’s conduct! The moment she ceased to
be dependent upon the baronet, she conceived
a violent affection for him&mdash;was never happy
save when in his society&mdash;bestowed upon him two-thirds
of the money which she received from
the ancient peer&mdash;and even stinted herself to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
supply his extravagances. She never treated him
with the slightest indication of caprice&mdash;but
served him as if she were a purchased slave,
and he a Pacha. He gave way to intemperance,
and in his drunken freaks would beat and ill-use
her. She endured it all without a murmur, so long
as he would <em>forgive</em> her when he was sober! At
length the old nobleman died one day of indigestion&mdash;and
Rosalie passed into the keeping of a
Bishop. The Right Reverend Father was one of
the most staunch supporters of all measures for the
better observance of the Sabbath. He hated Sunday
trading as something a shade or two worse than
wilful murder&mdash;and no one declaimed more eloquently
than he against the steam-boats plying on
the Lord’s Day. He even wished to prevent the
railway-trains from running on the Sabbath; and
his heart rejoiced when he read in the newspapers
that apple-women, orange-girls, and shrimp-boys
had been taken into custody for attempting to earn
a penny to buy a meal on the “day of rest.” But
every Sunday evening this respectable old prelate
made it a rule to dine with his mistress&mdash;aye, and
remain with her too until past twelve at night;
and heaven only knows what lying excuses
he made to his wife for these intervals of absence.
He was, however, far more stingy towards
Rosalie than the deceased nobleman; and
she accordingly cut him in favour of his Archdeacon,
who was as unmitigated an old sinner
as himself. Meantime the baronet continued to be
the young woman’s real favourite; and when he
happened to find himself locked up in the Queen’s
Bench Prison, she never failed to visit him every
day. Her diamonds&mdash;her jewels&mdash;her rings&mdash;her
very watch she pawned to raise the sum necessary
to procure his release; although the more his temper
grew soured by adversity, the more brutal became
his conduct towards her. From the keeping
of the Archdeacon, she passed into that of a
wealthy tradesman who had a splendid establishment
in Regent Street. He likewise had a wife
and six children; but he neglected them for the
sake of his mistress&mdash;and while he grudged the
former even common necessaries, he lavished all
his gains upon the latter. At length he learnt
that Rosalie was constantly visited by the baronet;
and he broke off the connexion. No admirer
immediately appearing to supply his place, the
Frenchwoman wrote a very pretty letter to the
Bishop, complimenting him upon his last speech
against Sunday-trading, and declaring how much
pleasure she should experience if he would honour
her with a visit. The invitation was irresistible&mdash;the
prelate went&mdash;and the result was that Rosalie
once more became his mistress. The renewal of
their connexion has not since been interrupted;
and the baronet is still the object of the young
woman’s affection&mdash;still the recipient of two-thirds
of all the money she can obtain&mdash;and still the only
person in the world who would dare to raise his
hand against her.</p>

<p>For nearly a year after his attempted suicide,
the Marquis of Delmour lived happily with his
wife, the past being buried in oblivion. Lady Delmour
devoted herself to her husband as far as her
own blighted and crushed affections would permit;
and she at least had the supreme felicity of witnessing
the unalloyed happiness which was experienced
by Lord William Trevelyan and the lovely
Agnes, who were united about six months after the
reconciliation of the young lady’s parents, the consent
of the Lord Chancellor being obtained to
sanction the marriage. But in the summer of 1847
the Marquis of Delmour was seized with a sudden
and alarming illness; and in spite of the unwearied
attentions of Sir John Lascelles and Lady Delmour,
the old nobleman succumbed to the tyrant sway of
Death. Upwards of a year has elapsed since that
event; and we observe by a recent paragraph in
the newspapers that the Marchioness has bestowed
her hand upon Sir Gilbert Heathcote.</p>

<p>Lord William Trevelyan and Agnes are as happy
as mortals can hope to be on earth. Their mode of
life is somewhat secluded&mdash;for it is in each other’s
society that their enjoyment of existence consists.
Their charity is unbounded, but bestowed privately
and unostentatiously; and although you will never
hear the name of Lord William Trevelyan proclaimed
from the platform of Exeter Hall, amidst
a list of liberal subscribers to Missionary Societies
and other legalised swindles and robberies of the
same class, yet rest assured that many and many a
poor family has reason to bless that good nobleman
and his amiable wife.</p>

<p>Timothy Splint, <em>alias</em> Tim the Snammer, continues
the occupant of a fine farm in the backwoods
of the United States: indeed, the property has spread
out to an extent which renders the denomination of
“estate” the more correct one. Joshua Pedlar and
his wife have prospered equally well in Canada;
and they are now in possession of a large mercantile
establishment at Quebec. Mrs. Bunce is dead:
but her husband still resides at Saint Peter’s Port
in Guernsey, and earns a very comfortable livelihood.
Jeffreys leads a steady, industrious life at
Liverpool, where he has became a substantial merchant,
and is deservedly respected. Had all these
persons been consigned to the horrors of transportation
to a penal colony, their redemption from
sin would have become an impossibility: but when
placed in a condition to earn an honourable independence,
even <em>murderers</em> may be put to a better use
than hanging them like dogs, or sending them into
the midst of a vile community where their example
would only produce a deeper demoralisation.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Bubbleton Styles, having failed in getting
up his Railway Company, was compelled to
pass through the Insolvents’ Court; and during the
eighteen months which have elapsed since that
event, he has turned his attention to at least a dozen
different occupations. On his discharge from the
process of white-washing in Portugal Street, he
became a wine-merchant: but finding that this market
was completely glutted, he entered the coal and coke
trade&mdash;with may be a little dealing in slates as a
necessary adjunct thereto. This speculation not
succeeding “for want of capital,” Mr. Styles turned
drysalter&mdash;then town-traveller for an ale-brewer&mdash;then
commission-agent for a house in the woollen
line&mdash;and then something else. But none of these
occupations answering his purpose, and hearing of
the good luck which had befallen his friends O’Blunderbuss
and Curtis, he put on his last clean shirt
and paid them a visit. His reception was not at
first very encouraging, inasmuch as the gallant
Irishman commenced by knocking him down and
bunging up his right eye, for the simple reason that
Mr. Styles was unaware of that formidable gentleman’s
elevation to the rank of <em>Colonel</em>, and had
called him <em>Captain</em>: but when explanations took
place, complete harmony was restored; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
worthy Bubbleton, having been made uncommonly
drunk by his two friends, received a cheque for a
hundred guineas to enable him to begin the world
again. He has made the recommencement accordingly,
and seems in a fair way to get a living by
adhering to one particular occupation instead of
having a hundred upon his hands at the same time.</p>

<p>Clarence Villiers and Adelais continue to reside
at Brompton. They are well off in a pecuniary
point of view; and though the ardent love of their
youth has mellowed down into a deep attachment,
still are they as happy in each other’s society as they
were in those days when the marriage-state was as
yet new with them. And often and often, when
seated together of an evening, do they speak with
never-failing gratitude and regret of poor Tom
Rain!</p>

<p>Our readers will doubtless recollect the manuscript
which Lord William Trevelyan discovered at
the lunatic-asylum in Bethnal Green, and which
recorded the experiences of a victim to that detestable
system of quackery which the law allows. We
may as well observe that in the course of a short
tour which the young nobleman and his wife took
to the south of France, a few months back, Trevelyan
encountered Mr. Macdonald, the author of that
lamentable history. This gentleman had completely
recovered his mental equilibrium, and was living in
a strict but happy seclusion with his Editha and
their son. Trevelyan communicated to him the circumstances
under which he had found the manuscript,
and the motives which had induced him to
convey it away from its place of concealment in the
mad-house. Macdonald expressed his fervent gratitude
for the young nobleman’s generosity; and the
papers were consigned to the flames. We will not
mention the name of the town where Mr. Macdonald
is residing: for, were we guilty of such imprudence,
the extortioner would be assuredly sent after him.</p>

<p>We have now to speak of the inmates of Ellingham
House. Reader, the family circle there is as
happy as the mournful reminiscence of Mr. Hatfield’s
sudden death will permit. Charles has become
the husband of the beautiful and accomplished
Lady Frances; and the youthful pair continue to
dwell at the Earl’s mansion. Lady Georgiana is
likewise a permanent resident beneath the same
roof; and her son amply repays her by his affectionate
devotion for any temporary uneasiness or
grief which he might have caused her at the
lamentable period of his connexion with Perdita.
Sir John Lascelles is a frequent visitor at the mansion
in Pall Mall; and we need scarcely add that he
is always a welcome guest.</p>

<p>The Republic of Castelcicala flourishes under the
free institutions which General Markham gave it.
It is the Model-State in Europe; and appears to be
the solution of a problem whether it is possible for
honest rulers, a conscientious legislature, and a
democratic system to extirpate poverty from a
country, and make an entire people contented, free,
and prosperous. There the Rights of Labour are
recognised in all the plenitude of industry’s claims:
there no man who is willing to work, can possibly
starve. Mendicity is unknown throughout the Republic;
and when the Castelcicalans read paragraphs
translated from the English papers into
their own prints, and detailing how men, women,
and children <em>die of starvation</em>&mdash;aye, and very frequently
too&mdash;in the British Islands, they say to
each other, “It is a hideous mockery to pretend that
true freedom has any existence <em>there</em>!”</p>

<p>But, thank God! the tide of liberal sentiments is
rolling rapidly over Europe&mdash;sweeping away the
remnants of feudal barbarism&mdash;levelling all oppressive
institutions&mdash;compelling tyrants to bend to the
will of the masses&mdash;and giving such an impulse to
enlightened notions as the world never saw before.
And may that tide still flow on with unabating force&mdash;not
wearing off the asperities of barbaric systems
by degrees, but whirling all abuses away at once
and in a moment;&mdash;not proceeding without certainty
or uniformity, like a stream that is sometimes
free and sometimes checked&mdash;but rushing on in a
channel that is broad and deep;&mdash;not here diverted
from its course by some obstacle&mdash;nor there dammed
up until the weight of its waters break down the
impediment,&mdash;but rolling on with a mighty and
irresistible volume, and expanding into a glorious
and illimitable flood!</p>

“An obscure threepenny print, called the <cite>Daily News</cite>,
published in its impression of November 2nd, an article purporting
to be a notice of the leading works belonging to the
sphere of Cheap Literature, but in which a vile, cowardly,
and ruffian-like attack was made upon Mrs. Reynolds’s novel
of ‘<span class="smcap">Gretna Green</span>.’ The article alluded to appeared in the
evening of the same date in the <cite>Express</cite>, a paper made up
from the contents of the other, but of whose existence we
were totally unaware until the occurrence of the matter in
question. The attack, though evidently written by some
silly boy, was so savage and malignant, and was made up of
such a pack of atrocious lies, that it became necessary to take
some kind of notice of it, although neither the <cite>Daily News</cite>
nor its evening reflex enjoy a circulation or an influence
sufficient to effect the amount of mischief which the dastardly
scribe sought to accomplish. Our solicitors were accordingly
instructed to write to the Editors of the <cite>News</cite> and
<cite>Express</cite>, requiring a complete contradiction to the libel, or
menacing an action as the alternative. The letter which our
legal advisers despatched was a gentlemanly and talented
remonstrance, which soon brought the stupid Editors of the
<cite>Daily News</cite> and the <cite>Express</cite> to reason. Bradbury and Evans,
the proprietors of those threepenny prints, shook in their
shoes at the idea of an action, they already having enough
law business on their hands in consequence of their treatment
of Messrs. Powell and Wareing:&mdash;and, accordingly, the
<cite>News</cite> and <cite>Express</cite> ate their own words, on Tuesday, Nov. 9th,
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘We have received a letter, protesting against Mrs. S. F.
Reynolds’ work of “<span class="smcap">Gretna Green</span>” being included in that
list of popular works described as marked by “looseness,
warmth of colouring in criminal scenes, and the false glow
cast around guilty indulgencies.” We must admit that
“<span class="smcap">Gretna Green</span>” does not merit this; and that, whatever
its faults it certainly contains nothing derogatory to the
character or delicacy of a lady writer.’</p>

<p>“Now let our readers mark well the atrocity of the proceeding
on the part of the <cite>News</cite> and the <cite>Express</cite>. They first
denounce ‘<span class="smcap">Gretna Green</span>’ in the strongest terms: they
are afterwards compelled, <em>by the fear of law proceedings</em>, to
’admit that “<span class="smcap">Gretna Green</span>” does not merit this, and that
it contains nothing derogatory to the character or delicacy
of a lady writer.’ Then how dared the wretched scribe to
act such a miscreant’s part as to accuse a lady of writing with
’looseness,’ when he must have known the charge to be unfounded?
He told a downright, deliberate, wilful lie: he
has proclaimed himself, and likewise admitted himself to
be, an abominable liar! And as such we denounce him.</p>

<p>“But of what value can criticisms of the <cite>News</cite> and <cite>Express</cite>
be, when a contemptible scribe is thus allowed to make the
columns of these prints the vehicle for his own beastly
malignity? What authority can belong to a reviewer who
is obliged to say on the 9th of November, ‘I was guilty of a
foul, cowardly, and unjustifiable calumny against a lady’s
character on the 2nd of November.’ And these two papers
belong to men who are so very particular that they turned
off their sub&mdash;editors. Messrs. Powell and Wareing, because,
forsooth, these gentlemen gave insertion to a particular
bankruptcy case which the bankrupt himself had written to
implore Bradbury and Evans <em>not</em> to publish!</p>

<p>“We hope the contemptible slanderer who ‘does the
criticisms’ for the <cite>News</cite> and <cite>Express</cite> will treat his readers
(two grown-up persons and a small boy for the <cite>News</cite>, and
the small boy without the grown-up persons for the <cite>Express</cite>)
with an account of the origin, progress, and present condition
of those threepenny things. If so, he must state how
the <cite>News</cite> first came out at five-pence with the intention of
smashing every thing,&mdash;how Charles Dickens was the man
entrusted with the obstetric process of introducing this
phenomenon to the world,&mdash;how froth was never so frothy,
and vapouring never so vapoury, as when the bills, placards,
and advertisements appeared,&mdash;and how the mountain at
last brought forth a mouse! In fact, no failure was ever
more miserable&mdash;more ludicrous&mdash;more contemptible than
that of the <cite>Daily News</cite>. When a friend once spoke of his
uppermost garment to Brummell, the ‘exquisite,’ laying his
finger upon the collar thereof, said, ‘Do you call this thing
a coat?’&mdash;and when the <cite>News</cite> first came out, people held it
up between the tips of their forefinger and thumb, and asked
each other innocently, ‘Do you call this thing a newspaper?’
Well, after continuing remarkably sickly for some time, and
seeing the utter folly of hoping to compete with the established
daily newspapers, Bradbury and Evans&mdash;dear, kind,
worthy souls!&mdash;said one morning to each other, ‘This will
never do: the public will not be gulled&mdash;we must really sell
our wares at what they are worth;’&mdash;and so down went the
price of the <cite>News</cite> to twopence-halfpenny! ‘Hurrah for the
<em>cheap</em> newspaper press!’ vociferated they who now affect to
look down with contempt on cheap literature altogether:
and forthwith they fetch Mr. Dilk all the way from the
<cite>Athen&aelig;um</cite> office in Wellington Street to manage their paper
for them. And such management as it has been! Mr. Dilk
knows about as much of newspapers in general as he does of
courtesy in the <cite>Athen&aelig;um</cite> in particular;&mdash;and Bradbury and
Evans very soon found that a twopenny-halfpenny daily thing
was ‘no go.’ The price is accordingly raised to threepence;
and, just to eke out by hook and by crook, the <cite>Express</cite> is
issued as an evening paper, its contents being precisely those
of the <cite>News</cite>, with perhaps half-a-dozen lines of new matter
just to make a show under the head of ‘Latest Intelligence.’
Thus has the <cite>Daily News</cite> been tinkered about in all shapes
and ways, with the hope of establishing it on some kind of
basis or another;&mdash;and, after such a career, it fancies itself
to be respectable and influential enough to undertake the
duties of Mentor! But it has entrusted the office to a disgusting
twaddler who scruples not to season his mawkish
composition with diabolical lies, as a make-shift for ‘Attic
salt.’ However, enough of this for the present:&mdash;we have
compelled the <cite>News</cite> and the <cite>Express</cite> to acknowledge themselves
to be slanderers;&mdash;but we are afraid that after all
they have got the better of us, inasmuch as they probably
provoked us only for the purpose of obtaining <em>a gratuitous
advertisement</em> through the medium of any reply which might
be made to them in <span class="smcap">The Miscellany</span>.”&mdash;<cite>Reynolds’s Miscellany,
No. 56.</cite></p></div>

The Industrious classes in Great Britain should take into
their serious consideration the ensuing plan, which the operatives
in France have submitted to the Provisional Government.
The basis of a similar scheme might be established in
London; and there are doubtless many persons, possessing
the intelligence required for the initiative of the grand work,
who would devote a few hours per week, without fee or reward,
to the foundation of so glorious an institution. The
plan alluded to is conceived as follows; but we have substituted
the equivalent sums of English money for the French
coins specified in the original document;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Petition for a bill to establish a National Pension Fund
for every workman that has attained the age of fifty-five
years.</p>

<p>“Every citizen of the two sexes from seventeen to fifty-five
years of age shall be bound to pay each day one farthing,
or 7&frac12;<em>d.</em> per month, or 7<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per annum; every town or village
shall be bound to pay for the totality of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>“Every workman employing workmen or servants is bound
to keep back this amount from their wages, and is to be considered
responsible therefore.</p>

<p>“Every father of a family who is unfortunate, and has
several mouths to support, shall be <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de jure</em> exempted from
paying his annual quota until such time as his family shall
be able to work.</p>

<p>“Are excluded from the advantages of the pension-fund
all persons having a revenue above 32<em>l.</em> a year; the most severe
laws to be made against such persons as should rob the
money of the poor.</p>

<p>“A scale of pension is to be fixed, giving 20<em>l.</em> a year at 55
years, 28<em>l.</em> at 65 years, and 44<em>l.</em> at 75 years.</p>

<p>“The pension-fund is to be for all citizens: thus bankers,
notaries, advocates, in a word, all persons who may have been
favoured by fortune all their life-time, will have as much
right to it, if they become unfortunate, as the workman who
all his life-time has known only labour and privation.</p>

<p>“What workman is there who cannot save 1&frac34;d. per week?
Who is there that would not blush to receive alms when age
shall have weakened his strength and courage?</p>

<p>“The pension which he will receive will be the economy
of his whole life; and if he throws a glance backwards, it will
be to bless the progress of civilisation.</p>

<p>“The day on which this law will pass, the payment of the
pension may commence; since from the age of 17 to 55 all
citizens will contribute to the common stock; and since the
funds, in place of being capitalised, will be distributed every
year. During 15 years the State will have little to add
in order to complete the pensions, but after that period
it will every year have some sacrifice to make. Let,
during the fifteen years, the money hitherto spent on royalty
be capitalised. Let the resources of the Civil List be added
to them, and the sum will be more than sufficient. If fears
are entertained not to obtain a sum sufficient to pay all the
pensions, let the diamonds of the crown be sold. The most
glorious crown of a government aught to be the happiness of
the people.”</p></div>

Witness the noble conduct of the Parisian operatives, as
described in the following extract from the <cite>Constitutional</cite>
newspaper:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We have already stated that by the care of the Minister
of the Interior prompt measures had been taken to ensure
the preservation of the furniture and other articles of value
at the Tuileries. The following are some further details:&mdash;The
citizen Chalon d’Arg&eacute;, one of the special commissaries
appointed by the minister, after having concerted with Captain
St. Amand, commandant of the Tuileries, proceeded to
an inventory of the jewels, objects of art, &amp;c., found there.
These gentlemen soon ascertained that the people had respected
the various articles scattered about. The apartment
of the Duke de Nemours had alone been thrown into disorder,
but nothing was taken away. The apartments of the
other members of the royal family remained intact. Not a
picture was touched in the saloons of the late Duke of
Orleans, containing, as they did, a celebrated collection. The
most valuable pictures were taken to the Louvre, under the
direction of M. M&eacute;rin&eacute;e. A great quantity of coined money
was found in the different apartments; a man of the people
conceived the idea of throwing all this money into a
baignoire, over which he placed a coverlet, so as to give
it the appearance of a couch. He then placed himself on it,
and waited in that position until some persons came up who
could save the treasure which he had collected. To give
an idea of the wealth thus preserved, we may state that on
Saturday alone four fourgons, and on Sunday two others,
transported to the Treasury masses of silver plate, as well
as coffers containing the diamonds of the ex-princesses. In
these fourgons there was property to the amount of several
millions. The same people which had contributed to save
these valuable articles helped to pack them up, and escorted
them to the national Treasury. It was a touching sight to
behold these hard hands taking up with the greatest precautions
diamonds, necklaces, jewels of all kinds. It is useless
to say that not an article in the inventory was missing. When
M. Bastide and M. Bixio, who had been entrusted by the
Provisional Government to take charge of the jewels and
other valuable property left behind in the Tuileries, and
which had been collected and packed up by men of the people,
and an inventory taken of them under the superintendence
of a student of the Polytechnic School, and a National
Guard, the Government commissioners found the chests,
trunks, and other packages in which they had been placed,
under the charge of some of the people who had been employed
in collecting them. When the whole were removed,
one of the men went up to M. Bastide, and said, ‘<em>Sir, we
have been forgotten since yesterday. It is now twelve o’clock,
and we have not yet anything to eat. Can you order me some
bread?</em> All present were deeply affected by this proof of
disinterested fidelity to men, resisting the temptation of property
at their command greater in value than any they had
ever before seen, and demanding a piece of bread as their
only reward. M. Bastide repeatedly urged the man who
spoke to him to give his name, but he constantly refused,
saying&mdash;‘<em>We want nothing more. We can earn our food by
our labour. To-morrow we shall return to work, and to-day
ask only for the bread we have been unable to obtain.</em>’ They
were then fed, and took their departure with the same resolution.”</p></div>

At the “monster meeting” in Trafalgar-square, on Monday,
March 6th, we were called upon to preside in the absence
of Mr. Cochrane. The <cite>London Telegraph</cite> contained the
ensuing sketch or outline of the speech which we delivered
on that occasion, and which we now transfer to the pages of
“<span class="smcap">The Mysteries of London</span>” simply for the purpose of convincing
our readers that we are not afraid to proclaim in all
possible ways the opinions which we have for years promulgated
through the medium of our writings:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Reynolds rose, and, suggesting that the parties present
should form a meeting to congratulate the Parisians on
their recent triumph, addressed the meeting. He had been
voted to preside at this assembly, in the absence of Mr. Cochrane.
Where that gentleman was, he could not say. His
conduct was, at least, extraordinary, in convening a meeting
which he neglected to attend. He (Mr. Reynolds) must beg
of the meeting to be orderly; it was moral force which would
gain their ends for them. Let them, therefore, show that,
though met to demand their rights, they knew how to conduct
themselves. The French revolution was a glorious
triumph of public feeling. The French had recognised the
rights of the working-classes. What the people of this country
wanted was, that every man who was willing to work and
fit for work should have work to do. (Loud cheers.) The
working-classes only wanted fair wages. They were willing
to give the fair value of labour for them. (Hear.) The right
of labour had been recognised in France; and the rights of
labour must be recognised in England. Let them not take
the leading articles of aristocratic newspapers as the public
voice; but let them listen to the shout which they would now
hear from thousands of people met to express their adhesion
to the principles of liberty. (Loud cheers). This meeting
had been called to oppose the income-tax. Let them show
by their cheers that they were opposed to all oppressive taxation.
But let them be peaceable. Let there be no disturbance.
Let them show the police and the Government-spies
in plain clothes, that the working-classes of England could
conduct themselves in a quiet orderly manner when met to
discuss their wrongs. Mr. Reynolds sat down amidst the most
vociferous cheering.”</p>

<p>In the evening of the same day we attended another
“monster meeting” held on Clerkenwell Green, on which
occasion the following outline of the speech which we delivered
was given by the <cite>London Telegraph</cite> and other newspapers:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Reynolds, the well-known author, next spoke at
some length. He drew attention to the meeting which had
taken place that day in Trafalgar-square, and commented on
the aggressive conduct of the police. The time, he also contended,
was come, when they ought no longer to mince
matters. (Cheers.) The people of France had really done
their duty, and it now remained with the people of this country
to do the same. They were bound to demand their
rights by every moral means; and if they were forced to
have recourse to bloodshed, their oppressors would have to
account for the result, not themselves. (Cheers.) He rejoiced
at the exhibition of feeling that had taken place in
France. (Cheers.) The people had raised a man to power,
who had turned round and sought, by a large array of armed
forces, to crush them. (Groans.) They, however, he rejoiced
to find, gave him his deserts, and hurled him from his
throne. (Cheers.) He was now in this country&mdash;an exiled
villain. (Cheers.) Far, indeed, was it from him (the speaker)
to wish that the tyrant should be molested or disturbed while
suffering in a foreign land the pangs of remorse. No; he
wished him to remain harmless and in insignificance.
(Hear, hear.) But he did not see why the gallant and noble
people of France were to be insulted by the feelings of sympathy
which Her Majesty and some other personages were
exhibiting towards the exiled tyrant (Hear.) He complained
of this, and particularly that the people of England
should be identified with the anti-liberal opinions of those
persons. (Hear, hear.) What, if the gallant people of France
were to be so exasperated as to declare war against this country,
would the hard-working people of England, Scotland,
and Ireland consent to be war-taxed became of the caprice
of a number of individuals&mdash;(no, no)&mdash;who, while wallowing
in luxury, had no sympathy whatever with the masses of
their fellow-creatures suffering from sickness and starvation?
Mr. Reynolds, at some length, very ably and forcibly dwelt
on the evils of class-legislation, and showed, from his writings,
that he had ever been the friend of the working-men.
He concluded, amidst much cheering, by proposing the first
resolution.”</p></div>

Letting the thieves know that he was aware of the fact
of the robbery, and demanding a portion for himself. This
is a common practice amongst thieves; and the claim of
the person thus “declaring on” is seldom disputed, even
though he had nothing to do with the robbery.</p></div>

With deep sorrow and indignation we have frequently
noticed blackguard boys and dirty vagabonds insult private
soldiers in the streets. Nothing can be more reprehensible
than such conduct as this; but we are sure that the British
soldier is too enlightened and too generous-hearted to suppose
that any respectable working-man would treat him with
indignity. There is and ought to be a deep sympathy between
the military and the operative-classes,&mdash;both alike
being diabolically oppressed by the aristocratic and wealthy
classes, and both having rights to claim, privileges to acquire,
abuses to rectify, and tyranny to subdue. In the name of
common sense and common justice, let no insult ever be
offered to the private soldier who conducts himself properly.</p></div>

It may seem astonishing how any respectable journals
could be induced to lend themselves to such disgraceful puffery:
but we will give our readers some little explanation
upon the subject. The fact is that the quacks pay in the first
instance for the insertion of the puffs as “paragraph-advertisements,”
and then quote them as being the editorial
opinions of the newspapers in which they are thus inserted!
We quote from some of the quack-advertisements a few specimens
of these “<em>ad captandum</em>” notices:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The task of preparing and producing the work entitled
* * * *, by Messrs. * * *, though apparently not one
of magnitude, demands a most intimate acquaintance with the
mysteries of a profession of the highest character. To say
that the author has produced a volume which cannot be
otherwise considered than as a treasure, and a blessing to the
community, is not saying too much; and being written by a
duly qualified medical practitioner, its pages give evidence
of the results of much personal investigation, and great researches
in the study of medicine. In a word, the work has
merits which develope no superficial attainments, and we
cordially and most earnestly recommend it for general perusal.&mdash;<cite>Weekly
Chronicle.</cite>”</p>

<p>“To the gay and thoughtless we trust this little work will
serve as a beacon to warn them of the danger attendant upon
the too rash indulgence of their passions; whilst to some it
may serve as a monitor in the hour of temptation, and to the
afflicted as a sure guide to health.&mdash;<cite>Chronicle.</cite>”</p>

<p>“Their long experience and reputation is the patient’s
guarantee, and well deserves for the work its immense circulation.&mdash;<em>Era.</em>”</p>

<p>“This is a medical publication, ably written, and developes
the treatment of a class of painful maladies which has too long
been the prey of the illiterate and the designing.&mdash;<cite>United
Service Gazette.</cite>”</p>

<p>“The author of this singular and talented work is a legally
qualified medical man, who has had considerable experience
in the treatment of the various disorders arising from the
follies of early indiscretion. The engravings demonstrate the
consequences of excesses, and, by its perusal, many questions
may be satisfactorily replied to that admit of no appeal, even
to the most confidential friend.&mdash;<cite>Era.</cite>”</p></blockquote>

<p>To explain more fully still the proceedings of the quacks
and the artfulness of quackery, we refer our readers to the
<cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite> of Sunday, July 2; and at the bottom of a
column (not in the regular advertising department) will be
found the ensuing advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“[<span class="smcap">Advertisement.</span>]&mdash;Holloway’s Pills an excellent Remedy
for Indigestion, Bilious and Liver Complaints.&mdash;All painful
and distressing sensations arising from these complaints
(which are too well known to sufferers to require a description
here of their symptoms) may be easily removed by a few
doses of this inestimable medicine; for such is its efficacy, that
the most debilitated constitutions are effectually strengthened,
and the aversion to motion overcome, thus giving buoyancy
to the spirits, creating an appetite, and promoting digestion.
At this season, when epidemics are so prevalent, these pills
should be taken, as they surpass every other remedy as a
preventative of disorders, even of the most malignant kind.
Sold by all Druggists, and at Professor Holloway’s Establishment,
244, Strand, London.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This advertisement was of course duly paid for: but Mr.
Holloway may now, if he choose to do so, quote the <cite>Dispatch</cite>
as having recommended the efficacy of his medicines to
“strengthen the most debilitated constitutions;” and the
public, trusting to such a powerful and honest authority as
the <cite>Dispatch</cite>, will be induced to purchase the pills. Our
readers can now comprehend how the medical quacks obtain
reviews of their obscene books.</p></div>

In a publication entitled <cite>The Medical Adviser</cite>, and issued
some years ago, we find the following observations relative
to quacks and quackery:&mdash;“The legislators in almost every
civilized society have considered them as pests and a disgrace
to every country where they are to be found, and penal laws
have therefore been enacted for the suppression of quackery.
The Colleges of Physicians were instituted in different kingdoms
of Europe, to examine all persons who undertook the
practice of the art, to inspect all drugs in the apothecaries’
shops, and destroy such as were unfit; and there can be no
doubt but their power extended to the examinations of nostrums
in general, and on their report, the vendors were subject
to severe penalties. In the reign of James I., an order
of council, grounded on former laws, was issued for the apprehension
of all quacks, in order to their being examined by
the censors of the College of Physicians; on that occasion
several mountebanks, water-tasters, ague-charmers, and
vendors of nostrums were fined, imprisoned, and banished.
This wholesome severity, it may be supposed, checked the
evil for a time; but in the reign of William III. it became
again necessary to put the laws in force against these base
vermin and miscreants, in consequence of which many of
them, when examined, confessed their utter ignorance to such
a degree, as to be unable either to read or write; others, it was
found, had been attempting to procure abortion in unfortunate
single women; several of them were discovered to be
fortune-tellers, match-makers, frauders, pimps, and bawds;
some of these miscreants were set in the pillory, some put on
horseback with their faces to the horse’s tail, with their noses
and lips slit, and their necks decorated with a collar of urinals,
and afterwards whipped, imprisoned, branded, and banished.”</p>

<p>The victims of quacks might even now show the scoundrels,
if they chose, that there are laws in existence fully strong
enough to punish them; and we should advise those who
have been plundered to state their cases to their solicitors.
It is intolerable that the public should be prayed upon by a
set of villains who live in splendid mansions, ride in their
carriages, and maintain luxurious tables at the expense of
the unfortunate dupes whom their advertisements entrap.</p>

<p>Several years ago, Mr. Charles Dunne, a surgeon, presented
to Parliament a petition against Quackery; and in
that well reasoned document we find the ensuing paragraph,
which, we feel convinced, our readers will peruse with interest:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That the mal-practices of quack doctors are wisely
guarded against in every country of Europe, except Britain;
for no person (under pain of fine and imprisonment), is allowed
to take the charge of the sick, or even to direct the
application of medicines, without having gone through the
proper ordeals of examination as to his professional knowledge
and acquirements. In England it is notorious that we
have not only carpenters, tailors, bricklayers’ labourers, lead-pencil-makers,
Jews old clothes men, journeymen, linen-drapers,
and men of colour, but even women quacks, who
practise their duplicities on the unwary and unthinking part
of the public, by plundering all those who have the folly to
approach them, whilst many are absolutely deprived of life
by them, and others, who have the misfortune to escape
death, are left to drag on a miserable existence with an entirely
broken constitution for the remainder of their days.
The baneful effects, too, of patent medicines, as they are
called, deserve particular notice, the composition of which is
formed in such a manner as to render their administration at
all times dangerous, and but too often fraught with death;
whereas, on the Continent, no medicines (similar to those
with us called patent) are permitted to be sold, without first
having been analyzed by the constituted chemical authorities,
and duly examined by the respective faculties of medicine.
It is clear from what occurs in law, divinity, and
physic, that a foundation or competent education by a course
of study, is essentially necessary to exercise any of these
different departments, and whoever exercises them without
this education cannot possibly do it with advantage to the
community. For an unscientific knowledge of the treatment
of any disease, even if occasionally successful in its object,
can never be trusted to; for if any unforeseen circumstance
should arise, such practitioner can neither avert the mischief,
nor find means to relieve the patient, as a man of real science
would do;&mdash;mere experience alone, devoid of science, can
have no other claim on public notice than as empiricism,
and, like a seaman, incapable of taking an observation when
anything inauspicious occurs at sea, is unable to direct his
course. Empiricism in all professions being the opposite to
science, and directed by no regular principle but the knowledge
of one or two isolated facts, is evidently hostile to the
advancement of liberal principles, and too often ruinous to
those confiding in such hollow pretensions. Empiricism,
therefore, in religion, law, politics, and physic, is the hydra
to be guarded against, as the bane of real knowledge and improvement;
and wherever encouraged, such empiricism is
always subversive of the best interests of mankind. The
great object of legislation should be to impose a wholesome
restraint on any attempt calculated to overstep the just and
fair bounds, which the welfare of the people requires.”</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
